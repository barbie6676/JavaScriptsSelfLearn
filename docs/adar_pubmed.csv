37100060,The RNA editor ADAR2 promotes immune cell trafficking by enhancing endothelial responses to interleukin-6 during sterile inflammation.,"Immune cell trafficking constitutes a fundamental component of immunological response to tissue injury, but the contribution of intrinsic RNA nucleotide modifications to this response remains elusive. We report that RNA editor ADAR2 exerts a tissue- and stress-specific regulation of endothelial responses to interleukin-6 (IL-6), which tightly controls leukocyte trafficking in IL-6-inflamed and ischemic tissues. Genetic ablation of ADAR2 from vascular endothelial cells diminished myeloid cell rolling and adhesion on vascular walls and reduced immune cell infiltration within ischemic tissues. ADAR2 was required in the endothelium for the expression of the IL-6 receptor subunit, IL-6 signal transducer (IL6ST; gp130), and subsequently, for IL-6 trans-signaling responses. ADAR2-induced adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing suppressed the Drosha-dependent primary microRNA processing, thereby overwriting the default endothelial transcriptional program to safeguard gp130 expression. This work demonstrates a role for ADAR2 epitranscriptional activity as a checkpoint in IL-6 trans-signaling and immune cell trafficking to sites of tissue injury.",2023 May 9,Immunity. 2023 May 9;56(5):979-997.e11. doi: 10.1016/j.immuni.2023.03.021.

37156877,Cathepsin B S-nitrosylation promotes ADAR1-mediated editing of its own mRNA transcript via an ADD1/MATR3 regulatory axis.,"Genetic information is generally transferred from RNA to protein according to the classic ""Central Dogma"". Here, we made a striking discovery that post-translational modification of a protein specifically regulates the editing of its own mRNA. We show that S-nitrosylation of cathepsin B (CTSB) exclusively alters the adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing of its own mRNA. Mechanistically, CTSB S-nitrosylation promotes the dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of ADD1, leading to the recruitment of MATR3 and ADAR1 to CTSB mRNA. ADAR1-mediated A-to-I RNA editing enables the binding of HuR to CTSB mRNA, resulting in increased CTSB mRNA stability and subsequently higher steady-state levels of CTSB protein. Together, we uncovered a unique feedforward mechanism of protein expression regulation mediated by the ADD1/MATR3/ADAR1 regulatory axis. Our study demonstrates a novel reverse flow of information from the post-translational modification of a protein back to the post-transcriptional regulation of its own mRNA precursor. We coined this process as ""Protein-directed EDiting of its Own mRNA by ADAR1 (PEDORA)"" and suggest that this constitutes an additional layer of protein expression control. ""PEDORA"" could represent a currently hidden mechanism in eukaryotic gene expression regulation.",2023 May 8,Cell Res. 2023 May 8. doi: 10.1038/s41422-023-00812-4.,"['Lin Z', 'Zhao S', 'Li X', 'Miao Z', 'Cao J', 'Chen Y', 'Shi Z', 'Zhang J', 'Wang D', 'Chen S', 'Wang L', 'Gu A', 'Chen F', 'Yang T', 'Sun K', 'Han Y', 'Xie L', 'Chen H', 'Ji Y']",True
36975179,The phenotype of the most common human ADAR1p150 Zα mutation P193A in mice is partially penetrant.,"ADAR1 -mediated A-to-I RNA editing is a self-/non-self-discrimination mechanism for cellular double-stranded RNAs. ADAR mutations are one cause of Aicardi-Goutières Syndrome, an inherited paediatric encephalopathy, classed as a ""Type I interferonopathy."" The most common ADAR1 mutation is a proline 193 alanine (p.P193A) mutation, mapping to the ADAR1p150 isoform-specific Zα domain. Here, we report the development of an independent murine P195A knock-in mouse, homologous to human P193A. The Adar1(P195A/P195A) mice are largely normal and the mutation is well tolerated. When the P195A mutation is compounded with an Adar1 null allele (Adar1(P195A/-) ), approximately half the animals are runted with a shortened lifespan while the remaining Adar1(P195A/-) animals are normal, contrasting with previous reports. The phenotype of the Adar1(P195A/-) animals is both associated with the parental genotype and partly non-genetic/environmental.

36913253,Genome-wide profiling of rice Double-stranded RNA-Binding Protein 1-associated RNAs by targeted RNA editing.,"RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play essential roles in regulating gene expression. However, the RNA ligands of RBPs are poorly understood in plants, not least due to the lack of efficient tools for genome-wide identification of RBP-bound RNAs. An RBP-fused adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) can edit RBP-bound RNAs, which allows efficient identification of RNA ligands of RBPs in vivo. Here, we report the RNA editing activities of the ADAR deaminase domain (ADARdd) in plants. Protoplast experiments indicated that RBP-ADARdd fusions efficiently edited adenosines within 41 nucleotides (nt) of their binding sites. We then engineered ADARdd to profile the RNA ligands of rice (Oryza sativa) Double-stranded RNA-Binding Protein 1 (OsDRB1). Overexpressing the OsDRB1-ADARdd fusion protein in rice introduced thousands of A-to-G and T-to-C RNA‒DNA variants (RDVs). We developed a stringent bioinformatic approach to identify A-to-I RNA edits from RDVs, which removed 99.7% to 100% of background single-nucleotide variants in RNA-seq data. This pipeline identified a total of 1,798 high-confidence RNA editing (HiCE) sites, which marked 799 transcripts as OsDRB1-binding RNAs, from the leaf and root samples of OsDRB1-ADARdd-overexpressing plants. These HiCE sites were predominantly located in repetitive elements, 3'-UTRs, and introns. Small RNA sequencing also identified 191 A-to-I RNA edits in miRNAs and other sRNAs, confirming that OsDRB1 is involved in sRNA biogenesis or function. Our study presents a valuable tool for genome-wide profiling of RNA ligands of RBPs in plants and provides a global view of OsDRB1-binding RNAs.",2023 May 31,Plant Physiol. 2023 May 31;192(2):805-820. doi: 10.1093/plphys/kiad158.,"['Yin S', 'Chen Y', 'Chen Y', 'Xiong L', 'Xie K']",True
36528792,RNA Editing is a Valuable Biomarker for Predicting Carcinogenesis in Ulcerative Colitis.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Ulcerative colitis [UC] can lead to colitis-associated colorectal neoplasm [CAN]. Adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing, which is regulated by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA [ADAR], induces the post-transcriptional modification of critical oncogenes, including antizyme inhibitor 1 [AZIN1], leading to colorectal carcinogenesis. Therefore, we hypothesized that ADAR1 might be involved in the development of CAN in UC. METHODS: We systematically analysed a cohort of 139 UC cases [40 acute phase, 73 remission phase, 26 CAN]. The degree of inflammation was evaluated using the Mayo endoscopic score [MES]. RESULTS: The type 1 interferon [IFN]-related inflammation pathway was upregulated in the rectum of active UC, rectum of UC-CAN and tumour site of UC-CAN patients. ADAR1 expression was upregulated in the entire colon of CAN cases, while it was downregulated in non-CAN MES0 cases. ADAR1 expression in the rectum predicted the development of CAN better than p53 or β-catenin, with an area under the curve of 0.93. The high expression of ADAR1 and high AZIN1 RNA editing in UC was triggered by type 1 IFN stimulation from UC-specific microbiomes, such as seen in Fusobacterium in vitro analyses. The induction of AZIN1 RNA editing by ADAR1, whose expression is promoted by Fusobacterium, may induce carcinogenesis in UC. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of CAN can be evaluated by assessing ADAR1 expression in the rectum of MES0 UC patients, freeing UC patients from unnecessary colonoscopy and reducing their physical burden. RNA editing may be involved in UC carcinogenesis, and may be used to facilitate the prevention and treatment of CAN in UC.",2023 May 3,J Crohns Colitis. 2023 May 3;17(5):754-766. doi: 10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjac186.,"['Takahashi K', 'Shigeyasu K', 'Kondo Y', 'Gotoh K', 'Yano S', 'Umeda Y', 'Inokuchi T', 'Xu C', 'Yoshida K', 'Umeda H', 'Takahashi T', 'Takeda S', 'Yoshida R', 'Teraishi F', 'Kishimoto H', 'Mori Y', 'Noma K', 'Okugawa Y', 'Hiraoka S', 'Michiue H', 'Tazawa H', 'Matsushita O', 'Goel A', 'Fujiwara T']",True

37221310,Identification of novel interacts partners of ADAR1 enzyme mediating the oncogenic process in aggressive breast cancer.,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtype is characterized by aggressive clinical behavior and poor prognosis patient outcomes. Here, we show that ADAR1 is more abundantly expressed in infiltrating breast cancer (BC) tumors than in benign tumors. Further, ADAR1 protein expression is higher in aggressive BC cells (MDA-MB-231). Moreover, we identify a novel interacting partners proteins list with ADAR1 in MDA-MB-231, using immunoprecipitation assay and mass spectrometry. Using iLoop, a protein-protein interaction prediction server based on structural features, five proteins with high iloop scores were discovered: Histone H2A.V, Kynureninase (KYNU), 40S ribosomal protein SA, Complement C4-A, and Nebulin (ranged between 0.6 and 0.8). In silico analysis showed that invasive ductal carcinomas had the highest level of KYNU gene expression than the other classifications (p < 0.0001). Moreover, KYNU mRNA expression was shown to be considerably higher in TNBC patients (p < 0.0001) and associated with poor patient outcomes with a high-risk value. Importantly, we found an interaction between ADAR1 and KYNU in the more aggressive BC cells. Altogether, these results propose a new ADAR-KYNU interaction as potential therapeutic targeted therapy in aggressive BC.",2023 May 23,Sci Rep. 2023 May 23;13(1):8341. doi: 10.1038/s41598-023-35517-6.,"['Binothman N', 'Aljadani M', 'Alghanem B', 'Refai MY', 'Rashid M', 'Al Tuwaijri A', 'Alsubhi NH', 'Alrefaei GI', 'Khan MY', 'Sonbul SN', 'Aljoud F', 'Alhayyani S', 'Abdulal RH', 'Ganash M', 'Hashem AM']",False
37217676,ADAR1 polymorphisms contribute to increased susceptibility in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,"Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA1 (ADAR1), catalyzing post-transcriptional adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing, promotes cancer progression and therapeutic resistance. However, very little is known about the association of ADAR1 variants with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Here we first explored the potential association of three polymorphisms (rs9616, rs2229857, and rs1127313) of ADAR1 with susceptibility in Chinese children ALL, then functionally characterized ADAR1 in ALL. Our results demonstrated that rs9616 T and rs2229857 T were associated with increased expression of ADAR1 mRNA and higher risk to ALL. Of note, a stronger risk effect of rs2229857 T genotypes was found among relapse children. Furthermore, ADAR1 knockdown specifically inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis in ALL cells. These findings give insights into a mechanism by which the risk variant at rs9616 and rs2229857 modulate ADAR1 expression and confers a predisposition and relapse risk to ALL, and representing a potential novel biomarker for pediatric ALL.",2023 May 22,Ann Hematol. 2023 May 22. doi: 10.1007/s00277-023-05285-4.,"['Cai M', 'Liu X', 'Luo A', 'Yang X', 'Yan Y', 'Liu S', 'Wang X', 'Luo Z', 'Wu X', 'Huang K', 'Yang L', 'Jiang H', 'Xu L', 'Liu X']",True
37026479,The ADAR1 editome reveals drivers of editing-specificity for ADAR1-isoforms.,"Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA ADAR1 promotes A-to-I conversion in double-stranded and structured RNAs. ADAR1 has two isoforms transcribed from different promoters: cytoplasmic ADAR1p150 is interferon-inducible while ADAR1p110 is constitutively expressed and primarily localized in the nucleus. Mutations in ADAR1 cause Aicardi - Goutières syndrome (AGS), a severe autoinflammatory disease associated with aberrant IFN production. In mice, deletion of ADAR1 or the p150 isoform leads to embryonic lethality driven by overexpression of interferon-stimulated genes. This phenotype is rescued by deletion of the cytoplasmic dsRNA-sensor MDA5 indicating that the p150 isoform is indispensable and cannot be rescued by ADAR1p110. Nevertheless, editing sites uniquely targeted by ADAR1p150 remain elusive. Here, by transfection of ADAR1 isoforms into ADAR-less mouse cells we detect isoform-specific editing patterns. Using mutated ADAR variants, we test how intracellular localization and the presence of a Z-DNA binding domain-α affect editing preferences. These data show that ZBDα only minimally contributes to p150 editing-specificity while isoform-specific editing is primarily directed by the intracellular localization of ADAR1 isoforms. Our study is complemented by RIP-seq on human cells ectopically expressing tagged-ADAR1 isoforms. Both datasets reveal enrichment of intronic editing and binding by ADAR1p110 while ADAR1p150 preferentially binds and edits 3'UTRs.",2023 May 22,Nucleic Acids Res. 2023 May 22;51(9):4191-4207. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkad265.,"['Kleinova R', 'Rajendra V', 'Leuchtenberger AF', 'Lo Giudice C', 'Vesely C', 'Kapoor U', 'Tanzer A', 'Derdak S', 'Picardi E', 'Jantsch MF']",True
37218814,"Attenuation of Dopaminergic Neurodegeneration in a C. elegans Parkinson's Model through Regulation of Xanthine Dehydrogenase (XDH-1) Expression by the RNA Editase, ADR-2.","Differential RNA editing by adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADARs) has been implicated in several neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we report results of a RNAi screen of genes differentially regulated in adr-2 mutants, normally encoding the only catalytically active ADAR in Caenorhabditis elegans, ADR-2. Subsequent analysis of candidate genes that alter the misfolding of human α-synuclein (α-syn) and dopaminergic neurodegeneration, two PD pathologies, reveal that reduced expression of xdh-1, the ortholog of human xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH), is protective against α-synuclein-induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Further, RNAi experiments show that WHT-2, the worm ortholog of the human ABCG2 transporter and a predicted interactor of XDH-1, is the rate-limiting factor in the ADR-2, XDH-1, WHT-2 system for dopaminergic neuroprotection. In silico structural modeling of WHT-2 indicates that the editing of one nucleotide in the wht-2 mRNA leads to the substitution of threonine with alanine at residue 124 in the WHT-2 protein, changing hydrogen bonds in this region. Thus, we propose a model where wht-2 is edited by ADR-2, which promotes optimal export of uric acid, a known substrate of WHT-2 and a product of XDH-1 activity. In the absence of editing, uric acid export is limited, provoking a reduction in xdh-1 transcription to limit uric acid production and maintain cellular homeostasis. As a result, elevation of uric acid is protective against dopaminergic neuronal cell death. In turn, increased levels of uric acid are associated with a decrease in ROS production. Further, downregulation of xdh-1 is protective against PD pathologies because decreased levels of XDH-1 correlate to a concomitant reduction in xanthine oxidase (XO), the form of the protein whose by-product is superoxide anion. These data indicate that modifying specific targets of RNA editing may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for PD.",2023 May 22,J Dev Biol. 2023 May 22;11(2):20. doi: 10.3390/jdb11020020.,"['Starr LA', 'McKay LE', 'Peter KN', 'Seyfarth LM', 'Berkowitz LA', 'Caldwell KA', 'Caldwell GA']",False
37240377,Identification of RNA-Binding Protein Targets with HyperTRIBE in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.,"As a master regulator in cells, RNA-binding protein (RBP) plays critical roles in organismal development, metabolism and various diseases. It regulates gene expression at various levels mostly by specific recognition of target RNA. The traditional CLIP-seq method to detect transcriptome-wide RNA targets of RBP is less efficient in yeast due to the low UV transmissivity of their cell walls. Here, we established an efficient HyperTRIBE (Targets of RNA-binding proteins Identified By Editing) in yeast, by fusing an RBP to the hyper-active catalytic domain of human RNA editing enzyme ADAR2 and expressing the fusion protein in yeast cells. The target transcripts of RBP were marked with new RNA editing events and identified by high-throughput sequencing. We successfully applied HyperTRIBE to identifying the RNA targets of two yeast RBPs, KHD1 and BFR1. The antibody-free HyperTRIBE has competitive advantages including a low background, high sensitivity and reproducibility, as well as a simple library preparation procedure, providing a reliable strategy for RBP target identification in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.",2023 May 20,Int J Mol Sci. 2023 May 20;24(10):9033. doi: 10.3390/ijms24109033.,"['Piao W', 'Li C', 'Sun P', 'Yang M', 'Ding Y', 'Song W', 'Jia Y', 'Yu L', 'Lu Y', 'Jin H']",True
37216868,Increased RNA editing sites revealed as potential novel biomarkers for diagnosis in primary Sjögren's syndrome.,"BACKGROUND: Transcriptome-wide aberrant RNA editing has been shown to contribute to autoimmune diseases, but its extent and significance in primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) are currently poorly understood. METHODS: We systematically characterized the global pattern and clinical relevance of RNA editing in pSS by performing large-scale RNA sequencing of minor salivary gland tissues obtained from 439 pSS patients and 130 non-pSS or healthy controls. FINDINGS: Compared with controls, pSS patients displayed increased global RNA-editing levels, which were significantly correlated and clinically relevant to various immune features in pSS. The elevated editing levels were likely explained by significantly increased expression of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) p150 in pSS, which was associated with disease features. In addition, genome-wide differential RNA editing (DRE) analysis between pSS and non-pSS showed that most (249/284) DRE sites were hyper-edited in pSS, especially the top 10 DRE sites dominated by hyper-edited sites and assigned to nine unique genes involved in the inflammatory response or immune system. Interestingly, among all DRE sites, six RNA editing sites were only detected in pSS and resided in three unique genes (NLRC5, IKZF3 and JAK3). Furthermore, these six specific DRE sites with significant clinical relevance in pSS showed a strong capacity to distinguish between pSS and non-pSS, reflecting powerful diagnostic efficacy and accuracy. CONCLUSION: These findings reveal the potential role of RNA editing in contributing to the risk of pSS and further highlight the important prognostic value and diagnostic potential of RNA editing in pSS.",2023 May 20,J Autoimmun. 2023 May 20;138:103035. doi: 10.1016/j.jaut.2023.103035.,"['Wang X', 'Zhu L', 'Ying S', 'Liao X', 'Zheng J', 'Liu Z', 'Gao J', 'Niu M', 'Xu X', 'Zhou Z', 'Xu H', 'Wu J']",True
37208334,ADAR1-mediated RNA editing of SCD1 drives drug resistance and self-renewal in gastric cancer.,"Targetable drivers governing 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin (5FU + CDDP) resistance remain elusive due to the paucity of physiologically and therapeutically relevant models. Here, we establish 5FU + CDDP resistant intestinal subtype GC patient-derived organoid lines. JAK/STAT signaling and its downstream, adenosine deaminases acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1), are shown to be concomitantly upregulated in the resistant lines. ADAR1 confers chemoresistance and self-renewal in an RNA editing-dependent manner. WES coupled with RNA-seq identify enrichment of hyper-edited lipid metabolism genes in the resistant lines. Mechanistically, ADAR1-mediated A-to-I editing on 3'UTR of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD1) increases binding of KH domain-containing, RNA-binding, signal transduction-associated 1 (KHDRBS1), thereby augmenting SCD1 mRNA stability. Consequently, SCD1 facilitates lipid droplet formation to alleviate chemotherapy-induced ER stress and enhances self-renewal through increasing β-catenin expression. Pharmacological inhibition of SCD1 abrogates chemoresistance and tumor-initiating cell frequency. Clinically, high proteomic level of ADAR1 and SCD1, or high SCD1 editing/ADAR1 mRNA signature score predicts a worse prognosis.

37209819,RNA editing of AZIN1 coding sites is catalyzed by ADAR1 p150 after splicing.,"Adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing is catalyzed by nuclear ADAR1 p110 and ADAR2, and cytoplasmic ADAR1 p150 in mammals, all of which recognize double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) as targets. Although its frequency is quite rare, RNA editing occurs in coding regions, which alters protein functions by exchanging amino acid sequences, and is therefore physiologically significant. In general, such coding sites are edited by ADAR1 p110 and ADAR2 prior to splicing, given that the corresponding exon forms a dsRNA structure with an adjacent intron. We previously found that RNA editing at two coding sites of antizyme inhibitor 1 (AZIN1) is sustained in Adar1 p110/Aadr2 double knockout mice. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying RNA editing of AZIN1 remain unknown. Here, we showed that Azin1 editing levels were increased upon type I interferon treatment, which activated Adar1 p150 transcription, in mouse Raw264.7 cells. Azin1 RNA editing was observed in mature mRNA but not precursor mRNA. Furthermore, we revealed that the two coding sites were editable only by ADAR1 p150 in both mouse Raw264.7 and human HEK293T cells. This unique editing was achieved by forming a dsRNA structure with a downstream exon after splicing and the intervening intron suppressed RNA editing. Therefore, deletion of a nuclear export signal from ADAR1 p150, shifting its localization to the nucleus, decreased Azin1 editing levels. Finally, we demonstrated that Azin1 RNA editing was completely absent in Adar1 p150 knockout mice. Thus, these findings indicate that RNA editing of AZIN1 coding sites is exceptionally catalyzed by ADAR1 p150 after splicing.",2023 May 18,J Biol Chem. 2023 May 18:104840. doi: 10.1016/j.jbc.2023.104840.,"['Xing Y', 'Nakahama T', 'Wu Y', 'Inoue M', 'Kim JI', 'Todo H', 'Shibuya T', 'Kato Y', 'Kawahara Y']",True
37169395,Comparison of TRIBE and STAMP for identifying targets of RNA binding proteins in human and Drosophila cells.,"RNA binding proteins (RBPs) perform a myriad of functions and are implicated in numerous neurological diseases. To identify the targets of RBPs in small numbers of cells, we developed TRIBE, in which the catalytic domain of the RNA editing enzyme ADAR (ADARcd) is fused to a RBP. When the RBP binds to a mRNA, ADAR catalyzes A to G modifications in the target mRNA that can be easily identified in standard RNA-sequencing. In STAMP, the concept is the same except the ADARcd is replaced by the RNA editing enzyme APOBEC. Here we compared TRIBE and STAMP side-by-side in human and Drosophila cells. The goal is to learn the pros and cons of each method so that researchers can choose the method best suited to their RBP and system. In human cells, TRIBE and STAMP were performed using the RBP TDP-43. Although they both identified TDP-43 target mRNAs, combining the two methods more successfully identified high confidence targets. In Drosophila cells, RBP-APOBEC fusions generated only low numbers of editing sites, comparable to the level of control editing.

37162299,ADAR1 is a prognostic biomarker and is correlated with immune infiltration in lung adenocarcinoma.,"BACKGROUND: Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is a common subtype of non-small cell lung cancer with high morbidity and mortality rates and is usually detected at advanced stages because of the early onset of metastasis. Adenosine deaminase RNA-specific 1 (ADAR1) is an RNA editing enzyme that catalyzes the important physiological process of adenosine-to-inosine editing and has been shown to participate in the progression of LUAD. Increasing evidence has suggested that immune infiltration of the tumor immune microenvironment has prognostic value for most human solid organ malignancies; however, much is unknown about the functions of ADAR1. METHODS: The expression of ADAR1 was analyzed in The Cancer Genome Atlas -LUAD database and validated in our LUAD cohort. To assess the prognostic value of ADAR1, Kaplan-Meier survival analyses and Cox regression analyses were carried out in LUAD cohorts. The association between ADAR1 and LUAD immune infiltrates via analyses of cell-type identification by estimating relative subsets of known RNA transcripts. Furthermore, multiplex immunohistochemistry was used to confirm the relationship between ADAR1 expression and immune cells in the present cohort of patients with LUAD. RESULTS: ADAR1 was highly expressed in LUAD tissues and closely correlated with lymph node metastasis (LNM) (p < 0.01), advanced tumor stage (p < 0.05), and poor patient prognosis (p < 0.01), thus indicating that increased ADAR1 contributed to the progression of LUAD. LUAD with high ADAR1 expression can metastasize to lymph nodes that express more ADAR1 than the primary lesion. In addition, M0 macrophages and M2 macrophages increased and CD4(+) T cells decreased in LUAD tissues with high ADAR1 expression. And the expression of ADAR1 in lymph node metastases was negatively correlated with the contents of CD4(+) T cells (p = 0.0017) and M1 macrophages (p = 0.0037). CONCLUSION: The findings of our study suggested that ADAR1 may be useful in predicting prognosis and LNM in LUAD, and may serve as a promising immune-related molecular target for LUAD patients.",2023 May 10,Cancer Med. 2023 May 10. doi: 10.1002/cam4.6044.,"['Yang W', 'Chen K', 'Yu Q', 'Liao R', 'He H', 'Peng Y', 'Yang Z', 'Zhang X']",True
37126200,Nuclear Export Inhibitors Selinexor (KPT-330) and Eltanexor (KPT-8602) Provide a Novel Therapy to Reduce Tumor Growth by Induction of PANoptosis.,"Programmed cell death (PCD) is a process that occurs naturally in cells in response to different endogenous or exogenous factors and facilitated by specific proteins. The three common pathways are pyroptosis, necroptosis, and apoptosis. Each pathway has its own unique proteins, mechanisms, and byproducts. Dysregulated PCD can lead to abnormal growth of cells causing tumor growth, a hallmark feature of many cancer pathologies. Recently, the PCD pathways have been considered to be activated simultaneously in a combined nature defined as PANoptosis (pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis). An integral protein, Z-DNA binding protein 1 (ZBP1) aids in the initiation of the NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, a known facilitator of pyroptosis. It also is known to bind to a regulator of necroptosis, receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3). A unique binding partner to ZBP1, adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1), is involved in RNA editing, stress mechanisms, and disease. In murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) treatment with nuclear export inhibitors (NEIs) has allowed for sequestering of ADAR1 to the nucleus, and increased incidence of cell death. Additionally, the use of interferons (IFNs) to induce ZBP1 has increased the incidence of cell death. Emerging therapies are looking at the efficacy of using a combination of NEI and IFN treatment to rapidly reduce tumor size and growth by inducing PANoptosis.

36161399,Innate immune activation without immune cell infiltration in brains of murine models of Aicardi-Goutières Syndrome.,"Chronic inflammation is frequently invoked as a mechanism of neurodegeneration and yet inflammatory cell infiltrates are seldom seen in brains of these disorders. Different disciplines utilize different technologies and methodologies to describe what is immunologically defined as the innate immune response (IIR). We examined murine models of the human neurodegenerative disease Aicardi-Goutières Syndrome, where an IIR is initiated by aberrant RNA metabolism secondary to a mutation in adenosine deaminase acting on RNA gene (ADAR1). We previously showed that these mice demonstrated a deficit in RNA editing that lead to MDA-5 mediated RNA sensing pathway activation of the IIR with massive interferon stimulated gene transcription and translation. As early as 2 weeks of age, in situ hybridization demonstrated that different central nervous system (CNS) cell lineages expressed very high levels of distinct interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) in the absence of interferon and absence of immune cell infiltrates. We have expanded these studies to more completely describe the breadth of ISG expression systemically and in CNS using double label in situ hybridization. Within the CNS aberrant ISG expression was mostly limited to neurons, microglia, ependyma, choroid plexus, and endothelial cells with little expression in oligodendroglia and astrocytes except for STAT1. Wild type controls showed a similar pattern of ISG expression but only in aged mice and at levels minimally detectable by in situ hybridization. Despite months of elevated ISG expression in mutant mice, there was essentially no inflammatory infiltrate, no interferon production and minimal glial reaction. Histomorphological neurodegenerative pathology of ventricular dilatation and deep gray matter mineralization were evident in mutant mice 8-13 months of age but this did not show a spatial relationship to ISG expression. This IIR without immune cell infiltration leads to neurodegeneration through non-canonical pathways that may accentuate normal aging pathways.",2023 May,Brain Pathol. 2023 May;33(3):e13118. doi: 10.1111/bpa.13118.

36302988,Programmable eukaryotic protein synthesis with RNA sensors by harnessing ADAR.,"Programmable approaches to sense and respond to the presence of specific RNAs in biological systems have broad applications in research, diagnostics, and therapeutics. Here we engineer a programmable RNA-sensing technology, reprogrammable ADAR sensors (RADARS), which harnesses RNA editing by adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADAR) to gate translation of a cargo protein by the presence of endogenous RNA transcripts. Introduction of a stop codon in a guide upstream of the cargo makes translation contingent on binding of an endogenous transcript to the guide, leading to ADAR editing of the stop codon and allowing translational readthrough. Through systematic sensor engineering, we achieve 277 fold improvement in sensor activation and engineer RADARS with diverse cargo proteins, including luciferases, fluorescent proteins, recombinases, and caspases, enabling detection sensitivity on endogenous transcripts expressed at levels as low as 13 transcripts per million. We show that RADARS are functional as either expressed DNA or synthetic mRNA and with either exogenous or endogenous ADAR. We apply RADARS in multiple contexts, including tracking transcriptional states, RNA-sensing-induced cell death, cell-type identification, and control of synthetic mRNA translation.",2023 May,Nat Biotechnol. 2023 May;41(5):698-707. doi: 10.1038/s41587-022-01534-5.

37185260,Emergence of biased hypermutation in a heterologous additional transcription unit in recombinant lentogenic Newcastle disease virus.,"Recombinant Newcastle disease virus (rNDV) strains engineered to express foreign genes from an additional transcription unit (ATU) are considered as candidate live-attenuated vector vaccines for human and veterinary use. Early during the COVID-19 pandemic we and others generated COVID-19 vaccine candidates based on rNDV expressing a partial or complete SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. In our studies, a number of the rNDV constructs did not show high S expression levels in cell culture or seroconversion in immunized hamsters. Sanger sequencing showed the presence of frequent A-to-G transitions characteristic of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR). Subsequent whole genome rNDV sequencing revealed that this biased hypermutation was exclusively localized in the ATU expressing the spike gene, and was related to deamination of adenosines in the negative strand viral genome RNA. The biased hypermutation was found both after virus rescue in chicken cell line DF-1 followed by passaging in embryonated chicken eggs, and after direct virus rescue and subsequent passaging in Vero E6 cells. Levels of biased hypermutation were higher in constructs containing codon-optimized as compared to native S gene sequences, suggesting potential association with increased GC content. These data show that deep sequencing of candidate recombinant vector vaccine constructs in different phases of development is of crucial importance in the development of NDV-based vaccines.",2023 May,J Gen Virol. 2023 May;104(5). doi: 10.1099/jgv.0.001851.,"['de Buhr H', 'de Leeuw OS', 'Harders F', 'Peeters BP', 'de Swart RL']",False

However, the contribution of circRNAs to OS (osteosarcoma) remains largely unknown. circRNA deep sequencing was performed to the expression of circRNAs between OS and chondroma tissues. The regulatory and functional role of circRBMS3 (a circRNA derived from exons 7 to 10 of the RBMS3 gene, hsa_circ_0064644) upregulation was examined in OS and was validated in vitro and in vivo, upstream regulator and downstream target of circRBMS3 were both explored. RNA pull down, a luciferase reporter assay, biotin-coupled microRNA capture and fluorescence in situ hybridization were used to evaluate the interaction between circRBMS3 and micro (mi)-R-424-5p. For in vivo tumorigenesis experiments, Subcutaneous and Orthotopic xenograft OS mouse models were built. Expression of circRBMS3 was higher in OS tissues due to the regulation of adenosine deaminase 1-acting on RNA (ADAR1), an abundant RNA editing enzyme. Our in vitro data indicated that ShcircRBMS3 inhibits the proliferation and migration of osteosarcoma cells. Mechanistically, we showed that circRBMS3 could regulate eIF4B and YRDC, through 'sponging' miR-424-5p. Furthermore, knockdown of circRBMS3 inhibited malignant phenotypes and bone destruction of OS in vivo. Our results reveal an important role for a novel circRBMS3 in the growth and metastasis of malignant tumor cells and offer a fresh perspective on circRNAs in OS progression.",2023 Mar 9,Aging (Albany NY). 2023 Mar 9;15(5):1564-1590. doi: 10.18632/aging.204567.

ADAR1 knockdown was performed to investigate its oncogenic functions in SiHa (HPV16), HeLa (HPV18), and Yumoto (non-HPV) CC cell lines. Cytoplasmic and nuclear ADAR1 expression were examined to clarify their correlation with clinicopathological parameters and prognosis in patients with CC. This resulted in increased apoptosis and necroptosis in HPV16 -type SiHa, HPV18-type HeLa, and non-HPV-type Yumoto CC cell lines. Progression-free survival (PFS) rates of patients exhibiting high cytoplasmic and nuclear ADAR1 expression were poorer than those in the other groups (P = 0.016). Multivariate analysis indicated that the combination of higher cytoplasmic and nuclear ADAR1 expression was an independent predictor of prognosis in patients with CC (P = 0.017).

Previously, predicting and preventing ADAR1p150-mediated malignant RNA editing represented a significant challenge. Thus, we developed lentiviral ADAR1 and splicing reporters for non-invasive detection of splicing-mediated ADAR1 adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing activation; a quantitative ADAR1p150 intracellular flow cytometric assay; a selective small-molecule inhibitor of splicing-mediated ADAR1 activation, Rebecsinib, which inhibits leukemia stem cell (LSC) self-renewal and prolongs humanized LSC mouse model survival at doses that spare normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs); and pre-IND studies showing favorable Rebecsinib toxicokinetic and pharmacodynamic (TK/PD) properties.

36921992,RNA Editing Enzyme ADAR1 Suppresses the Mobility of Cancer Cells via ARPIN.,"Deamination of adenine or cytosine in RNA, called RNA editing, is a constitutively active and common modification. The primary role of RNA editing is tagging RNA right after its synthesis so that the endogenous RNA is recognized as self and distinguished from exogenous RNA, such as viral RNA. In addition to this primary function, the direct or indirect effects on gene expression can be utilized in cancer where a high level of RNA editing activity persists. This report identified actin-related protein 2/3 complex inhibitor (ARPIN) as a target of ADAR1 in breast cancer cells. Our comparative RNA sequencing analysis in MCF7 cells revealed that the expression of ARPIN was decreased upon ADAR1 depletion with altered editing on its 3'UTR. However, the expression changes of ARPIN were not dependent on 3'UTR editing but relied on three microRNAs acting on ARPIN. As a result, we found that the migration and invasion of cancer cells were profoundly increased by ADAR1 depletion, and this cellular phenotype was reversed by the exogenous ARPIN expression. Altogether, our data suggest that ADAR1 suppresses breast cancer cell mobility via the upregulation of ARPIN.",2023 Mar 16,Mol Cells. 2023 Mar 16. doi: 10.14348/molcells.2023.2174.,"['Park MJ', 'Jeong E', 'Lee EJ', 'Choi HJ', 'Moon BH', 'Kang K', 'Chang S']",False
36469491,The RNA-editing enzyme ADAR1: a regulatory hub that tunes multiple dsRNA-sensing pathways.,"Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) is an RNA-editing enzyme that catalyzes adenosine-to-inosine conversions in double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs). In mammals, ADAR1 is composed of two isoforms: a nuclear short p110 isoform and a cytoplasmic long p150 isoform. Whereas both isoforms contain right-handed dsRNA-binding and deaminase domains, ADAR1 p150 harbors a Zα domain that binds to left-handed dsRNAs, termed Z-RNAs. Myeloma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) sensing of endogenous dsRNAs as non-self leads to the induction of type I interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes, but recent studies revealed that ADAR1 p150-mediated RNA editing, but not ADAR1 p110, prevents this MDA5-mediated sensing. ADAR1 p150-specific RNA-editing sites are present and at least a Zα domain-Z-RNA interaction is required for this specificity. Mutations in the ADAR1 gene cause Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS), an infant encephalopathy with type I IFN overproduction. Insertion of a point mutation in the Zα domain of the Adar1 gene induces AGS-like encephalopathy in mice, which is rescued by concurrent deletion of MDA5. This finding indicates that impaired ADAR1 p150-mediated RNA-editing is a mechanism underlying AGS caused by an ADAR1 mutation. ADAR1 p150 also prevents ZBP1 sensing of endogenous Z-RNA, which leads to programmed cell death, via the Zα domain and its RNA-editing activity. Furthermore, ADAR1 prevents protein kinase R (PKR) sensing of endogenous right-handed dsRNAs, which leads to translational shutdown and growth arrest. Thus, ADAR1 acts as a regulatory hub that blocks sensing of endogenous dsRNAs as non-self by multiple sensor proteins, both in RNA editing-dependent and -independent manners, and is a potential therapeutic target for diseases, especially cancer.",2023 Mar 14,Int Immunol. 2023 Mar 14;35(3):123-133. doi: 10.1093/intimm/dxac056.,"['Nakahama T', 'Kawahara Y']",True

Dubbed DART VADAR (Detection and Amplification of RNA Triggers via ADAR), our system amplifies the signal from editing by endogenous ADAR through a positive feedback loop. Amplification is mediated by the expression of a hyperactive, minimal ADAR variant and its recruitment to the edit site via an orthogonal RNA targeting mechanism.

However, many endogenous RNAs containing double-stranded regions can be misrecognized and activate innate immunity. The interferon inducible ADAR1-p150 suppresses dsRNA sensing, an essential function for ADAR1 in many cancers, including breast. Although ADAR1-p150 has been well established in this role, the functions of the constitutively expressed ADAR1-p110 isoform are less understood. We used proximity labeling to identify putative ADAR1-p110 interacting proteins in breast cancer cell lines. Of the proteins identified, the RNA helicase DHX9 was of particular interest. Knockdown of DHX9 in ADAR1-dependent cell lines caused cell death and activation of the dsRNA sensor PKR. In ADAR1-independent cell lines, combined knockdown of DHX9 and ADAR1, but neither alone, caused activation of multiple dsRNA sensing pathways leading to a viral mimicry phenotype. Together, these results reveal an important role for DHX9 in suppressing dsRNA sensing by multiple pathways.",2023 Mar 1,bioRxiv. 2023 Mar 1:2023.02.27.530307. doi: 10.1101/2023.02.27.530307.

The role of a novel lncRNA, forkhead box D1 antisense RNA 1 (FOXD1-AS1), has been discussed in multiple cancers. Nevertheless, its function and relevant mechanism in OSCC have been not probed yet. MATERIALS AND METHODS: FOXD1-AS1 expression was detected via RT-qPCR. Colony formation, EdU, transwell and Western blot analyses tested the functional role of FOXD1-AS1 in OSCC cells. The relationship between RNAs was assessed by a series of mechanical assays. RESULTS: FOXD1-AS1 was expressed at a high level in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC). Knockdown of FOXD1-AS1 exerted repressive impacts on OSCC cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and EMT. Moreover, FOXD1-AS1 positively regulated its nearby gene FOXD1 via interacting with miR-369-3p. In addition, adenosine deaminase RNA specific (ADAR), known as a RNA-binding protein (RBP), was capable to bind with FOXD1-AS1 and FOXD1 simultaneously, and could regulate the stability of FOXD1 mRNA.

36877730,Identification of exceptionally potent adenosine deaminases RNA editors from high body temperature organisms.,"The most abundant form of RNA editing in metazoa is the deamination of adenosines into inosines (A-to-I), catalyzed by ADAR enzymes. Inosines are read as guanosines by the translation machinery, and thus A-to-I may lead to protein recoding. The ability of ADARs to recode at the mRNA level makes them attractive therapeutic tools. Several approaches for Site-Directed RNA Editing (SDRE) are currently under development. A major challenge in this field is achieving high on-target editing efficiency, and thus it is of much interest to identify highly potent ADARs. To address this, we used the baker yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as an editing-naïve system. We exogenously expressed a range of heterologous ADARs and identified the hummingbird and primarily mallard-duck ADARs, which evolved at 40-42°C, as two exceptionally potent editors. ADARs bind to double-stranded RNA structures (dsRNAs), which in turn are temperature sensitive. Our results indicate that species evolved to live with higher core body temperatures have developed ADAR enzymes that target weaker dsRNA structures and would therefore be more effective than other ADARs.

In agreement with prior artworks, neural and cancer tissues were found to be enriched with recoded proteins. Quantitative analysis indicated that recoding the rate of specific sites did not directly depend on the levels of ADAR enzymes or targeted proteins themselves, rather it was governed by differential and yet undescribed regulation of interaction of enzymes with mRNA.

We observed that DNA mutations and RNA editing events are often mutually exclusive, suggesting that tumors can modulate pathway outcomes by altering sequences at either the genomic or the transcriptomic level. RNA editing targets transcripts within known disease-driving pathways such as apoptosis, p53 and NF-κB signaling, as well as the RIG-I-like pathway. In this context, we show that ADAR1-mediated editing within MAVS transcript positively correlates with MAVS protein expression levels, associating with increased interferon/NF-κB signaling and T cell exhaustion.

However, the clinical significance and biological role of DDX1 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remain elusive. Here, we examined the chemotherapeutic relevance of DDX1 in NSCLC. MAIN METHODS: We used the UALCAN database, Western blot analysis, and immunohistochemical and RT-qPCR assays to assess DDX1 expression in NSCLC cell lines (H1650 and A549) and patient tissues. The role of DDX1 in the chemosensitivity of NSCLC cells and the underlying mechanisms were determined using colony formation, CCK-8, flow cytometry, wound healing, Transwell, tumor sphere formation, and immunostaining assays, together with a xenograft tumor model in nude mice. KEY FINDINGS: Our study revealed that DDX1 was overexpressed in NSCLC cell lines and tissues. We further found that depleting DDX1 increased the sensitivity of NSCLC cells to the chemotherapy drug cisplatin, increased cell apoptosis, and inhibited cell migration and invasion. Co-immunoprecipitation assays revealed that DDX1 bound to ADAR1, and increased ADAR1 protein expression. Furthermore, we found that ADAR1 mediated cancer-promoting effects, independent of deaminase activity, by binding to RAC3 mRNA. Our findings not only show that DDX1 mediates chemosensitivity to cisplatin via the ADAR1/RAC3 axis but also highlight the importance of ADARs as essential RNA-binding proteins for cell homeostasis, as well as cancer progression.

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a group of endogenous RNAs considered essential regulatory factor in BC tumorigenesis and progression. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of circRNAs remain unclear. METHODS: Expression levels of circPAPD4, miR-1269a, CREBZF, and ADAR1 in BC cell lines and tissues were measured using bioinformatics analysis, RT-qPCR, ISH, and IHC. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were measured using CCK8, EdU staining, flow cytometry, and TUNEL assays. Pearson correlation analysis, RNA pull-down, dual-luciferase reporter, and co-immunoprecipitation assays were used to explore the correlation among circPAPD4, miR-1269a, CREBZF, STAT3, and ADAR1. Effects of circPAPD4 overexpression on tumor progression were investigated using in vivo assays. Moreover, CREBZF mRNA delivered by polymeric nanoparticles (CREBZF-mRNA-NPs) was used to examine application value of our findings. RESULTS: CircPAPD4 expression was low in BC tissues and cells. Functionally, circPAPD4 inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, circPAPD4 biogenesis was regulated by ADAR1. And circPAPD4 promoted CREBZF expression by competitively binding to miR-1269a. More importantly, CREBZF promoted circPAPD4 expression by suppressing STAT3 dimerization and ADAR1 expression, revealing a novel positive feedback loop that curbed BC progression. Systematic delivery of CREBZF-mRNA-NPs effectively induced CREBZF expression and activated the positive feedback loop of circPAPD4/miR-1269a/CREBZF/STAT3/ADAR1, which might suppress BC progression in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSION: Our findings firstly illustrated that circPAPD4/miR-1269a/CREBZF/STAT3/ADAR1 positive feedback loop mediated BC progression, and delivering CREBZF mRNA nanoparticles suppressed BC progression in vitro and in vivo, which might provide novel insights into therapeutic strategies for breast cancer.",2023 Jun 1,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2023 Jun 1;42(1):138. doi: 10.1186/s13046-023-02701-5.,"['Zhou B', 'Xue J', 'Wu R', 'Meng H', 'Li R', 'Mo Z', 'Zhai H', 'Chen X', 'Liu R', 'Lai G', 'Chen X', 'Li T', 'Zheng S']",True
37279397,Meta-Analysis of Keratoconus Transcriptomic Data Revealed Altered RNA Editing Levels Impacting Keratin Genomic Clusters.,"INTRODUCTION: Keratoconus (KC) is an ocular disorder with a multifactorial origin. Transcriptomic analyses (RNA-seq) revealed deregulations of coding (mRNA) and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in KC, suggesting that mRNA-ncRNA co-regulations can promote the onset of KC. The present study investigates the modulation of RNA editing mediated by the adenosine deaminase acting on dsRNA (ADAR) enzyme in KC. MATERIALS: The level of ADAR-mediated RNA editing in KC and healthy corneas were determined by two indexes in two different sequencing datasets. REDIportal was used to localize known editing sites, whereas new putative sites were de novo identified in the most extended dataset only and their possible impact was evaluated. Western Blot analysis was used to measure the level of ADAR1 in the cornea from independent samples. RESULTS: KC was characterized by a statistically significant lower RNA-editing level compared to controls, resulting in a lower editing frequency, and less edited bases. The distribution of the editing sites along the human genome showed considerable differences between groups, particularly relevant in the chromosome 12 regions encoding for Keratin type II cluster. A total of 32 recoding sites were characterized, 17 representing novel sites. JUP, KRT17, KRT76, and KRT79 were edited with higher frequencies in KC than in controls, whereas BLCAP, COG3, KRT1, KRT75, and RRNAD1 were less edited. Both gene expression and protein levels of ADAR1 appeared not regulated between diseased and controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrated an altered RNA-editing in KC possibly linked to the peculiar cellular conditions. The functional implications should be further investigated.",2023 Jun 1,Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci. 2023 Jun 1;64(7):12. doi: 10.1167/iovs.64.7.12.,"['Bortoletto E', 'Pieretti F', 'Brun P', 'Venier P', 'Leonardi A', 'Rosani U']",True
36822494,Folate metabolism negatively regulates OAS-mediated antiviral innate immunity via ADAR3/endogenous dsRNA pathway.,"BACKGROUND: Folate (FA) is an essential cofactor in the one-carbon (1C) metabolic pathway and participates in amino acid metabolism, purine and thymidylate synthesis, and DNA methylation. FA metabolism has been reported to play an important role in viral replications; however, the roles of FA metabolism in the antiviral innate immune response are unclear. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the potential regulatory role of FA metabolism in antiviral innate immune response, we establish the model of FA deficiency (FAD) in vitro and in vivo. The molecular and functional effects of FAD on 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetases (OAS)-associated antiviral innate immunity pathways were assessed; and the potential relationship between FA metabolism and the axis of adenosine deaminases acting on RNA 3 (ADAR3)/endogenous double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)/OAS was further explored in the present study, as well as the potential translatability of these findings in vivo. METHODS: FA-free RPMI 1640 medium and FA-free feed were used to establish the model of FAD in vitro and in vivo. And FA and homocysteine (Hcy) concentrations in cell culture supernatants and serum were used for FAD model evaluation. Ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation assay was used to enrich endogenous dsRNA, and dot-blot was further used for quantitative analysis of endogenous dsRNA. Western-blot assay, RNA isolation and quantitative real-time PCR, immunofluorescence assay, and other molecular biology techniques were used for exploring the potential mechanisms. RESULTS: In this study, we observed that FA metabolism negatively regulated OAS-mediated antiviral innate immune response. Mechanistically, FAD induced ADAR3, which interacted with endogenous dsRNA, to inhibit deaminated adenosine (A) being converted into inosine (I), leading to the cytoplasmic accumulation of dsRNA. Furthermore, endogenous dsRNA accumulated in cytoplasm triggered the host immune activation, thus promoting the expression of OAS2 to suppress the replication of viruses. Additionally, injection of 8-Azaadenosine to experimental animals, an A-to-I editing inhibitor, efficiently enhanced OAS-mediated antiviral innate immune response to reduce the viral burden in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our present study provided a new perspective to illustrate a relationship between FA metabolism and the axis of ADAR3/endogenous dsRNA/OAS, and a new insight for the treatment of RNA viral infectious diseases by targeting the axis of ADAR3/endogenous dsRNA/OAS.",2023 Jun,Metabolism. 2023 Jun;143:155526. doi: 10.1016/j.metabol.2023.155526.

37254821,Histone mRNA polyadenylation-mediated inflammation underlies various virus infections and cancers.,"The mechanistic understanding of virus infection and inflammation in many diseases is incomplete. Normally, messenger RNA (mRNA) tails of replication-dependent histones (RDH) that safeguard naked nuclear DNAs are protected by a specialized stem-loop instead of polyadenylation. Here, we showed that infection by various RNA viruses (including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) induced aberrant polyadenylation of RDH mRNAs (pARDH) that resulted in inflammation or cellular senescence, based on which we constructed a pARDH inflammation score (pARIS). We further investigated pARIS elevation in various disease conditions, including different types of virus infection, cancer, and cellular senescence. Notably, we found that pARIS was positively correlated with coronavirus disease 2019 severity in specific immune cell types. We also detected a subset of HIV-1 elite controllers characterized by pARDH ""flipping"" potentially mediated by HuR. Importantly, pARIS was positively associated with transcription of endogenous retrovirus but negatively associated with most immune cell infiltration in tumors of various cancer types. Finally, we identified and experimentally verified two pARIS regulators, ADAR1 and ZKSCAN1, which was first linked to inflammation. The ZKSCAN1 was known as a transcription factor but instead was shown to regulate pARIS as a novel RNA binding protein. Both regulators were upregulated under most infection and inflammation conditions. In conclusion, we unraveled a potential antiviral mechanism underlying various types of virus infections and cancers.",2023 Jun,J Med Virol. 2023 Jun;95(6):e28826. doi: 10.1002/jmv.28826.,"['Guo M', 'Zhu J', 'Hu Z', 'Wang Q', 'Songyang Z', 'Xiong Y']",True
37275274,Over-expression of ADAR1 in mice does not initiate or accelerate cancer formation in vivo.,"Adenosine to inosine editing (A-to-I) in regions of double stranded RNA (dsRNA) is mediated by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) or ADAR2. ADAR1 and A-to-I editing levels are increased in many human cancers. Inhibition of ADAR1 has emerged as a high priority oncology target, however, whether ADAR1 overexpression enables cancer initiation or progression has not been directly tested. We established a series of in vivo models to allow overexpression of full-length ADAR1, or its individual isoforms, to test if increased ADAR1 expression was oncogenic. Widespread over-expression of ADAR1 or the p110 or p150 isoforms individually as sole lesions was well tolerated and did not result in cancer initiation. Therefore, ADAR1 overexpression alone is not sufficient to initiate cancer. We demonstrate that endogenous ADAR1 and A-to-I editing increased upon immortalization in murine cells, consistent with the observations from human cancers. We tested if ADAR1 over-expression could co-operate with cancer initiated by loss of tumour suppressors using a model of osteosarcoma. We did not see a disease potentiating or modifying effect of overexpressing ADAR1 or its isoforms in the models assessed. We conclude that increased ADAR1 expression and A-to-I editing in cancers is most likely a consequence of tumor formation.",2023 Jun,NAR Cancer. 2023 Jun 1;5(2):zcad023. doi: 10.1093/narcan/zcad023. eCollection 2023 Jun.,"['Mendez Ruiz S', 'Chalk AM', 'Goradia A', 'Heraud-Farlow J', 'Walkley CR']",True
37093306,Acid-tolerant bacteria and prospects in industrial and environmental applications.,"Acid-tolerant bacteria such as Streptococcus mutans, Acidobacterium capsulatum, Escherichia coli, and Propionibacterium acidipropionici have developed several survival mechanisms to sustain themselves in various acid stress conditions. Some bacteria survive by minor changes in the environmental pH. In contrast, few others adapt different acid tolerance mechanisms, including amino acid decarboxylase acid resistance systems, mainly glutamate-dependent acid resistance (GDAR) and arginine-dependent acid resistance (ADAR) systems. The cellular mechanisms of acid tolerance include cell membrane alteration in Acidithiobacillus thioxidans, proton elimination by F(1)-F(0)-ATPase in Streptococcus pyogenes, biofilm formation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, cytoplasmic urease activity in Streptococcus mutans, synthesis of the protective cloud of ammonia, and protection or repair of macromolecules in Bacillus caldontenax. Apart from cellular mechanisms, there are several acid-tolerant genes such as gadA, gadB, adiA, adiC, cadA, cadB, cadC, speF, and potE that help the bacteria to tolerate the acidic environment. This acid tolerance behavior provides new and broad prospects for different industrial applications and the bioremediation of environmental pollutants. The development of engineered strains with acid-tolerant genes may improve the efficiency of the transgenic bacteria in the treatment of acidic industrial effluents.

Recent study has shown that small noncoding RNAs (DDRNAs) and/or newly RNAPII transcribed RNAs (dilncRNAs) are orchestrating the initial steps of double-strand break (DSB) repair. In this study, we demonstrate that also pre-mRNA could be used as direct or indirect substrate for DSB repair. Our test system is based on (1) a stably integrated mutant reporter gene that produces constitutively a nonspliceable pre-mRNA, (2) a transiently expressed sgRNA-guided dCas13b::ADAR fusion protein to specifically RNA edit the nonspliceable pre-mRNA, and (3) transiently expressed I-SceI to create a DSB situation to study the effect of spliceable pre-mRNA on DNA repair. Based on our data, the RNA-edited pre-mRNA was used in cis for the DSB repair process, thereby converting the genomically encoded mutant reporter gene into an active reporter gene.

36620962,RNA editing: Expanding the potential of RNA therapeutics.,"RNA therapeutics have had a tremendous impact on medicine, recently exemplified by the rapid development and deployment of mRNA vaccines to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, RNA-targeting drugs have been developed for diseases with significant unmet medical needs through selective mRNA knockdown or modulation of pre-mRNA splicing. Recently, RNA editing, particularly antisense RNA-guided adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR)-based programmable A-to-I editing, has emerged as a powerful tool to manipulate RNA to enable correction of disease-causing mutations and modulate gene expression and protein function. Beyond correcting pathogenic mutations, the technology is particularly well suited for therapeutic applications that require a transient pharmacodynamic effect, such as the treatment of acute pain, obesity, viral infection, and inflammation, where it would be undesirable to introduce permanent alterations to the genome. Furthermore, transient modulation of protein function, such as altering the active sites of enzymes or the interface of protein-protein interactions, opens the door to therapeutic avenues ranging from regenerative medicine to oncology. These emerging RNA-editing-based toolsets are poised to broadly impact biotechnology and therapeutic applications.

Here, we attempted to identify common and unique gene dependencies and their associated biomarkers among adult and pediatric tumor isolates using functional genetic lethal screens and computational modeling. METHODS: We performed CRISRP-Cas9 lethality screens in two adult glioblastoma (GBM) tumor isolates and five pediatric brain tumor isolates representing atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors (ATRT), diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma, GBM, and medulloblastoma. We then integrated the screen results with machine learning-based gene-dependency models generated from data from >900 cancer cell lines. RESULTS: We found that >50% of candidate dependencies of 280 identified were shared between adult GBM tumors and individual pediatric tumor isolates. 68% of screen hits were found as nodes in our network models, along with shared and tumor-specific predictors of gene dependencies. We investigated network predictors associated with ADAR, EFR3A, FGFR1 (pediatric-specific), and SMARCC2 (ATRT-specific) gene dependency among our tumor isolates. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that, despite harboring disparate genomic signatures, adult and pediatric tumor isolates share a preponderance of genetic dependences. Further, combining data from primary brain tumor lethality screens with large cancer cell line datasets produced valuable insights into biomarkers of gene dependency, even for rare cancers. IMPORTANCE OF THE STUDY: Our results demonstrate that large cancer cell lines data sets can be computationally mined to identify known and novel gene dependency relationships in adult and pediatric human brain tumor isolates.

36685257,Nucleoside analogs in ADAR guide strands targeting 5'-UA̲ sites.,"Adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADARs) can be directed to predetermined sites in transcriptomes by forming duplex structures with exogenously delivered guide RNAs (gRNAs). They can then catalyze the hydrolytic deamination of adenosine to inosine in double stranded RNA, which is read as guanosine during translation. High resolution structures of ADAR2-RNA complexes revealed a unique conformation for the nucleotide in the guide strand base paired to the editing site's 5' nearest neighbor (-1 position). Here we describe the effect of 16 different nucleoside analogs at this position in a gRNA that targets a 5'-UA̲-3' site. We found that several analogs increase editing efficiency for both catalytically active human ADARs. In particular, 2'-deoxynebularine (dN) increased the ADAR1 and ADAR2 in vitro deamination rates when at the -1 position of gRNAs targeting the human MECP2 W104X site, the mouse IDUA W392X site, and a site in the 3'-UTR of human ACTB. Furthermore, a locked nucleic acid (LNA) modification at the -1 position was found to eliminate editing. When placed -1 to a bystander editing site in the MECP2 W104X sequence, bystander editing was eliminated while maintaining on-target editing. In vitro trends for four -1 nucleoside analogs were validated by directed editing of the MECP2 W104X site expressed on a reporter transcript in human cells. This work demonstrates the importance of the -1 position of the gRNA to ADAR editing and discloses nucleoside analogs for this site that modulate ADAR editing efficiency.",2023 Jan 4,RSC Chem Biol. 2022 Oct 31;4(1):74-83. doi: 10.1039/d2cb00165a. eCollection 2023 Jan 4.,"['Brinkman HF', 'Jauregui Matos V', 'Mendoza HG', 'Doherty EE', 'Beal PA']",True

Antigen-presenting cells (APCs) sense pathogen-associated molecular patterns, such as dsRNA, to activate the immune response. The impact of ADAR1 on the function of APCs and the consequences to immunity are poorly understood. Here, we show that ADAR1 deletion in CD11c+ APCs leads to (1) a skewed myeloid cell compartment enriched in inflammatory cDC2-like cells, (2) enhanced numbers of activated tissue resident memory T cells in the lung, and (3) the imprinting of a broad antiviral transcriptional signature across both immune and non-immune cells.

36130731,A fish herpesvirus highlights functional diversities among Zα domains related to phase separation induction and A-to-Z conversion.,"Zalpha (Zα) domains bind to left-handed Z-DNA and Z-RNA. The Zα domain protein family includes cellular (ADAR1, ZBP1 and PKZ) and viral (vaccinia virus E3 and cyprinid herpesvirus 3 (CyHV-3) ORF112) proteins. We studied CyHV-3 ORF112, which contains an intrinsically disordered region and a Zα domain. Genome editing of CyHV-3 indicated that the expression of only the Zα domain of ORF112 was sufficient for normal viral replication in cell culture and virulence in carp. In contrast, its deletion was lethal for the virus. These observations revealed the potential of the CyHV-3 model as a unique platform to compare the exchangeability of Zα domains expressed alone in living cells. Attempts to rescue the ORF112 deletion by a broad spectrum of cellular, viral, and artificial Zα domains showed that only those expressing Z-binding activity, the capacity to induce liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), and A-to-Z conversion, could rescue viral replication. For the first time, this study reports the ability of some Zα domains to induce LLPS and supports the biological relevance of dsRNA A-to-Z conversion mediated by Zα domains.

36747811,ADAR1p150 Prevents MDA5 and PKR Activation via Distinct Mechanisms to Avert Fatal Autoinflammation.,"Effective immunity requires the innate immune system to distinguish foreign (non-self) nucleic acids from cellular (self) nucleic acids. Cellular double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) are edited by the RNA editing enzyme ADAR1 to prevent their dsRNA structure pattern being recognized as viral dsRNA by cytoplasmic dsRNA sensors including MDA5, PKR and ZBP1. A loss of ADAR1-mediated RNA editing of cellular dsRNA activates MDA5. However, additional RNA editing-independent functions of ADAR1 have been proposed, but a specific mechanism has not been delineated. We now demonstrate that the loss of ADAR1-mediated RNA editing specifically activates MDA5, while loss of the cytoplasmic ADAR1p150 isoform or its dsRNA binding activity enabled PKR activation. Deleting both MDA5 and PKR resulted in complete rescue of the embryonic lethality of Adar1p150 (-/-) mice to adulthood, contrasting with the limited or no rescue by removing MDA5, PKR or ZBP1 alone, demonstrating that this is a species conserved function of ADAR1p150.

36683360,Enhanced mitophagy driven by ADAR1-GLI1 editing supports the self-renewal of cancer stem cells in hepatocellular carcinoma.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Deregulation of adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) leads to tumor-specific transcriptome diversity with prognostic values for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, ADAR1 editase-dependent mechanisms governing liver cancer stem cell (LCSC) generation and maintenance have remained elusive. APPROACH AND RESULTS: RNA-seq profiling identified ADAR1-responsive recoding editing events in HCC and showed editing frequency of GLI1 rather than transcript abundance, was clinically relevant. Functional differences in LCSC self-renewal and tumor aggressiveness between wild-type (GLI1 wt ) and edited GLI1 (GLI1 R701G ) were elucidated. We showed that overediting of GLI1 induced an arginine-to-glycine (R701G) substitution, augmenting tumor-initiating potential and exhibiting a more aggressive phenotype. GLI1 R701G harbored weak affinity to SUFU; which in turn, promoted its cytoplasmic-to-nuclear translocation to support LCSC self-renewal by increased pluripotency gene expression. Moreover, editing predisposes to stabilized GLI1 by abrogating β-TrCP-GLI1 interaction. Integrative analysis of single-cell transcriptome further revealed hyperactivated mitophagy in ADAR1-enriched LCSCs. GLI1 editing promoted a metabolic switch to oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to control stress and stem-like state via PINK1-Parkin-mediated mitophagy in HCC, thereby conferring exclusive metastatic and sorafenib-resistant capacities.

36527980,Pathological features of glial cells and motor neurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord in sporadic ALS using ADAR2 conditional knockout mice.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by the selective degeneration of motor neurons (MNs). In the MNs of patients with ALS, adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 2 (ADAR2)-mediated RNA editing of GluA2 mRNA at the Q/R site is profoundly deficient. In genetically modified mice (ADAR2(flox/flox)/VAChT-Cre.Fast; AR2), the selective knockout of ADAR2 in cholinergic neurons induced progressive loss of lower MNs. MNs exhibiting an age-related increase in abnormal TDP-43 localization and reduced ADAR2 immunoreactivity are localized in the lateral areas of the anterior horns (AHs) in aged wild-type mice. However, the patterns in the AHs of AR2 mice remain unknown. In this study, we investigated whether similar degeneration is observed in AR2 mice. We compared the number of astrocytes and MNs in the lateral and medial AHs of the lumbar spinal cord of 12-month-old AR2 mice with age-matched wild-type mice. The number of MNs significantly decreased in both the lateral and medial areas in AR2 mice AHs, particularly in the former. The number of reactive astrocytes increased significantly in the lateral areas of the AHs of AR2 mice. In conclusion, stronger activation of astrocytes with reduction of MNs in the ADAR2 deficiency-related lateral area increases in AR2 mice AHs. Fast fatigable MNs are expected to be present in the lateral area of the AHs. We found that MN death is more common in the lateral area of AHs associated with FF MNs due to differences in vulnerability to MN under ADAR2 deficiency.",2023 Jan 15,J Neurol Sci. 2023 Jan 15;444:120520. doi: 10.1016/j.jns.2022.120520.

36458554,Adar1 deletion causes degeneration of the exocrine pancreas via Mavs-dependent interferon signaling.,"Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) is an RNA-binding protein that deaminates adenosine (A) to inosine (I). A-to-I editing alters post-transcriptional RNA processing, making ADAR1 a crucial regulator of gene expression. Consequently, Adar1 has been implicated in organogenesis. To determine the role of Adar1 in pancreatic development and homeostasis, we conditionally deleted Adar1 from the murine pancreas (Ptf1aCre/+; Adar1Fl/Fl). The resulting mice had stunted growth, likely due to malabsorption associated with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Analyses of pancreata revealed ductal cell expansion, heightened interferon-stimulated gene expression and an increased influx of immune cells. Concurrent deletion of Adar1 and Mavs, a signaling protein implicated in the innate immune pathway, rescued the degenerative phenotype and resulted in normal pancreatic development.

36305508,The allelic regulation of tumor suppressor ADARB2 in papillary thyroid carcinoma.,"Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is one of the histological subtypes of thyroid cancer which is the most common endocrine malignancy in the world. The disrupted balance of the adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing due to dysregulation of the editing genes exists in thyroid cancer. However, it is still largely unknown how functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the A-to-I RNA editing genes contribute to PTC genetic susceptibility. In this study, we systematically annotated and investigated the role of 28 potential functional SNPs of ADAR, ADARB1, ADARB2 and AIMP2 in PTC. We identified ADARB2 rs904957 and rs1007147 genetic variants which are associated with significantly elevated PTC risk in two case-control sets consisting of 2020 PTC cases and 2021 controls. Further investigations disclosed that ADARB2 could inhibit cell viability and invasion capabilities of PTC cells as a novel tumor suppressor. The ADARB2 rs904957 thymine-to-cytosine (T-to-C) polymorphism in gene 3'-untranslated region enhances miR-1180-3p-binding affinity and represses ADARB2 expression through an allele-specific manner. In line with this, carriers with the rs904957 C allele correlated with decreased tumor suppressor ADARB2 expression in tissue specimens showed notably increased risk of developing PTC compared to the T allele carriers. Our findings highlight that the A-to-I RNA editing gene ADARB2 SNPs confer PTC risk. Importantly, these insights would improve our understanding for the general roles of RNA editing and editing genes during cancer development.",2023 Jan 1,Endocr Relat Cancer. 2022 Dec 13;30(1):e220189. doi: 10.1530/ERC-22-0189.

A rapid review process was utilized to identify literature documenting system and policy level barriers and opportunities to address oral health equity issues for older adults in the United States. Twenty-five articles met inclusion criteria for analysis. Findings revealed four barrier and three opportunity themes. Recommendations of analysis include expansion of oral health coverage under Medicare and Medicaid along with community-based and co-located medical and dental services. This will address access and utilization barriers and provide education for older adults, health providers, and the general population.

36599932,ADAR1-dependent miR-3144-3p editing simultaneously induces MSI2 expression and suppresses SLC38A4 expression in liver cancer.,"Aberrant adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing, catalyzed by adenosine deaminase acting on double-stranded RNA (ADAR), has been implicated in various cancers, but the mechanisms by which microRNA (miRNA) editing contributes to cancer development are largely unknown. Our multistage hepatocellular carcinogenesis transcriptome data analyses, together with publicly available data, indicated that ADAR1 was the most profoundly dysregulated gene among RNA-editing enzyme family members in liver cancer. Targeted inactivation of ADAR1 inhibited the in vitro tumorigenesis of liver cancer cells. An integrative computational analyses of RNA-edited hotspots and the known editing frequency of miRNAs suggested that the miRNA miR-3144-3p was edited by ADAR1 during liver cancer progression. Specifically, ADAR1 promoted A-to-I editing of canonical miR-3144-3p to replace the adenosine at Position 3 in the seed region with a guanine (ED_miR-3144-3p(3_A < G)) in liver cancer cells. We then demonstrated that Musashi RNA-binding protein 2 (MSI2) was a specific target of miR-3144-3p and that MSI2 overexpression was due to excessive ADAR1-dependent over-editing of canonical miR-3144-3p in liver cancer. In addition, target prediction analyses and validation experiments identified solute carrier family 38 member 4 (SLC38A4) as a specific gene target of ED_miR-3144-3p(3_A < G). The ectopic expression of both ADAR1 and the ED_miR-3144-3p(3_A < G) mimic enhanced mitotic activities, and ADAR1 suppressed SLC38A4 expression in liver cancer cells. Treatments with mouse-specific ADAR1-, MSI2-siRNA-, or SLC38A4-expressing plasmids suppressed tumorigenesis and tumor growth in a mouse model of spontaneous liver cancer. Our findings suggest that the aberrant regulation of ADAR1 augments oncogenic MSI2 effects by excessively editing canonical miR-3144-3p and that the resultant ED_miR-3144-3p(3_A < G) simultaneously suppresses tumor suppressor SLC38A4 expression, contributing to hepatocellular carcinogenesis.",2023 Jan,Exp Mol Med. 2023 Jan;55(1):95-107. doi: 10.1038/s12276-022-00916-8.

It has been discovered recently as an epigenetic modification dysregulated in human cancers. However, the clinical significance of RNA editing in patients with liver metastasis from colorectal cancer (CRC) remains unclear. The current study aimed to systematically and comprehensively investigate the significance of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) expression status in 83 liver metastatic tissue samples collected from 36 patients with CRC. The ADAR1 expression level was significantly elevated in liver metastatic tissue samples obtained from patients with right-sided, synchronous, or RAS mutant-type CRC. ADAR1-high liver metastasis was significantly correlated with remnant liver recurrence after hepatic metastasectomy. A high ADAR1 expression was a predictive factor of remnant liver recurrence (area under the curve = 0.72). Results showed that the ADAR1 expression level could be a clinically relevant predictive indicator of remnant liver recurrence.

36834591,FUS Alters circRNA Metabolism in Human Motor Neurons Carrying the ALS-Linked P525L Mutation.,"Deregulation of RNA metabolism has emerged as one of the key events leading to the degeneration of motor neurons (MNs) in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) disease. Indeed, mutations on RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) or on proteins involved in aspects of RNA metabolism account for the majority of familiar forms of ALS. In particular, the impact of the ALS-linked mutations of the RBP FUS on many aspects of RNA-related processes has been vastly investigated. FUS plays a pivotal role in splicing regulation and its mutations severely alter the exon composition of transcripts coding for proteins involved in neurogenesis, axon guidance, and synaptic activity. In this study, by using in vitro-derived human MNs, we investigate the effect of the P525L FUS mutation on non-canonical splicing events that leads to the formation of circular RNAs (circRNAs). We observed altered levels of circRNAs in FUS(P525L) MNs and a preferential binding of the mutant protein to introns flanking downregulated circRNAs and containing inverted Alu repeats. For a subset of circRNAs, FUS(P525L) also impacts their nuclear/cytoplasmic partitioning, confirming its involvement in different processes of RNA metabolism. Finally, we assess the potential of cytoplasmic circRNAs to act as miRNA sponges, with possible implications in ALS pathogenesis.",2023 Feb 6,Int J Mol Sci. 2023 Feb 6;24(4):3181. doi: 10.3390/ijms24043181.,"['Colantoni A', 'Capauto D', 'Alfano V', ""D'Ambra E"", ""D'Uva S"", 'Tartaglia GG', 'Morlando M']",False
36834609,RNA Helicase DDX6 Regulates A-to-I Editing and Neuronal Differentiation in Human Cells.,"The DEAD-box proteins, one family of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), participate in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression with multiple aspects. Among them, DDX6 is an essential component of the cytoplasmic RNA processing body (P-body) and is involved in translational repression, miRNA-meditated gene silencing, and RNA decay. In addition to the cytoplasmic function, DDX6 is also present in the nucleus, but the nuclear function remains unknown. To decipher the potential role of DDX6 in the nucleus, we performed mass spectrometry analysis of immunoprecipitated DDX6 from a HeLa nuclear extract. We found that adenosine deaminases that act on RNA 1 (ADAR1) interact with DDX6 in the nucleus. Utilizing our newly developed dual-fluorescence reporter assay, we elucidated the DDX6 function as negative regulators in cellular ADAR1p110 and ADAR2. In addition, depletion of DDX6 and ADARs results in the opposite effect on facilitation of RA-induced differentiation of neuronal lineage cells. Our data suggest the impact of DDX6 in regulation of the cellular RNA editing level, thus contributing to differentiation in the neuronal cell model.",2023 Feb 6,Int J Mol Sci. 2023 Feb 6;24(4):3197. doi: 10.3390/ijms24043197.,"['Shih CY', 'Chen YC', 'Lin HY', 'Chu CY']",False

Three cases were randomly selected in IFN-responding CHB patients (Rs), non-responding CHB patients (NRs) and healthy participants, respectively. The human type I IFN response RT (2) profiler PCR array was used to detect the expression levels of IFN-related genes in peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs) from healthy participants and CHB patients before and after Peg-IFN-α 2a treatment. The results showed that more differentially expressed genes appeared in Rs group than NRs group after IFN treatment. Comparing with healthy participants, IFNG, IL7R, IRF1, and IRF8 were downregulated in both Rs and NRs group before IFN treatment; CXCL10, IFIT1, and IFITM1 were upregulated in the Rs; IL13RA1 and IFI35 were upregulated in the NRs, while IFRD2, IL11RA, IL4R, IRF3, IRF4, PYHIN1, and ADAR were downregulated. The expression of IL15, IFI35 and IFI44 was downregulated by 4.09 ( t = 10.58, P < 0.001), 5.59 ( t = 3.37, P = 0.028) and 10.83 ( t = 2.8, P = 0.049) fold in the Rs group compared with the NRs group, respectively. In conclusion, IFN-response-related gene array is able to evaluate IFN treatment response by detecting IFN-related genes levels in PBMC.

36688311,ADAR1 Non-Editing Function in Macrophage Activation and Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm.,"BACKGROUND: Macrophage activation plays a critical role in abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) development. However, molecular mechanisms controlling macrophage activation and vascular inflammation in AAA remain largely unknown. The objective of the study was to identify novel mechanisms underlying adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR1) function in macrophage activation and AAA formation. METHODS: Aortic transplantation was conducted to determine the importance of nonvascular ADAR1 in AAA development/dissection. Ang II (Angiotensin II) infusion of ApoE-/- mouse model combined with macrophage-specific knockout of ADAR1 was used to study ADAR1 macrophage-specific role in AAA formation/dissection. The relevance of macrophage ADAR1 to human AAA was examined using human aneurysm specimens. Moreover, a novel humanized AAA model was established to test the role of human macrophages in aneurysm formation in human arteries. RESULTS: Allograft transplantation of wild-type abdominal aortas to ADAR1+/- recipient mice significantly attenuated AAA formation, suggesting that nonvascular ADAR1 is essential for AAA development. ADAR1 deficiency in hematopoietic cells decreased the prevalence and severity of AAA while inhibited macrophage infiltration and aorta wall inflammation. ADAR1 deletion blocked the classic macrophage activation, diminished NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa B) signaling, and enhanced the expression of a number of anti-inflammatory microRNAs. Mechanistically, ADAR1 interacted with Drosha to promote its degradation, which attenuated Drosha-DGCR8 (DiGeorge syndrome critical region 8) interaction, and consequently inhibited pri- to pre-microRNA processing of microRNAs targeting IKKβ, resulting in an increased IKKβ (inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B) expression and enhanced NF-κB signaling. Significantly, ADAR1 was induced in macrophages and interacted with Drosha in human AAA lesions. Reconstitution of ADAR1-deficient, but not the wild type, human monocytes to immunodeficient mice blocked the aneurysm formation in transplanted human arteries. CONCLUSIONS: Macrophage ADAR1 promotes aneurysm formation in both mouse and human arteries through a novel mechanism, that is, Drosha protein degradation, which inhibits the processing of microRNAs targeting NF-kB signaling and thus elicits macrophage-mediated vascular inflammation in AAA.",2023 Feb 17,Circ Res. 2023 Feb 17;132(4):e78-e93. doi: 10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.122.321722.

However, other than chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) blast crisis, relatively little is known about its role in other types of hematological malignancies. Here, we found that ADAR2, but not ADAR1 and ADAR3, was specifically downregulated in the core binding factor (CBF) AML with t(8;21) or inv(16) translocations. In t(8;21) AML, RUNX1-driven transcription of ADAR2 was repressed by the RUNX1-ETO AE9a fusion protein in a dominant negative manner. Further functional studies confirmed that ADAR2 could suppress leukemogenesis specifically in t(8;21) and inv16 AML cells dependent on its RNA editing capability. Expression of two exemplary ADAR2-regulated RNA editing targets COPA and COG3 inhibited clonogenic growth of human t(8;21) AML cells. Our findings support a hitherto unappreciated mechanism leading to ADAR2 dysregulation in CBF AML and highlight the functional relevance of loss of ADAR2-mediated RNA editing to CBF AML.",2023 Feb 16,Blood. 2023 Feb 16:blood.2022015830. doi: 10.1182/blood.2022015830.,"['Guo M', 'Chan HMT', 'Zhou QL', 'An O', 'Li Y', 'Song Y', 'Tan ZH', 'Ng HEV', 'Peramangalam PS', 'Tan ZQ', 'Cao X', 'Iwanaga E', 'Matsuoka M', 'Ooi MG', 'Jen WY', 'Koh LP', 'Chan E', 'Tan LK', 'Goh Y', 'Wang W', 'Koh BTH', 'Chan MC', 'Fullwood MJ', 'Chng WJ', 'Osato M', 'Pulikkan JA', 'Yang H', 'Chen L', 'Tenen DG']",True
36790891,Extensive Recoding of the Neural Proteome in Cephalopods by RNA Editing.,"The coleoid cephalopods have the largest brains, and display the most complex behaviors, of all invertebrates. The molecular and cellular mechanisms that underlie these remarkable advancements remain largely unexplored. Early molecular cloning studies of squid ion channel transcripts uncovered an unusually large number of A→I RNA editing sites that recoded codons. Further cloning of other neural transcripts showed a similar pattern. The advent of deep-sequencing technologies and the associated bioinformatics allowed the mapping of RNA editing events across the entire neural transcriptomes of various cephalopods. The results were remarkable: They contained orders of magnitude more recoding editing sites than any other taxon. Although RNA editing sites are abundant in most multicellular metazoans, they rarely recode. In cephalopods, the majority of neural transcripts are recoded.

36781883,APOBEC3B drives PKR-mediated translation shutdown and protects stress granules in response to viral infection.,"Double-stranded RNA produced during viral replication and transcription activates both protein kinase R (PKR) and ribonuclease L (RNase L), which limits viral gene expression and replication through host shutoff of translation. In this study, we find that APOBEC3B forms a complex with PABPC1 to stimulate PKR and counterbalances the PKR-suppressing activity of ADAR1 in response to infection by many types of viruses. This leads to translational blockage and the formation of stress granules. Furthermore, we show that APOBEC3B localizes to stress granules through the interaction with PABPC1. APOBEC3B facilitates the formation of protein-RNA condensates with stress granule assembly factor (G3BP1) by protecting mRNA associated with stress granules from RNAse L-induced RNA cleavage during viral infection. These results not only reveal that APOBEC3B is a key regulator of different steps of the innate immune response throughout viral infection but also highlight an alternative mechanism by which APOBEC3B can impact virus replication without editing viral genomes.",2023 Feb 14,Nat Commun. 2023 Feb 14;14(1):820. doi: 10.1038/s41467-023-36445-9.,"['Manjunath L', 'Oh S', 'Ortega P', 'Bouin A', 'Bournique E', 'Sanchez A', 'Martensen PM', 'Auerbach AA', 'Becker JT', 'Seldin M', 'Harris RS', 'Semler BL', 'Buisson R']",False
36795564,On the origin and evolution of RNA editing in metazoans.,"Extensive adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing of nuclear-transcribed mRNAs is the hallmark of metazoan transcriptional regulation. Here, by profiling the RNA editomes of 22 species that cover major groups of Holozoa, we provide substantial evidence supporting A-to-I mRNA editing as a regulatory innovation originating in the last common ancestor of extant metazoans. This ancient biochemistry process is preserved in most extant metazoan phyla and primarily targets endogenous double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) formed by evolutionarily young repeats. We also find intermolecular pairing of sense-antisense transcripts as an important mechanism for forming dsRNA substrates for A-to-I editing in some but not all lineages. Likewise, recoding editing is rarely shared across lineages but preferentially targets genes involved in neural and cytoskeleton systems in bilaterians. We conclude that metazoan A-to-I editing might first emerge as a safeguard mechanism against repeat-derived dsRNA and was later co-opted into diverse biological processes due to its mutagenic nature.",2023 Feb 14,Cell Rep. 2023 Feb 14;42(2):112112. doi: 10.1016/j.celrep.2023.112112.,"['Zhang P', 'Zhu Y', 'Guo Q', 'Li J', 'Zhan X', 'Yu H', 'Xie N', 'Tan H', 'Lundholm N', 'Garcia-Cuetos L', 'Martin MD', 'Subirats MA', 'Su YH', 'Ruiz-Trillo I', 'Martindale MQ', 'Yu JK', 'Gilbert MTP', 'Zhang G', 'Li Q']",True
36765416,Integrated analysis of RNA methylation regulators crosstalk and immune infiltration for predictive and personalized therapy of diabetic nephropathy.,"BACKGROUND: RNA methylation is a widely known post-transcriptional regulation which exists in many cancer and immune system diseases. However, the potential role and crosstalk of five types RNA methylation regulators in diabetic nephropathy (DN) and immune microenvironment remain unclear. METHODS: The mRNA expression of 37 RNA modification regulators and RNA modification regulators related genes were identified in 112 samples from 5 Gene Expression Omnibus datasets. Nonnegative Matrix Factorization clustering method was performed to determine RNA modification patterns. The ssGSEA algorithms and the expression of human leukocyte antigen were employed to assess the immune microenvironment characteristics. Risk model based on differentially expression genes responsible for the modification regulators was constructed to evaluate its predictive capability in DN patients. Furthermore, the results were validated by using immunofluorescence co-localizations and protein experiments in vitro. RESULTS: We found 24 RNA methylation regulators were significant differently expressed in glomeruli in DN group compared with control group. Four methylation-related genes and six RNA regulators were introduced into riskScore model using univariate Logistic regression and integrated LASSO regression, which could precisely distinguish the DN and healthy individuals. Group with high-risk score was associated with high immune infiltration. Three distinct RNA modification patterns were identified, which has significant differences in immune microenvironment, biological pathway and eGFR. Validation analyses showed the METTL3, ADAR1, DNMT1 were upregulated whereas YTHDC1 was downregulated in DN podocyte cell lines comparing with cells cultured by the normal glucose. CONCLUSION: Our study reveals that RNA methylation regulators and immune infiltration regulation play critical roles in the pathogenesis of DN. The bioinformatic analyses combine with verification in vitro could provide robust evidence for identification of predictive RNA methylation regulators in DN.",2023 Feb 10,Hum Genomics. 2023 Feb 10;17(1):6. doi: 10.1186/s40246-023-00457-9.,"['Li J', 'Liu D', 'Ren J', 'Li G', 'Zhao Z', 'Zhao H', 'Yan Q', 'Duan J', 'Liu Z']",True
36577155,ADAR1 improved Treg cell function through the miR-21b/Foxp3 axis and inhibits the progression of acute graft-versus-host disease after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.,"Th17/Treg equilibrium towards the pro-inflammatory Th17 side contributes greatly to the rejection during allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Forkhead box P3 (Foxp3) is important in the pathogenic conversion between Th17 and Treg cells. However, how Foxp3 expression was regulated is largely unknown. Here, we investigated the role of RNA-editing enzyme ADAR1 in Foxp3-mediated Th17/Treg imbalance and progression of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD), a most serious complication in patients received allo-HSCT. Th1, Th17 and Treg cells were respectively isolated from peripheral blood CD4 + T cells of allo-HSCT patients, and we found that proportions of Th1 and Th17 were markedly increased, while Treg proportion was significantly decreased in aGVHD patients post transplantation compared with non-aGVHD patients, accompanied by decreased ADAR1 and increased miR-21b levels. RNA-immunoprecipitation (RIP) combined with gain- and loss-of-function experiments demonstrated that ADAR1 improved Treg cell functions and negatively regulated the production of miR-21b, a Foxp3-targeting miRNA. Inhibition of miR-21b improved Treg functions, and Foxp3 knockdown could eliminate the effect of miR-21b inhibition or ADAR1 overexpression on Treg function. Finally, an aGVHD mouse model was established and Ad-O/E-ADAR1 was injected into aGVHD mice to verify the effect of ADAR1 on aGVHD progression in vivo. The results showed that ADAR1 overexpression decreased Th17 proportion and increased Treg proportion in aGVHD mice and obviously improved tissue necrosis and reticular structure of aGVHD liver and lung in vivo. Collectively, ADAR1 suppresses miR-21b production and improves Foxp3-mediated Treg cell function to inhibit the progression of aGVHD after allo-HSCT.",2023 Feb,Int Immunopharmacol. 2023 Feb;115:109620. doi: 10.1016/j.intimp.2022.109620.

36593862,Embedding-based link predictions to explore latent comorbidity of chronic diseases.,"PURPOSE: Comorbidity is a term used to describe when a patient simultaneously has more than one chronic disease. Comorbidity is a significant health issue that affects people worldwide. This study aims to use machine learning and graph theory to predict the comorbidity of chronic diseases. METHODS: A patient-disease bipartite graph is constructed based on the administrative claim data. The bipartite graph projection approach was used to create the comorbidity network. For the link prediction task, three graph machine learning embedding-based models (node2vec, graph neural networks and hand-crafted approach) with different variants were used on the comorbidity network to compare their performance. This study also considered three commonly used similarity-based link prediction approaches (Jaccard coefficient, Adamic-Adar index and Resource allocation index) for performance comparison. RESULTS: The results showed that the embedding-based hand-crafted features technique achieved outstanding performance compared with the remaining similarity-based and embedding-based models. Especially, the hand-crafted technique with the extreme gradient boosting classifier achieved the highest accuracy (91.67%), followed by the same technique with the Logistic regression classifier (90.26%). For this shallow embedding method, the Jaccard coefficient and the degree centrality of the original chronic disease were the most important features for comorbidity prediction. CONCLUSION: The proposed framework can be used to predict the comorbidity of chronic disease at an early stage of hospital admission. Thus, the prediction outcome could be valuable for medical practice, giving healthcare providers more control over their services and lowering expenses.",2023 Dec,Health Inf Sci Syst. 2022 Dec 30;11(1):2. doi: 10.1007/s13755-022-00206-7. eCollection 2023 Dec.,"['Lu H', 'Uddin S']",False
37031485,The roles of nucleic acid editing in adaptation of zoonotic viruses to humans.,"Following spillover, viruses must adapt to new selection pressures exerted by antiviral responses in their new hosts. In mammals, cellular defense mechanisms often include viral nucleic acid editing pathways mediated through protein families apolipoprotein-B mRNA-editing complex (APOBEC) and Adenosine Deaminase Acting on ribonucleic acid (ADAR). APOBECs induce C→U transitions in viral genomes; the APOBEC locus is highly polymorphic with variable numbers of APOBEC3 paralogs and target preferences in humans and other mammals. APOBEC3 paralogs have shaped the evolutionary history of human immunodeficiency virus, with compelling bioinformatic evidence also for its mutagenic impact on monkeypox virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. ADAR-1 induces adenose-to-inosine (A→I) substitutions in double-stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA); its role in virus adaptation is less clear, as are epigenetic modifications to viral genomes, such as methylation. Nucleic acid editing restricts evolutionary space in which viruses can explore and may restrict viral-host range.",2023 Apr 7,Curr Opin Virol. 2023 Apr 7;60:101326. doi: 10.1016/j.coviro.2023.101326.,"['Ratcliff J', 'Simmonds P']",False
37028415,Stress granules are shock absorbers that prevent excessive innate immune responses to dsRNA.,"Proper defense against microbial infection depends on the controlled activation of the immune system. This is particularly important for the RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), which recognize viral dsRNA and initiate antiviral innate immune responses with the potential of triggering systemic inflammation and immunopathology. Here, we show that stress granules (SGs), molecular condensates that form in response to various stresses including viral dsRNA, play key roles in the controlled activation of RLR signaling. Without the SG nucleators G3BP1/2 and UBAP2L, dsRNA triggers excessive inflammation and immune-mediated apoptosis. In addition to exogenous dsRNA, host-derived dsRNA generated in response to ADAR1 deficiency is also controlled by SG biology. Intriguingly, SGs can function beyond immune control by suppressing viral replication independently of the RLR pathway. These observations thus highlight the multi-functional nature of SGs as cellular ""shock absorbers"" that converge on protecting cell homeostasis by dampening both toxic immune response and viral replication.",2023 Apr 6,Mol Cell. 2023 Apr 6;83(7):1180-1196.e8. doi: 10.1016/j.molcel.2023.03.010.,"['Paget M', 'Cadena C', 'Ahmad S', 'Wang HT', 'Jordan TX', 'Kim E', 'Koo B', 'Lyons SM', 'Ivanov P', 'tenOever B', 'Mu X', 'Hur S']",False
37024492,Mapping the landscape of genetic dependencies in chordoma.,"Identifying the spectrum of genes required for cancer cell survival can reveal essential cancer circuitry and therapeutic targets, but such a map remains incomplete for many cancer types. We apply genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function screens to map the landscape of selectively essential genes in chordoma, a bone cancer with few validated targets. This approach confirms a known chordoma dependency, TBXT (T; brachyury), and identifies a range of additional dependencies, including PTPN11, ADAR, PRKRA, LUC7L2, SRRM2, SLC2A1, SLC7A5, FANCM, and THAP1. CDK6, SOX9, and EGFR, genes previously implicated in chordoma biology, are also recovered. We find genomic and transcriptomic features that predict specific dependencies, including interferon-stimulated gene expression, which correlates with ADAR dependence and is elevated in chordoma. Validating the therapeutic relevance of dependencies, small-molecule inhibitors of SHP2, encoded by PTPN11, have potent preclinical efficacy against chordoma.

37047766,"Molecular Docking and Dynamics Simulation Studies Predict Potential Anti-ADAR2 Inhibitors: Implications for the Treatment of Cancer, Neurological, Immunological and Infectious Diseases.","Altered RNA editing has been linked to several neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability, in addition to depression, schizophrenia, some cancers, viral infections and autoimmune disorders. The human ADAR2 is a potential therapeutic target for managing these various disorders due to its crucial role in adenosine to inosine editing. This study applied consensus scoring to rank potential ADAR2 inhibitors after performing molecular docking with AutoDock Vina and Glide (Maestro), using a library of 35,161 compounds obtained from traditional Chinese medicine. A total of 47 compounds were predicted to be good binders of the human ADAR2 and had insignificant toxicity concerns. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, including the molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA) procedure, also emphasized the binding of the shortlisted compounds. The potential compounds had plausible binding free energies ranging from -81.304 to -1068.26 kJ/mol from the MM/PBSA calculations. ZINC000085511995, a naphthoquinone had more negative binding free energy (-1068.26 kJ/mol) than inositol hexakisphosphate (IHP) [-873.873 kJ/mol], an agonist and a strong binder of ADAR2. The potential displacement of IHP by ZINC000085511995 in the IHP binding site of ADAR2 could be explored for possible deactivation of ADAR2. Bayesian-based biological activity prediction corroborates the neuropharmacological, antineoplastic and antiviral activity of the potential lead compounds. All the potential lead compounds, except ZINC000014612330 and ZINC000013462928, were predicted to be inhibitors of various deaminases. The potential lead compounds also had probability of activity (Pa) > 0.442 and probability of inactivity (Pi) < 0.116 values for treating acute neurologic disorders, except for ZINC000085996580 and ZINC000013462928. Pursuing these compounds for their anti-ADAR2 activities holds a promising future, especially against neurological disorders, some cancers and viral infections caused by RNA viruses. Molecular interaction, hydrogen bond and per-residue decomposition analyses predicted Arg400, Arg401, Lys519, Trp687, Glu689, and Lys690 as hot-spot residues in the ADAR2 IHP binding site. Most of the top compounds were observed to have naphthoquinone, indole, furanocoumarin or benzofuran moieties. Serotonin and tryptophan, which are beneficial in digestive regulation, improving sleep cycle and mood, are indole derivatives. These chemical series may have the potential to treat neurological disorders, prion diseases, some cancers, specific viral infections, metabolic disorders and eating disorders through the disruption of ADAR2 pathways.

Concerns have been raised due to the rapid dissemination of the chikungunya virus (CHIKV) across the country since its first detection in 2014 in Northeast Brazil. Faced with this scenario, on-site training activities in genomic surveillance carried out in partnership with the National Network of Public Health Laboratories have led to the generation of 422 CHIKV genomes from 12 Brazilian states over the past two years (2021-2022), a period that has seen more than 312 thousand chikungunya fever cases reported in the country. These new genomes increased the amount of available data and allowed a more comprehensive characterization of the dispersion dynamics of the CHIKV East-Central-South-African (ECSA) lineage in Brazil. Tree branching patterns revealed the emergence and expansion of two distinct subclades. Phylogeographic analysis indicated that the northeast region has been the leading hub of virus spread towards other regions. Increased frequency of C>T transitions among the new genomes suggested that host restriction factors from the immune system such as ADAR and AID/APOBEC deaminases might be driving CHIKV ECSA lineage genetic diversity in Brazil.",2023 Apr 3,medRxiv. 2023 Apr 3:2023.03.28.23287733. doi: 10.1101/2023.03.28.23287733.

37104086,ADAR1 affects gastric cancer cell metastasis and reverses cisplatin resistance through AZIN1.,"Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA1 (ADAR1) are involved in the occurrence and development of cancers. Although the role of ADAR1 in gastric cancer metastasis has been reported, the role of ADAR1 in the mechanism of cisplatin resistance in gastric cancer is not clear. In this study, human gastric cancer tissue specimens were used to construct cisplatin-resistant gastric cancer cells; the results indicated that the mechanism underlying the inhibition of gastric cancer metastasis and reversal of cisplatin-resistant gastric cancer by ADAR1 inhibits gastric cancer occurs through the antizyme inhibitor 1 (AZIN1) pathway. We assessed ADAR1 and AZIN1 expression in the tissues of patients with low to moderately differentiated gastric cancer. Gastric cancer cells (human gastric adenocarcinoma cell line [AGS] and HGC-27 cells) and gastric cancer cisplatin-resistant cells (AGS CDDP and HGC-27 CDDP ) were selected, and the protein expression of ADAR1 and AZIN1 was detected using immunocytochemistry and immunocytofluorescence. The effects of ADAR1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) on the invasion, migration and proliferation of cisplatin-resistant gastric cancer cells were investigated. Western blot assays were used to assess the protein expression levels of ADAR1, AZIN1 and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related markers. In-vivo experiments, a subcutaneous tumor formation model of nude mice was established, and the effects of ADAR1 on tumor growth and AZIN1 expression level were detected by hematoxylin and eosin, immunohistochemistry and western blot. The expression of ADAR1 and AZIN1 in human gastric cancer tissue was significantly higher than that in paracancerous tissues. The colocalization of ADAR1, AZIN1 and E-cadherin expression in immunofluorescence assays indicated a significant correlation between the three. In in-vitro experiments, ADAR1 knockout not only reduced the invasion and migration ability of AGS and HGC-27 cells but also reduced that of cisplatin-resistant gastric cancer cells. ADAR1 siRNA inhibited the proliferation and decreased the colony number of cisplatin-resistant gastric cancer cells. ADAR1 siRNA decreased the expression of AZIN1 and EMT-related marker proteins (vimentin, N-cadherin, β-catenin, MMP9, MMP2 and TWIST). The effect of ADAR1 siRNA combined with AZIN1 siRNA was more significant. In-vivo, the knockdown of ADAR1 significantly inhibited tumor growth and AZIN1 expression. ADAR1 and AZIN1 are antimetastatic targets of gastric cancer, and AZIN1 is a downstream regulatory target of ADAR1. ADAR1 knockout can inhibit the metastasis of gastric cancer cells and reverse the cisplatin resistance of gastric cancer cells by downregulating the expression of AZIN1, potentially resulting in increased treatment efficacy.",2023 Apr 28,Anticancer Drugs. 2023 Apr 28. doi: 10.1097/CAD.0000000000001516.,"['Wang H', 'Yang L', 'Liu R', 'He H', 'Zhang M', 'Xu Y']",True
37017521,ADAR1 Biology Can Hinder Effective Antiviral RNA Interference.,"Viruses constantly evolve and adapt to the antiviral defenses of their hosts. The biology of viral circumvention of these selective pressures can often be attributed to the acquisition of novel antagonistic gene products or by rapid genome change that prevents host recognition. To study viral evasion of RNA interference (RNAi)-based defenses, we established a robust antiviral system in mammalian cells using recombinant Sendai virus designed to be targeted by endogenous host microRNAs (miRNAs) with perfect complementarity. Using this system, we previously demonstrated the intrinsic ability of positive-strand RNA viruses to escape this selective pressure via homologous recombination, which was not observed in negative-strand RNA viruses. Here, we show that given extensive time, escape of miRNA-targeted Sendai virus was enabled by host adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1). Independent of the viral transcript targeted, ADAR1 editing resulted in disruption of the miRNA-silencing motif, suggesting an intolerance for extensive RNA-RNA interactions necessary for antiviral RNAi. This was further supported in Nicotiana benthamiana, where exogenous expression of ADAR1 interfered with endogenous RNAi. Together, these results suggest that ADAR1 diminishes the effectiveness of RNAi and may explain why it is absent in species that utilize this antiviral defense system. IMPORTANCE All life at the cellular level has the capacity to induce an antiviral response. Here, we examine the result of imposing the antiviral response of one branch of life onto another and find evidence for conflict. To determine the consequences of eliciting an RNAi-like defense in mammals, we applied this pressure to a recombinant Sendai virus in cell culture. We find that ADAR1, a host gene involved in regulation of the mammalian response to virus, prevented RNAi-mediated silencing and subsequently allowed for viral replication. In addition, the expression of ADAR1 in Nicotiana benthamiana, which lacks ADARs and has an endogenous RNAi system, suppresses gene silencing. These data indicate that ADAR1 is disruptive to RNAi biology and provide insight into the evolutionary relationship between ADARs and antiviral defenses in eukaryotic life.",2023 Apr 27,J Virol. 2023 Apr 27;97(4):e0024523. doi: 10.1128/jvi.00245-23.

Here, a compact and efficient RNA base editor (ceRBE) is reported with high in vivo editing efficiency. The larger dCas13 protein is replaced with a 199-amino acid EcCas6e protein, derived from the Class 1 CRISPR family involved in pre-crRNA processing, and conducted optimization for toxicity and editing efficiency.

36840708,Development of a selection assay for small guide RNAs that drive efficient site-directed RNA editing.,"A major challenge confronting the clinical application of site-directed RNA editing (SDRE) is the design of small guide RNAs (gRNAs) that can drive efficient editing. Although many gRNA designs have effectively recruited endogenous Adenosine Deaminases that Act on RNA (ADARs), most of them exceed the size of currently FDA-approved antisense oligos. We developed an unbiased in vitro selection assay to identify short gRNAs that promote superior RNA editing of a premature termination codon. The selection assay relies on hairpin substrates in which the target sequence is linked to partially randomized gRNAs in the same molecule, so that gRNA sequences that promote editing can be identified by sequencing. These RNA substrates were incubated in vitro with ADAR2 and the edited products were selected using amplification refractory mutation system PCR and used to regenerate the substrates for a new round of selection. After nine repetitions, hairpins which drove superior editing were identified. When gRNAs of these hairpins were delivered in trans, eight of the top ten short gRNAs drove superior editing both in vitro and in cellula. These results show that efficient small gRNAs can be selected using our approach, an important advancement for the clinical application of SDRE.",2023 Apr 24,Nucleic Acids Res. 2023 Apr 24;51(7):e41. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkad098.,"['Diaz Quiroz JF', 'Ojha N', 'Shayhidin EE', 'De Silva D', 'Dabney J', 'Lancaster A', 'Coull J', 'Milstein S', 'Fraley AW', 'Brown CR', 'Rosenthal JJC']",True

Here, a genetically engineered nanovesicle (siAdar1-LNP@mPD1) was developed as an RNA interference nano-tool to overcome tumor resistance to ICB therapies. Small interfering RNA against ADAR1 (siAdar1) was packaged into a lipid nanoparticle (LNP), which was further coated with plasma membrane extracted from the genetically engineered cells overexpressing PD1. siAdar1-LNP@mPD1 could block the PD1/PDL1 immune inhibitory axis by presenting the PD1 protein on the coating membranes. Furthermore, siAdar1 could be effectively delivered into cancer cells by the designed nanovesicle to silence ADAR1 expression, resulting in an increased type I/II interferon (IFN-β/γ) production and making the cancer cells more sensitive to secreted effector cytokines such as IFN-γ with significant cell growth arrest. These integrated functions confer siAdar1-LNP@mPD1 with robust and comprehensive antitumor immunity, as evidenced by significant tumor growth regression, abscopal tumor prevention, and effective suppression of lung metastasis, through a global remodeling of the tumor immune microenvironment.

36972568,Selective Inhibition of ADAR1 Using 8-Azanebularine-Modified RNA Duplexes.,"Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) are RNA editing enzymes that catalyze the hydrolytic deamination of adenosine (A) to inosine (I) in dsRNA. In humans, two catalytically active ADARs, ADAR1 and ADAR2, perform this A-to-I editing event. The growing field of nucleotide base editing has highlighted ADARs as promising therapeutic agents while multiple studies have also identified ADAR1's role in cancer progression. However, the potential for site-directed RNA editing as well as the rational design of inhibitors is being hindered by the lack of detailed molecular understanding of RNA recognition by ADAR1. Here, we designed short RNA duplexes containing the nucleoside analog, 8-azanebularine (8-azaN), to gain insight into molecular recognition by the human ADAR1 catalytic domain. From gel shift and in vitro deamination experiments, we validate ADAR1 catalytic domain's duplex secondary structure requirement and present a minimum duplex length for binding (14 bp, with 5 bp 5' and 8 bp 3' to editing site). These findings concur with predicted RNA-binding contacts from a previous structural model of the ADAR1 catalytic domain. Finally, we establish that neither 8-azaN as a free nucleoside nor a ssRNA bearing 8-azaN inhibits ADAR1 and demonstrate that the 8-azaN-modified RNA duplexes selectively inhibit ADAR1 and not the closely related ADAR2 enzyme.",2023 Apr 18,Biochemistry. 2023 Apr 18;62(8):1376-1387. doi: 10.1021/acs.biochem.2c00686.

37040436,Library Screening Reveals Sequence Motifs That Enable ADAR2 Editing at Recalcitrant Sites.,"Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) catalyze the hydrolytic deamination of adenosine to inosine in duplex RNA. The inosine product preferentially base pairs with cytidine resulting in an effective A-to-G edit in RNA. ADAR editing can result in a recoding event alongside other alterations to RNA function. A consequence of ADARs' selective activity on duplex RNA is that guide RNAs (gRNAs) can be designed to target an adenosine of interest and promote a desired recoding event. One of ADAR's main limitations is its preference to edit adenosines with specific 5' and 3' nearest neighbor nucleotides (e.g., 5' U, 3' G). Current rational design approaches are well-suited for this ideal sequence context, but limited when applied to difficult-to-edit sites. Here we describe a strategy for the in vitro evaluation of very large libraries of ADAR substrates (En Masse Evaluation of RNA Guides, EMERGe). EMERGe allows for a comprehensive screening of ADAR substrate RNAs that complements current design approaches. We used this approach to identify sequence motifs for gRNAs that enable editing in otherwise difficult-to-edit target sites. A guide RNA bearing one of these sequence motifs enabled the cellular repair of a premature termination codon arising from mutation of the MECP2 gene associated with Rett Syndrome. EMERGe provides an advancement in screening that not only allows for novel gRNA design, but also furthers our understanding of ADARs' specific RNA-protein interactions.",2023 Apr 11,ACS Chem Biol. 2023 Apr 11. doi: 10.1021/acschembio.3c00107.,"['Jacobsen CS', 'Salvador P', 'Yung JF', 'Kragness S', 'Mendoza HG', 'Mandel G', 'Beal PA']",True
37036839,Increased A-to-I RNA editing in atherosclerosis and cardiomyopathies.,"Adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing is essential to prevent undesired immune activation. This diverse process alters the genetic content of the RNA and may recode proteins, change splice sites and miRNA targets, and mimic genomic mutations. Recent studies have associated or implicated aberrant editing with pathological conditions, including cancer, autoimmune diseases, and neurological and psychiatric conditions. RNA editing patterns in cardiovascular tissues have not been investigated systematically so far, and little is known about its potential role in cardiac diseases. Some hints suggest robust editing in this system, including the fact that ADARB1 (ADAR2), the main coding-sequence editor, is most highly expressed in these tissues. Here we characterized RNA editing in the heart and arteries and examined a contributory role to the development of atherosclerosis and two structural heart diseases -Ischemic and Dilated Cardiomyopathies. Analyzing hundreds of RNA-seq samples taken from the heart and arteries of cardiac patients and controls, we find that global editing, alongside inflammatory gene expression, is increased in patients with atherosclerosis, cardiomyopathies, and heart failure. We describe a single recoding editing site and suggest it as a target for focused research. This recoding editing site in the IGFBP7 gene is one of the only evolutionary conserved sites between mammals, and we found it exhibits consistently increased levels of editing in these patients. Our findings reveal that RNA editing is abundant in arteries and is elevated in several key cardiovascular conditions. They thus provide a roadmap for basic and translational research of RNA as a mediator of atherosclerosis and non-genetic cardiomyopathies.",2023 Apr,PLoS Comput Biol. 2023 Apr 10;19(4):e1010923. doi: 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010923. eCollection 2023 Apr.,"['Mann TD', 'Kopel E', 'Eisenberg E', 'Levanon EY']",True
34874587,Integrative Analysis of ceRNA Networks in human periodontal ligament stem cells under hypoxia.,"OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the regulatory effect of hypoxia on human periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) through RNA sequencing (RNA SEQ). Human PDLSCs were cultured in normoxia (20% O(2) ) or hypoxia (2% O(2) ). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Total RNA was extracted and sequenced. The expression profiles of circRNAs, lncRNAs, and miRNAs were determined, and the lncRNA/circRNA-miRNA-mRNA networks were analyzed. RESULTS: In total, 15 miRNAs, 449 lncRNAs, and 53 circRNAs were differentially expressed. Among them, 21 circRNAs, 262 lncRNAs, 5 miRNAs, and 5 mRNAs were selected to construct competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses were carried out to explore potential related pathways and regulatory functions. Several ceRNA axes (lncRNA-FTX/circRNA-FAT1-hsa-miR-4781-3p-SMAD5 and circRNA LPAR1-hsa-miR-342-3p-ADAR) may provide a theoretical basis on the study of osteogenic differentiation of PDLSCs under hypoxia.

Current pharmacological or interventional treatments help to tackle symptoms and even reduce mortality, but cardiovascular disease cases continue to rise. The emergence of novel therapeutic strategies that precisely and efficiently combat cardiovascular disease is therefore deemed more essential than ever. RNA editing, the cell-intrinsic deamination of adenosine or cytidine RNA residues, changes the molecular identity of edited nucleotides, severely altering the fate of RNA molecules involved in key biological processes. The most common type of RNA editing is the deamination of adenosine residue to inosine (A-to-I), which is catalysed by adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs). Recent efforts have convincingly liaised RNA editing-based mechanisms to the pathophysiology of the cardiovascular system. In this review, we will briefly introduce the basic concepts of the RNA editing field of research.

36669890,Site-directed A → I RNA editing as a therapeutic tool: moving beyond genetic mutations.,"Adenosine deamination by the ADAR family of enzymes is a natural process that edits genetic information as it passes through messenger RNA. Adenosine is converted to inosine in mRNAs, and this base is interpreted as guanosine during translation. Realizing the potential of this activity for therapeutics, a number of researchers have developed systems that redirect ADAR activity to new targets, ones that are not normally edited. These site-directed RNA editing (SDRE) systems can be broadly classified into two categories: ones that deliver an antisense RNA oligonucleotide to bind opposite a target adenosine, creating an editable structure that endogenously expressed ADARs recognize, and ones that tether the catalytic domain of recombinant ADAR to an antisense RNA oligonucleotide that serves as a targeting mechanism, much like with CRISPR-Cas or RNAi. To date, SDRE has been used mostly to try and correct genetic mutations. Here we argue that these applications are not ideal SDRE, mostly because RNA edits are transient and genetic mutations are not. Instead, we suggest that SDRE could be used to tune cell physiology to achieve temporary outcomes that are therapeutically advantageous, particularly in the nervous system. These include manipulating excitability in nociceptive neural circuits, abolishing specific phosphorylation events to reduce protein aggregation related to neurodegeneration or reduce the glial scarring that inhibits nerve regeneration, or enhancing G protein-coupled receptor signaling to increase nerve proliferation for the treatment of sensory disorders like blindness and deafness.",2023 Apr,RNA. 2023 Apr;29(4):498-505. doi: 10.1261/rna.079518.122.

36908749,Strain-specific responsiveness of hepatitis D virus to interferon-alpha treatment.,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Pegylated interferon alpha (pegIFNα) is commonly used for the treatment of people infected with HDV. However, its mode of action in HDV-infected cells remains elusive and only a minority of people respond to pegIFNα therapy. Herein, we aimed to assess the responsiveness of three different cloned HDV strains to pegIFNα. We used a previously cloned HDV genotype 1 strain (dubbed HDV-1a) that appeared insensitive to interferon-α in vitro, a new HDV strain (HDV-1p) we isolated from an individual achieving later sustained response to IFNα therapy, and one phylogenetically distant genotype 3 strain (HDV-3). METHODS: PegIFNα was administered to human liver chimeric mice infected with HBV and the different HDV strains or to HBV/HDV infected human hepatocytes isolated from chimeric mice. Virological parameters and host responses were analysed by qPCR, sequencing, immunoblotting, RNA in situ hybridisation and immunofluorescence staining. RESULTS: PegIFNα treatment efficiently reduced HDV RNA viraemia (∼2-log) and intrahepatic HDV markers both in mice infected with HBV/HDV-1p and HBV/HDV-3. In contrast, HDV parameters remained unaffected by pegIFNα treatment both in mice (up to 9 weeks) and in isolated cells infected with HBV/HDV-1a. Notably, HBV viraemia was efficiently lowered (∼2-log) and human interferon-stimulated genes similarly induced in all three HBV/HDV-infected mouse groups receiving pegIFNα. Genome sequencing revealed highly conserved ribozyme and L-hepatitis D antigen post-translational modification sites among all three isolates. CONCLUSIONS: Our comparative study indicates the ability of pegIFNα to lower HDV loads in stably infected human hepatocytes in vivo and the existence of complex virus-specific determinants of IFNα responsiveness. IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: Understanding factors counteracting HDV infections is paramount to develop curative therapies. We compared the responsiveness of three different cloned HDV strains to pegylated interferon alpha in chronically infected mice.

37046093,Genomic-transcriptomic evolution in lung cancer and metastasis.,"Intratumour heterogeneity (ITH) fuels lung cancer evolution, which leads to immune evasion and resistance to therapy(1). Here, using paired whole-exome and RNA sequencing data, we investigate intratumour transcriptomic diversity in 354 non-small cell lung cancer tumours from 347 out of the first 421 patients prospectively recruited into the TRACERx study(2,3). Analyses of 947 tumour regions, representing both primary and metastatic disease, alongside 96 tumour-adjacent normal tissue samples implicate the transcriptome as a major source of phenotypic variation. Gene expression levels and ITH relate to patterns of positive and negative selection during tumour evolution. We observe frequent copy number-independent allele-specific expression that is linked to epigenomic dysfunction. Allele-specific expression can also result in genomic-transcriptomic parallel evolution, which converges on cancer gene disruption. We extract signatures of RNA single-base substitutions and link their aetiology to the activity of the RNA-editing enzymes ADAR and APOBEC3A, thereby revealing otherwise undetected ongoing APOBEC activity in tumours. Characterizing the transcriptomes of primary-metastatic tumour pairs, we combine multiple machine-learning approaches that leverage genomic and transcriptomic variables to link metastasis-seeding potential to the evolutionary context of mutations and increased proliferation within primary tumour regions.

36892774,Detecting Z-RNA and Z-DNA in Mammalian Cells.,"Eukaryotic cells sense and respond to virus infections by detecting conserved virus-generated molecular structures, called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). PAMPs are usually produced by replicating viruses, but not typically seen in uninfected cells. Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is a common PAMP produced by most, if not all, RNA viruses, as well as by many DNA viruses. DsRNA can adopt either the right-handed (A-RNA) or the left-handed (Z-RNA) double-helical conformation. A-RNA is sensed by cytosolic pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) such as RIG-1-like receptor MDA-5 and the dsRNA-dependent protein kinase PKR. Z-RNA is detected by Zα domain containing PRRs, including Z-form nucleic acid binding protein 1 (ZBP1) and the p150 subunit of adenosine deaminase RNA specific 1 (ADAR1). We have recently shown that Z-RNA is generated during orthomyxovirus (e.g., influenza A virus) infections and serves as activating ligand for ZBP1. In this chapter, we describe our procedure for detecting Z-RNA in influenza A virus (IAV)-infected cells.

36892776,Z-DNA and Z-RNA: Methods-Past and Future.,"A quote attributed to Yogi Berra makes the observation that ""It's tough to make predictions, especially about the future,"" highlighting the difficulties posed to an author writing a manuscript like the present. The history of Z-DNA shows that earlier postulates about its biology have failed the test of time, both those from proponents who were wildly enthusiastic in enunciating roles that till this day still remain elusive to experimental validation and those from skeptics within the larger community who considered the field a folly, presumably because of the limitations in the methods available at that time. If anything, the biological roles we now know for Z-DNA and Z-RNA were not anticipated by anyone, even when those early predictions are interpreted in the most favorable way possible. The breakthroughs in the field were made using a combination of methods, especially those based on human and mouse genetic approaches informed by the biochemical and biophysical characterization of the Zα family of proteins. The first success was with the p150 Zα isoform of ADAR1 (adenosine deaminase RNA specific), with insights into the functions of ZBP1 (Z-DNA-binding protein 1) following soon after from the cell death community. Just as the replacement of mechanical clocks by more accurate designs changed expectations about navigation, the discovery of the roles assigned by nature to alternative conformations like Z-DNA has forever altered our view of how the genome operates. These recent advances have been driven by better methodology and by better analytical approaches. This article will briefly describe the methods that were key to these discoveries and highlight areas where new method development is likely to further advance our knowledge.",2023,Methods Mol Biol. 2023;2651:295-329. doi: 10.1007/978-1-0716-3084-6_21.,['Herbert A'],True
36895481,Genome-wide identification of A-to-I RNA editing events provides the functional implications in PDAC.,"INTRODUCTION: RNA editing, a wide-acknowledged post-transcriptional mechanism, has been reported to be involved in the occurrence and development of cancer, especially the abnormal alteration of adenosine to inosine. However, fewer studies focus on pancreaticcancer. Therefore, we aimed to explore the possible linkages between altered RNA editing events and the development of PDAC. METHOD: We characterized the global A-to-I RNA editing spectrum from RNA and matched whole-genome sequencing data of 41 primary PDAC and adjacent normal tissues. The following analyses were performed: different editing level and RNA expression analysis,pathway analysis, motif analysis, RNA secondary structure analysis, alternative splicing events analysis, and survival analysis.The RNA editing of single-cell RNA public sequencing data was also characterized. RESULT: A large number of adaptive RNA editing events with significant differences in editing levels were identified, which are mainly regulated by ADAR1. Moreover, RNA editing in tumors has a higher editing level and more abundant editing sites in general. 140genes were screened out since they were identified with significantly different RNA editing events and were significantly different in expression level between tumor and matched normal samples. Further analysis showed a preference that in the tumor-specific group, they are mainly enriched in cancer-related signal pathways, while in the normal tissue-specific group, they are mainly enriched in pancreatic secretion. At the same time, we also found positively selected differentially edited sites in a series of cancer immune genes, including EGF, IGF1R, and PIK3CD. RNA editing might participate in pathogenisis of PDAC through regulating the alternative splicing and RNA secondary structure of important genesto further regulate gene expression and protein synthesis, including RAB27B and CERS4. Furthermore, single cell sequencing results showed that type2 ductal cells contributed the most to RNA editing events in tumors.

37123418,The involvement of ADAR1 in chronic unpredictable stress-induced cognitive impairment by targeting DARPP-32 with miR-874-3p in BALB/c mice.,"Introduction: Chronic stress exposure is the main environmental factor leading to cognitive impairment, but the detailed molecular mechanism is still unclear. Adenosine Deaminase acting on double-stranded RNA1(ADAR1) is involved in the occurrence of chronic stress-induced cognitive impairment. In addition, dopamine and Adenosine 3'5'-monophosphate-regulated phospho-protein (DARPP-32) gene variation affects cognitive function. Therefore, we hypothesized that ADAR1 plays a key role in chronic stress-induced cognitive impairment by acting on DARPP-32. Methods: In this study, postnatal 21-day-old male BALB/c mice were exposed to chronic unpredictable stressors. After that, the mice were treated with ADAR1 inducer/inhibitor. The cognitive ability and cerebral DARPP-32 protein expression of BALB/c mice were evaluated. In order to explore the link between ADAR1 and DARPP-32, the effects of ADAR1 high/low expression on DARPP-32 protein expression in vitro were detected. Results: ADAR1 inducer alleviates cognitive impairment and recovers decreased DARPP-32 protein expression of the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex in BALB/c mice with chronic unpredictable stress exposure. In vivo and in vitro studies confirm the results predicted by bio-informatics; that is, ADAR1 affects DARPP-32 expression via miR-874-3p. Discussion: The results in this study demonstrate that ADAR1 affects the expression of DARPP-32 via miR-874-3p, which is involved in the molecular mechanism of pathogenesis in chronic unpredictable stress-induced cognitive impairment.

In the present study, we aimed to investigate the relationship among transcript factors-microRNAs regulatory network, immune environment, and ADAR gene in colorectal carcinoma (CRC). The association among the expression levels of ADAR mRNA and copy number variation, methylation, and mutation status were comprehensively analyzed using cBioPortal, Wanderer, and UALCAN databases in CRC datasets. ADAR-transcript factors (TFs) and ADAR-miRNA regulation networks were constructed by Cistrome Cancer and miRWalk2.0, respectively. The full network and subnetworks for ADAR coexpression genes were constructed using the STRING database and visualized by the MCODE module of the Cytoscape app. The relationship between ADAR mRNA expression and the abundance of infiltrating immune cells in CRC patients was explored by the Tumor Immune Estimation Resource, CIBERSORT, and single-gene gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). ADAR mRNA was elevated and was a cancer essential gene in CRC. ADAR mRNA and transcripts P110 were significantly elevated in CRC compared to normal controls. Low-level methylation in the promoter region and high copy number amplification of ADAR were responsible for high levels of ADAR mRNA expression. ADAR coexpression genes were mainly involved in immunoregulation, especially T-lymphocyte activation. Hub genes, including CD2, CD274, and FASLG, were also significantly upregulated in the ADAR-high group compared to the control group. Besides, M1 macrophages were enriched in the ADAR-high group compared to the control group.

Although there were currently cellular and animal assays supporting the relationship between ADAR1 and specific cancers, there was no correlation analysis that has been performed at the pan-cancer level. Therefore, we first analyzed the expression of ADAR1 in 33 cancers based on the TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) database. ADAR1 was highly expressed in most cancers, and there was a closely association between ADAR1 expression and prognosis of patients. Furthermore, pathway enrichment analysis revealed that ADAR1 was involved in multiple antigens presenting and processing inflammatory and interferon pathways. Moreover, ADAR1 expression was positively correlated with CD8(+) T cell infiltration levels in renal papillary cell carcinoma, prostate cancer, and endometrial cancer and negatively correlated with Treg cell infiltration. In addition, we further found that ADAR1 expression was closely associated with various immune checkpoints and chemokines. Meanwhile, we observed that ADAR1 may be involved in the regulation of pan-cancer stemness. In conclusion, we provided a comprehensive understanding of the oncogenic role of ADAR1 in pan-cancer, and ADAR1 might serve as a new potential target for antitumor therapy.",2023,Dis Markers. 2023 Feb 21;2023:7620181. doi: 10.1155/2023/7620181. eCollection 2023.,"['Zhu J', 'Zheng J', 'Zhang J', 'Wang S', 'Wang L', 'Zhao Y']",True

36960293,"The occurrence, characteristics, and adaptation of A-to-I RNA editing in bacteria: A review.","A-to-I RNA editing is a very important post-transcriptional modification or co-transcriptional modification that creates isoforms and increases the diversity of proteins. In this process, adenosine (A) in RNA molecules is hydrolyzed and deaminated into inosine (I). It is well known that ADAR (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA)-dependent A-to-I mRNA editing is widespread in animals. Next, the discovery of A-to-I mRNA editing was mediated by TadA (tRNA-specific adenosine deaminase) in Escherichia coli which is ADAR-independent event. Previously, the editing event S128P on the flagellar structural protein FliC enhanced the bacterial tolerance to oxidative stress in Xoc. In addition, the editing events T408A on the enterobactin iron receptor protein XfeA act as switches by controlling the uptake of Fe(3+) in response to the concentration of iron in the environment. Even though bacteria have fewer editing events, the great majority of those that are currently preserved have adaptive benefits. Interestingly, it was found that a TadA-independent A-to-I RNA editing event T408A occurred on xfeA, indicating that there may be other new enzymes that perform a function like TadA. Here, we review recent advances in the characteristics, functions, and adaptations of editing in bacteria.",2023,Front Microbiol. 2023 Mar 7;14:1143929. doi: 10.3389/fmicb.2023.1143929. eCollection 2023.,"['Liao W', 'Nie W', 'Ahmad I', 'Chen G', 'Zhu B']",False
36970122,The Allelic Expression of RNA Editing Gene ADARB1 in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Treated with Transarterial Chemoembolization.,"INTRODUCTION: Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the commonly used therapy of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), though the prognosis of different TACE-treated HCC patients varies, which may be due to the heterogeneity of HCC tumors caused by genetic variants and epigenetic changes such as RNA editing. There is dysregulated RNA adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing in HCC and RNA-edited genes are involved in the epigenetic process. It remains unclear how genetic variants of RNA editing genes affect the prognosis of HCC cases treated by TACE. METHODS: In this study, we examined 28 potentially functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of four RNA editing genes (ADARB1, ADAR, ADARB2 and AIMP2) in two independent TACE patient cohorts. RESULTS: We found that ADARB1 rs1051367 and rs2253763 polymorphisms were markedly associated with the prognosis of HCC cases who received TACE in both cohorts. In HCC cells, the rs2253763 C-to-T change in ADARB1 3'-untranslated region attenuated its binding with miR-542-3p and allele-specifically elevated ADARB1 levels. Consistent with this, patients carrying the rs2253763 C allele showed reduced ADARB1 expression in cancer tissues and notably shorter survival after TACE therapy in comparison with individuals with the T allele. Ectopic ADARB1 profoundly enhanced the efficacy of oxaliplatin, one of the common TACE chemotherapeutic drugs. DISCUSSION: Our findings highlighted the value of ADARB1 polymorphisms as prognostic markers in TACE therapy for HCC patients. Notably, our findings revealed that targeting the ADARB1 enzyme may be a promising therapeutic strategy in combination with TACE for HCC cases.",2023,Pharmgenomics Pers Med. 2023 Mar 18;16:229-238. doi: 10.2147/PGPM.S402115. eCollection 2023.,"['Zeng J', 'Han L', 'Wang T', 'Huang L', 'Zheng Y', 'Zhang N', 'Li Z', 'Yang M']",True
37205306,Vascular Contributions to the Neurobiological Effects of Prenatal Alcohol Exposure.,"Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are often characterized as a cluster of brain-based disabilities. Though cardiovascular effects of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) have been documented, the vascular deficits due to PAE are less understood, but may contribute substantially to the severity of neurobehavioral presentation and health outcomes in persons with FASD. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of research articles curated in PubMed to assess the strength of the research on vascular effects of PAE. 40 pertinent papers were selected, covering studies in both human populations and animal models. RESULTS: Studies in human populations identified cardiac defects, and defects in vasculature, including increased tortuosity, defects in basement membranes, capillary basal hyperplasia, endarteritis, and disorganized and diminished cerebral vasculature due to PAE. Preclinical studies showed that PAE rapidly and persistently results in vasodilation of large afferent cerebral arteries, but to vasoconstriction of smaller cerebral arteries and microvasculature. Moreover, PAE continues to affect cerebral blood flow into middle-age. Human and animal studies also indicate that ocular vascular parameters may have diagnostic and predictive value. A number of intervening mechanisms were identified, including increased autophagy, inflammation and deficits in mitochondria. Studies in animals identified persistent changes in blood flow and vascular density associated with endocannabinoid, prostacyclin and nitric oxide signaling, as well as calcium mobilization. CONCLUSION: Although the brain has been a particular focus of studies on PAE, the cardiovascular system is equally affected. Studies in human populations, though constrained by small sample sizes, did link pathology in major blood vessels and tissue vasculature, including brain vasculature, to PAE. Animal studies highlighted molecular mechanisms that may be useful therapeutic targets. Collectively, these studies suggest that vascular pathology is a possible contributing factor to neurobehavioral and health problems across a lifespan in persons with a diagnosis of FASD. Furthermore, ocular vasculature may serve as a biomarker for neurovascular health in FASD.",2023,Adv Drug Alcohol Res. 2023;3:10924. doi: 10.3389/adar.2023.10924.

37223095,An essential role of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 in coeliac disease mucosa.,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Type I interferons (IFNs) are highly expressed in the gut mucosa of celiac disease (CD) gut mucosa and stimulates immune response prompted by gluten ingestion, but the processes that maintain the production of these inflammatory molecules are not well understood. Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1), an RNA-editing enzyme, plays a crucial role in inhibiting self or viral RNAs from activating auto-immune mediated responses, most notably within the type-I IFN production pathway. The aim of this study was to assess whether ADAR1 could contribute to the induction and/or progression of gut inflammation in patients with celiac disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: ADAR1 expression was assessed by Real time PCR and Western blotting in duodenal biopsy taken from inactive and active celiac disease (CD) patients and normal controls (CTR). To analyze the role of ADAR1 in inflamed CD mucosa, lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMC) were isolated from inactive CD and ADAR1 was silenced in with a specific antisense oligonucleotide (AS) and then incubated with a synthetic analogue of viral dsRNA (poly I:C). IFN-inducing pathways (IRF3, IRF7) in these cells were evaluated with Western blotting and inflammatory cytokines were evaluated with flow cytometry. Lastly, the role of ADAR1 was investigated in a mouse model of poly I:C-driven small intestine atrophy. RESULTS: Reduced ADAR1 expression was seen in duodenal biopsies compared to inactive CD and normal controls. Ex vivo organ cultures of duodenal mucosal biopsies, taken from inactive CD patients, stimulated with a peptic-tryptic digest of gliadin displayed a decreased expression of ADAR1. ADAR1 silencing in LPMC stimulated with a synthetic analogue of viral dsRNA strongly boosted the activation of IRF3 and IRF7 and the production of type-I IFN, TNF-α and IFN-γ. Administration of ADAR1 antisense but not sense oligonucleotide to mice with poly I:C-induced intestinal atrophy, significantly increased gut damage and inflammatory cytokines production. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that ADAR1 is an important regulator of intestinal immune homeostasis and demonstrate that defective ADAR1 expression could provide to amplifying pathogenic responses in CD intestinal mucosa.",2023,Front Immunol. 2023 May 8;14:1175348. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2023.1175348. eCollection 2023.,"['Di Fusco D', 'Segreto MT', 'Iannucci A', 'Maresca C', 'Franzè E', 'Di Maggio G', 'Di Grazia A', 'Boccanera S', 'Laudisi F', 'Marafini I', 'Paoluzi OA', 'Michenzi A', 'Monteleone G', 'Monteleone I']",False

The potential for CBD to ameliorate dimensional behavior symptoms occurring in multiple psychiatric disorders was suggested, including social interaction impairments. To test this hypothesis, adult male BTBRT+Itpr3tf/J (BTBR) mice, a model of idiopathic autism exhibiting social preference deficits and restrictive repetitive behaviors, were acutely treated with vehicle or 0.1, 1, or 10 mg/kg CBD. Social interaction preference was assessed 50 min after treatment, followed by social novelty preference at 60 min, marble burying at 75 min and social dominance at 120 min. CBD (10 mg/kg) enhanced BTBR social interaction but not social novelty preference, marble burying or dominance, with serum levels = 29 ± 11 ng/mg at 3 h post-injection. Next, acute 10 mg/kg CBD was compared to vehicle treatment in male serotonin transporter (SERT) knock-out mice, since SERT deficiency is an autism risk factor, and in their wildtype background strain controls C57BL/6J mice. CBD treatment generally enhanced social interaction preference and attenuated social novelty preference, yet neither marble burying nor dominance was affected. These findings show acute treatment with as little as 10 mg/kg purified CBD can enhance social interaction preference in male mice that are otherwise socially deficient.",2023,Adv Drug Alcohol Res. 2023;3:11163. doi: 10.3389/adar.2023.11163.

36290689,Epitranscriptome Analysis of Oxidative Stressed Retinal Epithelial Cells Depicted a Possible RNA Editing Landscape of Retinal Degeneration.,"Oxidative stress represents one of the principal causes of inherited retinal dystrophies, with many related molecular mechanisms still unknown. We investigated the posttranscriptional RNA editing landscape of human retinal pigment epithelium cells (RPE) exposed to the oxidant agent N-retinylidene-N-retinyl ethanolamine (A2E) for 1 h, 2 h, 3 h and 6 h. Using a transcriptomic approach, refined with a specific multialgorithm pipeline, 62,880 already annotated and de novo RNA editing sites within about 3000 genes were identified among all samples. Approximately 19% of these RNA editing sites were found within 3' UTR, including sites common to all time points that were predicted to change the binding capacity of 359 miRNAs towards 9654 target genes. A2E exposure also determined significant gene expression differences in deaminase family ADAR, APOBEC and ADAT members, involved in canonical and tRNA editing events. On GO and KEGG enrichment analyses, genes that showed different RNA editing levels are mainly involved in pathways strongly linked to a possible neovascularization of retinal tissue, with induced apoptosis mediated by the ECM and surface protein altered signaling. Collectively, this work demonstrated dynamic RNA editome profiles in RPE cells for the first time and shed more light on new mechanisms at the basis of retinal degeneration.",2022 Sep 30,Antioxidants (Basel). 2022 Sep 30;11(10):1967. doi: 10.3390/antiox11101967.,"['Donato L', 'Scimone C', 'Alibrandi S', 'Scalinci SZ', 'Rinaldi C', ""D'Angelo R"", 'Sidoti A']",False
36127363,Adar-mediated A-to-I editing is required for embryonic patterning and innate immune response regulation in zebrafish.,"Adenosine deaminases (ADARs) catalyze the deamination of adenosine to inosine, also known as A-to-I editing, in RNA. Although A-to-I editing occurs widely across animals and is well studied, new biological roles are still being discovered. Here, we study the role of A-to-I editing in early zebrafish development. We demonstrate that Adar, the zebrafish orthologue of mammalian ADAR1, is essential for establishing the antero-posterior and dorso-ventral axes and patterning. Genome-wide editing discovery reveals pervasive editing in maternal and the earliest zygotic transcripts, the majority of which occurred in the 3'-UTR. Interestingly, transcripts implicated in gastrulation as well as dorso-ventral and antero-posterior patterning are found to contain multiple editing sites. Adar knockdown or overexpression affect gene expression by 12 hpf. Analysis of adar-/- zygotic mutants further reveals that the previously described role of Adar in mammals in regulating the innate immune response is conserved in zebrafish. Our study therefore establishes distinct maternal and zygotic functions of RNA editing by Adar in embryonic patterning along the zebrafish antero-posterior and dorso-ventral axes, and in the regulation of the innate immune response, respectively.",2022 Sep 20,Nat Commun. 2022 Sep 20;13(1):5520. doi: 10.1038/s41467-022-33260-6.,"['Niescierowicz K', 'Pryszcz L', 'Navarrete C', 'Tralle E', 'Sulej A', 'Abu Nahia K', 'Kasprzyk ME', 'Misztal K', 'Pateria A', 'Pakuła A', 'Bochtler M', 'Winata C']",False
36115937,GBP2 acts as a member of the interferon signalling pathway in lupus nephritis.,"Lupus nephritis (LN) is a common and serious clinical manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus. However, the pathogenesis of LN is not fully understood. The currently available treatments do not cure the disease and appear to have a variety of side effects in the long term. The purpose of this study was to search for key molecules involved in the LN immune response through bioinformatics techniques to provide a reference for LN-specific targeted therapy. The GSE112943 dataset was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, and 20 of the samples were selected for analysis. In total, 2330 differentially expressed genes were screened. These genes were intersected with a list of immune genes obtained from the IMMPORT immune database to obtain 128 differentially expressed immune-related genes. Enrichment analysis showed that most of these genes were enriched in the interferon signalling pathway. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that the sample was significantly enriched for expression of the interferon signalling pathway. Further analysis of the core gene cluster showed that nine genes, GBP2, VCAM1, ADAR, IFITM1, BST2, MX2, IRF5, OAS1 and TRIM22, were involved in the interferon signalling pathway. According to our analysis, the guanylate binding protein 2 (GBP2), interferon regulatory factor 5 and 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1) genes are involved in three interferon signalling pathways. At present, we do not know whether GBP2 is associated with LN. Therefore, this study focused on the relationship between GBP2 and LN pathogenesis. We speculate that GBP2 may play a role in the pathogenesis of LN as a member of the interferon signalling pathway. Further immunohistochemical results showed that the expression of GBP2 was increased in the renal tissues of LN patients compared with the control group, confirming this conjecture. In conclusion, GBP2 is a member of the interferon signalling pathway that may have implications for the pathogenesis of LN and serves as a potential biomarker for LN.",2022 Sep 17,BMC Immunol. 2022 Sep 17;23(1):44. doi: 10.1186/s12865-022-00520-5.,"['Zhang Y', 'Liao Y', 'Hang Q', 'Sun D', 'Liu Y']",True
36000401,ADAR1 Prevents Autoinflammatory Processes in the Heart Mediated by IRF7.,"BACKGROUND: ADAR1 (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA-1)-mediated adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing plays an essential role for distinguishing endogenous from exogenous RNAs, preventing autoinflammatory ADAR1 also regulates cellular processes by recoding specific mRNAs, thereby altering protein functions, but may also act in an editing-independent manner. The specific role of ADAR1 in cardiomyocytes and its mode of action in the heart is not fully understood. To determine the role of ADAR1 in the heart, we used different mutant mouse strains, which allows to distinguish immunogenic, editing-dependent, and editing-independent functions of ADAR1. METHODS: Different Adar1-mutant mouse strains were employed for gene deletion or specific inactivation of ADAR1 enzymatic activity in cardiomyocytes, either alone or in combination with Ifih1 (interferon induced with helicase C domain 1) or Irf7 (interferon regulatory factor 7) gene inactivation. Mutant mice were investigated by immunofluorescence, Western blot, RNAseq, proteomics, and functional MRI analysis. RESULTS: Inactivation of Adar1 in cardiomyocytes resulted in late-onset autoinflammatory myocarditis progressing into dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure at 6 months of age. Adar1 depletion activated interferon signaling genes but not NFκB (nuclear factor kappa B) signaling or apoptosis and reduced cardiac hypertrophy during pressure overload via induction of Irf7. Additional inactivation of the cytosolic RNA sensor MDA5 (melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5; encoded by the Ifih1 gene) in Adar1 mutant mice prevented activation of interferon signaling gene and delayed heart failure but did not prevent lethality after 8.5 months. In contrast, compound mutants only expressing catalytically inactive ADAR1 in an Ifih1-mutant background were completely normal. Inactivation of Irf7 attenuated the phenotype of Adar1-deficient cardiomyocytes to a similar extent as Ifih1 depletion, identifying IRF7 as the main mediator of autoinflammatory responses caused by the absence of ADAR1 in cardiomyocytes. CONCLUSIONS: Enzymatically active ADAR1 prevents IRF7-mediated autoinflammatory reactions in the heart triggered by endogenous nonedited RNAs. In addition to RNA editing, ADAR1 also serves editing-independent roles in the heart required for long-term cardiac function and survival.",2022 Sep 16,Circ Res. 2022 Sep 16;131(7):580-597. doi: 10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.122.320839.

35977796,RNA-Editing Enzyme ADAR1 p150 Isoform Is Critical for Germinal Center B Cell Response.,"Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR)1 is the principal enzyme for adenosine-to-inosine editing, an RNA modification-avoiding cytosolic nucleic acid sensor's activation triggered by endogenous dsRNAs. Two ADAR1 isoforms exist in mammals, a longer IFN-inducible and mainly cytoplasm-localized p150 isoform and a shorter constitutively expressed and primarily nucleus-localized p110 isoform. Studies of ADAR1 mutant mice have demonstrated that ADAR1 is essential for multiple physiological processes, including embryonic development, innate immune response, and B and T lymphocyte development. However, it remained unknown whether ADAR1 plays a role in the humoral immune response. In this study, we conditionally delete Adar1 in activated B cells and show that ADAR1-deficient mice have a defective T cell-dependent Ab response and diminished germinal center (GC) B cells. Using various double mutant mice concurrently deficient in ADAR1 and different downstream dsRNA sensors, we demonstrate that ADAR1 regulates the GC response by preventing hyperactivation of the melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) but not the protein kinase R or RNase L pathway. We also show that p150 is exclusively responsible for ADAR1's function in the GC response, and the p110 isoform cannot substitute for the p150's role, even when p110 is constitutively expressed in the cytoplasm. We further demonstrated that the dsRNA-binding but not the RNA-editing activity is required for ADAR1's function in the GC response. Thus, our data suggest that the ADAR1 p150 isoform plays a crucial role in regulating the GC B cell response.",2022 Sep 15,J Immunol. 2022 Sep 15;209(6):1071-1082. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.2200149.

36109586,U-to-C RNA editing by synthetic PPR-DYW proteins in bacteria and human culture cells.,"Programmable RNA editing offers significant therapeutic potential for a wide range of genetic diseases. Currently, several deaminase enzymes, including ADAR and APOBEC, can perform programmable adenosine-to-inosine or cytidine-to-uridine RNA correction. However, enzymes to perform guanosine-to-adenosine and uridine-to-cytidine (U-to-C) editing are still lacking to complete the set of transition reactions. It is believed that the DYW:KP proteins, specific to seedless plants, catalyze the U-to-C reactions in mitochondria and chloroplasts. In this study, we designed seven DYW:KP domains based on consensus sequences and fused them to a designer RNA-binding pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) domain. We show that three of these PPR-DYW:KP proteins edit targeted uridine to cytidine in bacteria and human cells. In addition, we show that these proteins have a 5' but not apparent 3' preference for neighboring nucleotides.

35975999,"Evidence against the Human Metapneumovirus G, SH, and M2-2 Proteins as Bona Fide Interferon Antagonists.","The production of type I interferon (IFN) is the hallmark of the innate immune response. Most, if not all, mammalian viruses have a way to circumvent this response. Fundamental knowledge on viral evasion of innate immune responses may facilitate the design of novel antiviral therapies. To investigate how human metapneumovirus (HMPV) interacts with the innate immune response, recombinant viruses lacking G, short hydrophobic (SH), or M2-2 protein expression were assessed for IFN induction in A549 cells. HMPV lacking G or SH protein expression induced similarly low levels of IFN, compared to the wild-type virus, whereas HMPV lacking M2-2 expression induced significantly more IFN than the wild-type virus. However, sequence analysis of the genomes of M2-2 mutant viruses revealed large numbers of mutations throughout the genome. Over 70% of these nucleotide substitutions were A-to-G and T-to-C mutations, consistent with the properties of the adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) protein family. Knockdown of ADAR1 by CRISPR interference confirmed the role of ADAR1 in the editing of M2-2 deletion mutant virus genomes. More importantly, Northern blot analyses revealed the presence of defective interfering RNAs (DIs) in M2-2 mutant viruses and not in the wild-type virus or G and SH deletion mutant viruses. DIs are known to be potent inducers of the IFN response. The presence of DIs in M2-2 mutant virus stocks and hypermutated virus genomes interfere with studies on HMPV and the innate immune response and should be addressed in future studies. IMPORTANCE Understanding the interaction between viruses and the innate immune response is one of the barriers to the design of antiviral therapies. Here, we investigated the role of the G, SH, and M2-2 proteins of HMPV as type I IFN antagonists. In contrast to other studies, no IFN-antagonistic functions could be observed for the G and SH proteins. HMPV with a deletion of the M2-2 protein did induce type I IFN production upon infection of airway epithelial cells. However, during generation of virus stocks, these viruses rapidly accumulated DIs, which are strong activators of the type I IFN response. Additionally, the genomes of these viruses were hypermutated, which was prevented by generating stocks in ADAR knockdown cells, confirming a role for ADAR in hypermutation of HMPV genomes or DIs. These data indicate that a role of the HMPV M2-2 protein as a bona fide IFN antagonist remains elusive.",2022 Sep 14,J Virol. 2022 Sep 14;96(17):e0072322. doi: 10.1128/jvi.00723-22.

Although amniotic membrane (AM) and Wharton's jelly (WJ)-derived MSCs have been widely shown to possess osteogenic differentiation potential, the intrinsic properties determining their osteogenic capacity remain unclear. Here, we compared gene expression profiles of AM- and WJ-MSCs at basal and osteogenic conditions by using the NanoString Stem Cell Panel containing regulatory genes associated with stemness, self-renewal, Wnt, Notch and Hedgehog signalling pathways. At basal condition, WJ-MSCs displayed higher expression in most genes regardless of their functional roles in self-renewal, adhesion, or differentiation signalling pathways. After osteo-induction, elevated expression of self-renewal genes ADAR and PAFAH1B1 was observed in AM-MSCs, while stemness genes MME and ALDH1A1 were upregulated in WJ-MSC. Both MSCs showed differences in genes associated with ligands, receptors and ubiquitin ligases of the Notch pathway. In addition, further evidence was demonstrated in some signalling molecules including CTBPs, protein kinases, phosphatases, RHOA, RAC1. Downstream targets HES1 and JUN especially showed higher expression in non-induced WJ-MSCs. Hedgehog genes initially expressed in both MSCs were downregulated in WJ-MSCs during osteogenesis.

Here, we report that preexposure of melanoma cells to cognate T cells enhanced the chemotaxis of new T cells in vitro. The effect was HLA class I-restricted and IFNγ-dependent, as it was abolished by β2M-knockdown, MHC-blocking antibodies, JAK1 inhibitors, JAK1-silencing and IFNgR1-blocking antibodies. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of 73 melanoma metastases showed a significant correlation between the interferon-inducible p150 isoform of adenosine-deaminase-acting-on-RNA-1 (ADAR1) enzyme and immune infiltration. Consistent with this, cocultures of cognate melanoma/T-cell pairs led to IFNγ-dependent induction of ADAR1-p150 in the melanoma cells, as visualized in situ using dynamic cell blocks, in ovo using fertilized chick eggs, and in vitro with Western blots. ADAR1 staining and RNA-seq in patient-derived biopsies following immunotherapy showed a rise in ADAR1-p150 expression concurrently with CD8+ cell infiltration and clinical response. Silencing ADAR1-p150 abolished the IFNγ-driven enhanced T-cell migration, confirming its mechanistic role. Silencing and overexpression of the constitutive isoform of ADAR1, ADAR1-p110, decreased and increased T-cell migration, respectively. Chemokine arrays showed that ADAR1 controls the secretion of multiple chemokines from melanoma cells, probably through microRNA-mediated regulation. Chemokine receptor blockade eliminated the IFNγ-driven T-cell chemotaxis. We propose that the constitutive ADAR1 downregulation observed in melanoma contributes to immune exclusion, whereas antigen-specific T cells induce ADAR1-p150 by releasing IFNγ, which can drive T-cell infiltration.",2022 Sep 1,Cancer Immunol Res. 2022 Sep 1;10(9):1127-1140. doi: 10.1158/2326-6066.CIR-21-0643.,"['Margolis N', 'Moalem H', 'Meirson T', 'Galore-Haskel G', 'Markovits E', 'Baruch EN', 'Vizel B', 'Yeffet A', 'Kanterman-Rifman J', 'Debby A', 'Besser MJ', 'Schachter J', 'Markel G']",True

As no established drugs are available against SARS-CoV-2 and developing new ones would be a big challenge, repurposing of existing drugs holds promise against COVID-19. Here, we used a signature-based strategy to delve into cellular responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection in order to identify potential host contributors in COVID-19 pathogenesis and to find repurposable drugs using in silico approaches. We scrutinized transcriptomic profile of various human alveolar cell sources infected with SARS-CoV-2 to determine up-regulated genes specific to COVID-19.

35779766,Methods for recruiting endogenous and exogenous ADAR enzymes for site-specific RNA editing.,"Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) can be repurposed to achieve site-specific A-to-I RNA editing by recruiting them to a target of interest via an ADAR-recruiting guide RNA (adRNA). In this chapter, we present details towards experimental methods to enable this via two orthogonal strategies: one, via recruitment of endogenous ADARs (i.e. ADARs already natively expressed in cells); and two, via recruitment of exogenous ADARs (i.e. ADARs delivered into cells). Towards the former, we describe the use of circular adRNAs to recruit endogenous ADARs to a desired mRNA target. This results in robust, persistent and highly transcript specific editing both in vitro and in vivo. Towards the latter, we describe the use of a split-ADAR2 system, which allows for overexpression of ADAR2 variants that can be utilized to edit adenosines with high specificity, including at challenging to edit adenosines in non-preferred motifs such as those flanked by a 5' guanosine. We anticipate the described methods should facilitate RNA editing applications across research and biotechnology settings.",2022 Sep,Methods. 2022 Sep;205:158-166. doi: 10.1016/j.ymeth.2022.06.011.

35850307,RNA binding by ADAR3 inhibits adenosine-to-inosine editing and promotes expression of immune response protein MAVS.,"Members of the ADAR family of double-stranded RNA-binding proteins regulate one of the most abundant RNA modifications in humans, the deamination of adenosine to inosine. Several transcriptome-wide studies have been carried out to identify RNA targets of the active deaminases ADAR1 and ADAR2. However, our understanding of ADAR3, the brain-specific deaminase-deficient ADAR family member, is limited to a few transcripts. In this study, we identified over 3300 transcripts bound by ADAR3 and observed that binding of ADAR3 correlated with reduced editing of over 400 sites in the glioblastoma transcriptome. We further investigated the impact of ADAR3 on gene regulation of the transcript that encodes MAVS, an essential protein in the innate immune response pathway. We observed reduced editing in the MAVS 3' UTR in cells expressing increased ADAR3 or reduced ADAR1 suggesting ADAR3 acts as a negative regulator of ADAR1-mediated editing. While neither ADAR1 knockdown or ADAR3 overexpression affected MAVS mRNA expression, we demonstrate increased ADAR3 expression resulted in upregulation of MAVS protein expression. In addition, we created a novel genetic mutant of ADAR3 that exhibited enhanced RNA binding and MAVS upregulation compared with wildtype ADAR3. Interestingly, this ADAR3 mutant no longer repressed RNA editing, suggesting ADAR3 has a unique regulatory role beyond altering editing levels. Altogether, this study provides the first global view of ADAR3-bound RNAs in glioblastoma cells and identifies both a role for ADAR3 in repressing ADAR1-mediated editing and an RNA-binding dependent function of ADAR3 in regulating MAVS expression.",2022 Sep,J Biol Chem. 2022 Sep;298(9):102267. doi: 10.1016/j.jbc.2022.102267.

36243986,ADAR activation by inducing a syn conformation at guanosine adjacent to an editing site.,"ADARs (adenosine deaminases acting on RNA) can be directed to sites in the transcriptome by complementary guide strands allowing for the correction of disease-causing mutations at the RNA level. However, ADARs show bias against editing adenosines with a guanosine 5' nearest neighbor (5'-GA sites), limiting the scope of this approach. Earlier studies suggested this effect arises from a clash in the RNA minor groove involving the 2-amino group of the guanosine adjacent to an editing site. Here we show that nucleosides capable of pairing with guanosine in a syn conformation enhance editing for 5'-GA sites. We describe the crystal structure of a fragment of human ADAR2 bound to RNA bearing a G:G pair adjacent to an editing site. The two guanosines form a Gsyn:Ganti pair solving the steric problem by flipping the 2-amino group of the guanosine adjacent to the editing site into the major groove. Also, duplexes with 2'-deoxyadenosine and 3-deaza-2'-deoxyadenosine displayed increased editing efficiency, suggesting the formation of a Gsyn:AH+anti pair. This was supported by X-ray crystallography of an ADAR complex with RNA bearing a G:3-deaza dA pair. This study shows how non-Watson-Crick pairing in duplex RNA can facilitate ADAR editing enabling the design of next generation guide strands for therapeutic RNA editing.",2022 Oct 28,Nucleic Acids Res. 2022 Oct 28;50(19):10857-10868. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkac897.,"['Doherty EE', 'Karki A', 'Wilcox XE', 'Mendoza HG', 'Manjunath A', 'Matos VJ', 'Fisher AJ', 'Beal PA']",True
36102513,Uncovering Cis-Regulatory Elements Important for A-to-I RNA Editing in Fusarium graminearum.,"Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing independent of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) enzymes was discovered in fungi recently, and shown to be crucial for sexual reproduction. However, the underlying mechanism for editing is unknown. Here, we combine genome-wide comparisons, proof-of-concept experiments, and machine learning to decipher cis-regulatory elements of A-to-I editing in Fusarium graminearum. We identified plenty of RNA primary sequences and secondary structural features that affect editing specificity and efficiency. Although hairpin loop structures contribute importantly to editing, unlike in animals, the primary sequences have more profound influences on editing than secondary structures. Nucleotide preferences at adjacent positions of editing sites are the most important features, especially preferences at the -1 position. Unexpectedly, besides the number of positions with preferred nucleotides, the combination of preferred nucleotides with depleted ones at different positions are also important for editing. Some cis-sequence features have distinct importance for editing specificity and efficiency. Machine learning models built from diverse sequence and secondary structural features can accurately predict genome-wide editing sites but not editing levels, indicating that the cis-regulatory principle of editing efficiency is more complex than that of editing specificity. Nevertheless, our model interpretation provides insights into the quantitative contribution of each feature to the prediction of both editing sites and levels. We found that efficient editing of FG3G34330 transcripts depended on the full-length RNA molecule, suggesting that additional RNA structural elements may also contribute to editing efficiency. Our work uncovers multidimensional cis-regulatory elements important for A-to-I RNA editing in F. graminearum, helping to elucidate the fungal editing mechanism. IMPORTANCE A-to-I RNA editing is a new epigenetic phenomenon that is crucial for sexual reproduction in fungi. Deciphering cis-regulatory elements of A-to-I RNA editing can help us elucidate the editing mechanism and develop a model that accurately predicts RNA editing. In this study, we discovered multiple RNA sequence and secondary structure features important for A-to-I editing in Fusarium graminearum. We also identified the cis-sequence features with distinct importance for editing specificity and efficiency.

The present research was aimed to explore the protective function of ADAR1, an RNA editing enzyme, against inflammatory damages in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD through inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome and subsequent inflammation. A total of 30 patients with NAFLD were investigated, and ADAR1 mRNA expression in peripheral blood monocytes surveyed. The in vivo study used lentivirus to explore the function of ADAR1 overexpression in the HFD-induced mouse model of NAFLD. The in vitro study used lentivirus and siRNA to explore the function of ADAR1 on the NLRP3 inflammasome activation in THP-1 cells. Results shown that the ADAR1 expression was upregulated in NAFLD patients in comparison to healthy controls. In vivo, the upregulation of ADAR1 impaired NLRP3 inflammasome activation and alleviated liver disease in HFD mice in comparison to the control group. Moreover, ADAR1 overexpression attenuated NLRP3 inflammasome in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)+ palmitic acid (PA)-induced THP-1 cells, while ADAR1 knockdown increased the NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Furthermore, we speculated that c-Jun may participate in ADAR1's inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome.

36068334,CPEB3 suppresses gastric cancer progression by inhibiting ADAR1-mediated RNA editing via localizing ADAR1 mRNA to P bodies.,"Deciphering the crosstalk between RNA-binding proteins and corresponding RNAs will provide a better understanding of gastric cancer (GC) progression. The comprehensive bioinformatics study identified cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein 3 (CPEB3) might play a vital role in GC progression. Then we found CPEB3 was downregulated in GC and correlated with prognosis. In addition, CPEB3 suppressed GC cell proliferation, invasion and migration in vitro, as well as tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Mechanistic study demonstrated CPEB3 interacted with 3'-UTR of ADAR1 mRNA through binding to CPEC nucleotide element, and then inhibited its translation by localizing it to processing bodies (P bodies), eventually leading to the suppression of ADAR1-mediated RNA editing. Microscale thermophoresis assay further revealed that the direct interaction between CPEB3 and GW182, the P-body's major component, was through the 440-698AA region of CPEB3 binding to the 403-860AA region of GW182. Finally, AAV9-CPEB3 was developed and administrated in mouse models to assess its potential value in gene therapy. We found AAV9-CPEB3 inhibited GC growth and metastasis. Besides, AAV9-CPEB3 induced hydropic degeneration in mouse liver, but did not cause kidney damage.

36252997,Immunosuppressive lncRNA LINC00624 promotes tumor progression and therapy resistance through ADAR1 stabilization.,"BACKGROUND: Despite the success of HER2-targeted therapy in achieving prolonged survival in approximately 50% of treated individuals, treatment resistance is still an important challenge for HER2+ breast cancer (BC) patients. The influence of both adaptive and innate immune responses on the therapeutic outcomes of HER2+BC patients has been extensively demonstrated. METHODS: Long non-coding RNAs expressed in non-pathological complete response (pCR) HER2 positive BC were screened and validated by RNA-seq. Survival analysis were made by Kaplan-Meier method. Cell death assay and proliferation assay were performed to confirm the phenotype of LINC00624. RT-qPCR and western blot were used to assay the IFN response. Xenograft mouse model were used for in vivo confirmation of anti-neu treatment resistance. RNA pull-down and immunoblot were used to confirm the interaction of ADAR1 and LINC00624. ADAR1 recombinant protein were purified from baculovirus expression system. B16-OVA cells were used to study antigen presentation both in vitro and in vivo. Flow cytometry was used to determine the tumor infiltrated immune cells of xenograft model. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) were used for in vivo treatment. RESULTS: In this study, we found that LINC00624 blocked the antitumor effect of HER2- targeted therapy both in vitro and in vivo by inhibiting type I interferon (IFN) pathway activation. The double-stranded RNA-like structure of LINC00624 can bind and be edited by the adenosine (A) to inosine (I) RNA-editing enzyme adenosine deaminase RNA specific 1 (ADAR1), and this editing has been shown to release the growth inhibition and attenuate the innate immune response caused by the IFN response. Notably, LINC00624 promoted the stabilization of ADAR1 by inhibiting its ubiquitination-induced degradation triggered by β-TrCP. In contrast, LINC00624 inhibited major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigen presentation and limited CD8+T cell infiltration in the cancer microenvironment, resulting in immune checkpoint blockade inhibition and anti-HER2 treatment resistance mediated through ADAR1.

ADAR1 exerts its requisite role via both MDA5-dependent and -independent pathways. Interestingly, the MDA5-dependent mechanisms regulate early pro-B to large pre-B cell transition by promoting early B cell survival. In contrast, the MDA5-independent mechanisms control large pre-B to small pre-B cell transition by regulating pre-B cell receptor (pre-BCR) expression. Moreover, we show that protein kinase R (PKR) and oligoadenylate synthetase/ribonuclease (OAS/RNase) L pathways are dispensable for ADAR1's role in early B lymphopoiesis. Importantly, we demonstrate that p150 isoform of ADAR1 exclusively accounts for ADAR1's function in early B lymphopoiesis, and its conventional dsRNA-binding, but not the Z-DNA/RNA-binding or the RNA-editing, activity is required for ADAR1's function in B cell development.

In addition, we investigated the evolutionary status of the chicken editome as a potential mechanism of domestication. We detected the lowest editing level in the liver of chickens, compared to muscles in humans, and found higher editing activity and specificity in the brain than in non-neural tissues, consistent with the brain's functional complexity. To a certain extent, specific editing activity may account for the specific functions of tissues. Our results also revealed that sequences critical to RES secondary structures remained conserved within avian evolution. Furthermore, the RNA editome was shaped by purifying selection during chicken domestication and most RESs may have served as a selection pool for a few functional RESs involved in chicken domestication, including evolution of nervous and immune systems.

We have analyzed in silico data from microglia isolated at different timepoints through disease progression to identify the global editing events and validated the selected targets in murine tissue samples. To further evaluate the functional role of RNA editing, we induced EAE in transgenic animals lacking expression of APOBEC-1. We found that RNA-editing events, mediated by the APOBEC and ADAR deaminases, are significantly reduced throughout the course of disease, possibly affecting the protein expression necessary for normal neurological function. Moreover, the severity of the EAE model was significantly higher in APOBEC-1 knock-out mice, compared to wild-type controls. Our results implicate regulatory epitranscriptomic mechanisms in EAE pathogenesis that could be extrapolated to MS and other neurodegenerative disorders (NDs) with common clinical and molecular features.",2022 Nov 12,Cells. 2022 Nov 12;11(22):3582. doi: 10.3390/cells11223582.,"['Dafou D', 'Kanata E', 'Pettas S', 'Bekas N', 'Dimitriadis A', 'Kempapidou G', 'Lagoudaki R', 'Theotokis P', 'Touloumi O', 'Delivanoglou N', 'Kesidou E', 'Xanthopoulos K', 'Grigoriadis N', 'Papavasiliou FN', 'Sklaviadis T']",False
36316318,The snoRNA-like lncRNA LNC-SNO49AB drives leukemia by activating the RNA-editing enzyme ADAR1.,"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are usually 5' capped and 3' polyadenylated, similar to most typical mRNAs. However, recent studies revealed a type of snoRNA-related lncRNA with unique structures, leading to questions on how they are processed and how they work. Here, we identify a novel snoRNA-related lncRNA named LNC-SNO49AB containing two C/D box snoRNA sequences, SNORD49A and SNORD49B; and show that LNC-SNO49AB represents an unreported type of lncRNA with a 5'-end m7G and a 3'-end snoRNA structure. LNC-SNO49AB was found highly expressed in leukemia patient samples, and silencing LNC-SNO49AB dramatically suppressed leukemia progression in vitro and in vivo. Subcellular location indicated that the LNC-SNO49AB is mainly located in nucleolus and interacted with the nucleolar protein fibrillarin. However, we found that LNC-SNO49AB does not play a role in 2'-O-methylation regulation, a classical function of snoRNA; instead, its snoRNA structure affected the lncRNA stability. We further demonstrated that LNC-SNO49AB could directly bind to the adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1(ADAR1) and promoted its homodimerization followed by a high RNA A-to-I editing activity. Transcriptome profiling shows that LNC-SNO49AB and ADAR1 knockdown respectively share very similar patterns of RNA modification change in downstream signaling pathways, especially in cell cycle pathways. These findings suggest a previously unknown class of snoRNA-related lncRNAs, which function via a manner in nucleolus independently on snoRNA-guide rRNA modification. This is the first report that a lncRNA regulates genome-wide RNA A-to-I editing by enhancing ADAR1 dimerization to facilitate hematopoietic malignancy, suggesting that LNC-SNO49AB may be a novel target in therapy directed to leukemia.",2022 Nov 1,Cell Discov. 2022 Nov 1;8(1):117. doi: 10.1038/s41421-022-00460-9.,"['Huang W', 'Sun YM', 'Pan Q', 'Fang K', 'Chen XT', 'Zeng ZC', 'Chen TQ', 'Zhu SX', 'Huang LB', 'Luo XQ', 'Wang WT', 'Chen YQ']",False
36036447,How RNA editing keeps an I on physiology.,"Adenosine deaminases acting on RNAs convert adenosines (A) to inosines (I) in structured or double-stranded RNAs. In mammals, this process is widespread. In the human transcriptome, more than a million different sites have been identified that undergo an ADAR-mediated A-to-I exchange Inosines have an altered base pairing potential due to the missing amino group when compared to the original adenosine. Consequently, inosines prefer to base pair with cytosines but can also base pair with uracil or adenine. This altered base pairing potential not only affects protein decoding at the ribosome but also influences the folding of RNAs and the proteins that can associate with it. Consequently, an A to I exchange can also affect RNA processing and turnover (Nishikura K. Annu Rev Biochem 79: 321-349, 2010; Brümmer A, Yang Y, Chan TW, Xiao X. Nat Commun 8: 1255, 2017). All of these events will interfere with gene expression and therefore, can also affect cellular and organismic physiology. As double-stranded RNAs are a hallmark of viral pathogens RNA-editing not only affects RNA-processing, coding, and gene expression but also controls the antiviral response to double-stranded RNAs. Most interestingly, recent advances in our understanding of ADAR enzymes reveal multiple layers of regulation by which ADARs can control antiviral programs. In this review, we focus on the recoding of mRNAs where the altered translation products lead to physiological changes. We also address recent advances in our understanding of the multiple layers of antiviral responses and innate immune modulations mediated by ADAR1.",2022 Nov 1,Am J Physiol Cell Physiol. 2022 Nov 1;323(5):C1496-C1511. doi: 10.1152/ajpcell.00191.2022.

36150525,The role of Actopaxin in tumor metastasis.,"Actopaxin is a newly discovered focal adhesions (FAs) protein, actin-binding protein and pseudopodia-enriched molecule. It can not only bind to a variety of FAs proteins (such as Paxillin, ILK and PINCH) and non-FAs proteins (such as TESK1, CdGAP, β2-adaptin, G3BP2, ADAR1 and CD29), but also participates in multiple signaling pathways. Thus, it plays a crucial role in regulating important processes of tumor metastasis, including matrix degradation, migration, and invasion, etc. This review covers the latest progress in the structure and function of Actopaxin, its interaction with other proteins as well as its involvement in regulating tumor development and metastasis. Additionally, the current limitations for Actopaxin related studies and the possible research directions on it in the future are also discussed. It is hoped that this review can assist relevant researchers to obtain a deep understanding of the role that Actopaxin plays in tumor progression, and also enlighten further research and development of therapeutic approaches for the treatment of tumor metastasis.",2022 Nov,Prog Biophys Mol Biol. 2022 Nov;175:90-102. doi: 10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2022.09.006.

36165274,Z-nucleic acids: Uncovering the functions from past to present.,"Since Z-nucleic acid was identified in the 1970s, much is still unknown about its biological functions and nature in vivo. Recent studies on adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) and Z-DNA-binding protein 1 (ZBP1) have highlighted its function in immune responses. Specifically, Z-RNAs, either endogenous or induced by viral infection, are sensed by ZBP1 and activate necroptosis. Z-RNAs act as the stimuli that induce innate immune responses through various pathways, including melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MAD5)-mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS)-mediated type I IFN activation and proteinase kinase R (PKR)-dependent integrated stress response, and their immunostimulatory potential is curtailed by RNA editing conducted by ADAR1. Aberrant immune responses induced by Z-RNAs are associated with human diseases. They also induce pathogenesis in mice. Unlike Z-RNAs, the biological functions of Z-DNAs were barely studied, especially in mammals. Moreover, the origin or sequence preference of Z-nucleic acids requires further investigation. Such knowledge will expand our understanding of Z-nucleic acids, including from which genomic loci and under which circumstances they form, and the mechanisms by which they participate in the physiological activities.

36343976,Inhibiting DNA methylation and RNA editing upregulates immunogenic RNA to transform the tumor microenvironment and prolong survival in ovarian cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Novel therapies are urgently needed for ovarian cancer (OC), the fifth deadliest cancer in women. Preclinical work has shown that DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTis) can reverse the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment in OC. Inhibiting DNA methyltransferases activate transcription of double-stranded (ds)RNA, including transposable elements. These dsRNAs activate sensors in the cytoplasm and trigger type I interferon (IFN) signaling, recruiting host immune cells to kill the tumor cells. Adenosine deaminase 1 (ADAR1) is induced by IFN signaling and edits mammalian dsRNA with an A-to-I nucleotide change, which is read as an A-to-G change in sequencing data. These edited dsRNAs cannot be sensed by dsRNA sensors, and thus ADAR1 inhibits the type I IFN response in a negative feedback loop. We hypothesized that decreasing ADAR1 editing would enhance the DNMTi-induced immune response. METHODS: Human OC cell lines were treated in vitro with DNMTi and then RNA-sequenced to measure RNA editing. Adar1 was stably knocked down in ID8 Trp53(-/-) mouse OC cells. Control cells (shGFP) or shAdar1 cells were tested with mock or DNMTi treatment. Tumor-infiltrating immune cells were immunophenotyped using flow cytometry and cell culture supernatants were analyzed for secreted chemokines/cytokines. Mice were injected with syngeneic shAdar1 ID8 Trp53(-/-) cells and treated with tetrahydrouridine/DNMTi while given anti-interferon alpha and beta receptor 1, anti-CD8, or anti-NK1.1 antibodies every 3 days. RESULTS: We show that ADAR1 edits transposable elements in human OC cell lines after DNMTi treatment in vitro. Combining ADAR1 knockdown with DNMTi significantly increases pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine production and sensitivity to IFN-β compared with either perturbation alone. Furthermore, DNMTi treatment and Adar1 loss reduces tumor burden and prolongs survival in an immunocompetent mouse model of OC. Combining Adar1 loss and DNMTi elicited the most robust antitumor response and transformed the immune microenvironment with increased recruitment and activation of CD8+ T cells. CONCLUSION: In summary, we showed that the survival benefit from DNMTi plus ADAR1 inhibition is dependent on type I IFN signaling. Thus, epigenetically inducing transposable element transcription combined with inhibition of RNA editing is a novel therapeutic strategy to reverse immune evasion in OC, a disease that does not respond to current immunotherapies.",2022 Nov,J Immunother Cancer. 2022 Nov;10(11):e004974. doi: 10.1136/jitc-2022-004974.,"['Gomez S', 'Cox OL', 'Walker RR 3rd', 'Rentia U', 'Hadley M', 'Arthofer E', 'Diab N', 'Grundy EE', 'Kanholm T', 'McDonald JI', 'Kobyra J', 'Palmer E', 'Noonepalle S', 'Villagra A', 'Leitenberg D', 'Bollard CM', 'Saunthararajah Y', 'Chiappinelli KB']",False
36450382,Z-DNA enhances immunotherapy by triggering death of inflammatory cancer-associated fibroblasts.,"Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a heterogeneous population of cells. At one end of the spectrum are alpha-smooth muscle actin expressing myoCAFs (myofibroblast CAFs) and at the other end are the interferon (IFN) and Janus Kinase/Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription responsive iCAFs (inflammatory CAFs). Both types of CAFs promote tumor growth. While myoCAFs foster immune exclusion and limit tumor spread, iCAFs create a highly immunosuppressive environment and foster the seeding of distant metastases. However, iCAFs also represent a tumor vulnerability. They are competent to undergo necroptosis, a highly immunogenic form of cell death that is triggered when Z-DNA or Z-RNA (collectively called ZNA) is sensed by the IFN-induced ZNA binding protein 1 (ZBP1). The sequestering of ZNA ligands by the p150 isoform of the double-stranded RNA-specific deaminase ADAR1 protects iCAFs from cell death. ZBP1-dependent necroptosis in iCAFs can be triggered by administering an orally available small molecule that generates sufficient amounts of ZNA to bypass ADAR1 inhibition. The therapeutic approach of targeting Z-prone sequences (called flipons) is agnostic to the mutations driving cancer progression. By exploiting the tumor vulnerability posed by expression of ZBP1-dependent immunogenic cell death pathways in iCAFs, flipon therapeutics offer new hope for improved clinical outcomes.",2022 Nov,J Immunother Cancer. 2022 Nov;10(11):e005704. doi: 10.1136/jitc-2022-005704.,"['Herbert A', 'Balachandran S']",True
36282916,ADAR regulates APOL1 via A-to-I RNA editing by inhibition of MDA5 activation in a paradoxical biological circuit.,"APOL1 risk variants are associated with increased risk of kidney disease in patients of African ancestry, but not all individuals with the APOL1 high-risk genotype develop kidney disease. As APOL1 gene expression correlates closely with the degree of kidney cell injury in both cell and animal models, the mechanisms regulating APOL1 expression may be critical determinants of risk allele penetrance. The APOL1 messenger RNA includes Alu elements at the 3' untranslated region that can form a double-stranded RNA structure (Alu-dsRNA) susceptible to posttranscriptional adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR)-mediated adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing, potentially impacting gene expression. We studied the effects of ADAR expression and A-to-I editing on APOL1 levels in podocytes, human kidney tissue, and a transgenic APOL1 mouse model. In interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-stimulated human podocytes, ADAR down-regulates APOL1 by preventing melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) recognition of dsRNA and the subsequent type I interferon (IFN-I) response. Knockdown experiments showed that recognition of APOL1 messenger RNA itself is an important contributor to the MDA5-driven IFN-I response. Mathematical modeling suggests that the IFN-ADAR-APOL1 network functions as an incoherent feed-forward loop, a biological circuit capable of generating fast, transient responses to stimuli. Glomeruli from human kidney biopsies exhibited widespread editing of APOL1 Alu-dsRNA, while the transgenic mouse model closely replicated the edited sites in humans. APOL1 expression in mice was inversely correlated with Adar1 expression under IFN-γ stimuli, supporting the idea that ADAR regulates APOL1 levels in vivo. ADAR-mediated A-to-I editing is an important regulator of APOL1 expression that could impact both penetrance and severity of APOL1-associated kidney disease.",2022 Nov,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2022 Nov;119(44):e2210150119. doi: 10.1073/pnas.2210150119.

36509721,Proteomic Analysis of Zebrafish Protein Recoding via mRNA Editing by ADAR Enzymes.,"RNA editing by adenosine deaminases of the ADAR family can lead to protein recoding, since inosine formed from adenosine in mRNA is complementary to cytosine; the resulting codon editing might introduce amino acid substitutions into translated proteins. Proteome recoding can have functional consequences which have been described in many animals including humans. Using protein recoding database derived from publicly available transcriptome data, we identified for the first time the recoding sites in the zebrafish shotgun proteomes. Out of more than a hundred predicted recoding events, ten substitutions were found in six used datasets. Seven of them were in the AMPA glutamate receptor subunits, whose recoding has been well described, and are conserved among vertebrates. Three sites were specific for zebrafish proteins and were found in the transmembrane receptors astrotactin 1 and neuregulin 3b (proteins involved in the neuronal adhesion and signaling) and in the rims2b gene product (presynaptic membrane protein participating in the neurotransmitter release), respectively.

35563631,Interplay between A-to-I Editing and Splicing of RNA: A Potential Point of Application for Cancer Therapy.,"Adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing is a system of post-transcriptional modification widely distributed in metazoans which is catalyzed by ADAR enzymes and occurs mostly in double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) before splicing. This type of RNA editing changes the genetic code, as inosine generally pairs with cytosine in contrast to adenosine, and this expectably modulates RNA splicing. We review the interconnections between RNA editing and splicing in the context of human cancer. The editing of transcripts may have various effects on splicing, and resultant alternatively spliced isoforms may be either tumor-suppressive or oncogenic. Dysregulated RNA splicing in cancer often causes the release of excess amounts of dsRNA into cytosol, where specific dsRNA sensors provoke antiviral-like responses, including type I interferon signaling. These responses may arrest cell division, causing apoptosis and, externally, stimulate antitumor immunity. Thus, small-molecule spliceosome inhibitors have been shown to facilitate the antiviral-like signaling and are considered to be potential cancer therapies. In turn, a cytoplasmic isoform of ADAR can deaminate dsRNA in cytosol, thereby decreasing its levels and diminishing antitumor innate immunity. We propose that complete or partial inhibition of ADAR may enhance the proapoptotic and cytotoxic effects of splicing inhibitors and that it may be considered a promising addition to cancer therapies targeting RNA splicing.",2022 May 8,Int J Mol Sci. 2022 May 8;23(9):5240. doi: 10.3390/ijms23095240.,"['Goncharov AO', 'Shender VO', 'Kuznetsova KG', 'Kliuchnikova AA', 'Moshkovskii SA']",True
35523818,Regulation of A-to-I RNA editing and stop codon recoding to control selenoprotein expression during skeletal myogenesis.,"Selenoprotein N (SELENON), a selenocysteine (Sec)-containing protein with high reductive activity, maintains redox homeostasis, thereby contributing to skeletal muscle differentiation and function. Loss-of-function mutations in SELENON cause severe neuromuscular disorders. In the early-to-middle stage of myoblast differentiation, SELENON maintains redox homeostasis and modulates endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca(2+) concentration, resulting in a gradual reduction from the middle-to-late stages due to unknown mechanisms. The present study describes post-transcriptional mechanisms that regulate SELENON expression during myoblast differentiation. Part of an Alu element in the second intron of SELENON pre-mRNA is frequently exonized during splicing, resulting in an aberrant mRNA that is degraded by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). In the middle stage of myoblast differentiation, ADAR1-mediated A-to-I RNA editing occurs in the U1 snRNA binding site at 5' splice site, preventing Alu exonization and producing mature mRNA. In the middle-to-late stage of myoblast differentiation, the level of Sec-charged tRNA(Sec) decreases due to downregulation of essential recoding factors for Sec insertion, thereby generating a premature termination codon in SELENON mRNA, which is targeted by NMD.",2022 May 6,Nat Commun. 2022 May 6;13(1):2503. doi: 10.1038/s41467-022-30181-2.,"['Noda Y', 'Okada S', 'Suzuki T']",True
35568866,RNA adenosine modifications related to prognosis and immune infiltration in osteosarcoma.,"BACKGROUND: RNA adenosine modifications, which are primarily mediated by ""writer"" enzymes (RMWs), play a key role in epigenetic regulation in various biological processes, including tumorigenesis. However, the expression and prognostic role of these genes in osteosarcoma (OS) remain unclear. METHODS: Univariate and multivariate Cox analyses were used to construct the RMW signature for OS using Target datasets. RMW expression in OS tissue was detected by qPCR analysis. Xcell and GSVA were used to determine the relationship between RMWs and immune infiltration. The DGIdb and CMap databases were used for drug prediction. In vivo and in vitro experiments showed that strophanthidin elicited antitumor activity against OS. RESULTS: A 3-RMW (CSTF2, ADAR and WTAP) prognostic signature in OS was constructed using the Target dataset and verified using GEO datasets and 63 independent OS tissues via qPCR analysis. High-risk OS patients had poor overall survival, and the prognostic signature was an independent prognostic factor for OS. Functional studies showed that tumour-, metabolism-, cell cycle- and immune-related pathways were related to high risk. Next, we found that RMW-derived high-risk patients exhibited increased infiltration of M2 macrophages and cDCs. Furthermore, we predicted the potential drugs for OS using the DGIdb and CMap databases. In vivo and in vitro experiments showed that strophanthidin elicited antitumor activity against OS by repressing cell growth and inducing cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase.

Aberrant A-to-I editing due to dysregulation of the editing genes are involved in cancer development. However, it is still largely unclear how single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the A-to-I editing genes confer to recurrence and/or drug resistance of epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) therapy in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, we systematically evaluated and validated the role of twenty-eight potential functional genetic variants in four A-to-I editing genes (ADAR, ADARB1, ADARB2 and AIMP2) in prognosis of NSCLC patients receiving EGFR-TKIs. KEY FINDINGS: We identified the ADAR rs1127309, rs1127317, and rs2229857 SNPs markedly contributing to prognosis of patients treated with EGFR-TKIs. Interestingly, SNP rs1127317 locating in the ADAR 3'-untranslated region regulates gene expression in an allele-specific manner via modulating binding of miR-454-5p in cells. In support of this, patients with the rs1127317 C allele correlated with elevated ADAR expression in tumors showed profoundly shorten survival after EGFR-TKIs therapy compared to the A allele carriers.

However, the influence of miRNA-mediated RNA editing on tumor stem cells remains unclear. In this study, the results demonstrated that miR-17, which was downregulated in melanoma stem cells, acted as a tumor inhibitor by suppressing the stemness of melanoma stem cells and promoting cell differentiation. MiR-17 targeted ADAR2 (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 2), a gene encoding an editing enzyme required for the maintenance of melanoma stem cell stemness. In melanoma stem cells, ADAR2 was responsible for DOCK2 mRNA editing, which was able to increase the stability of DOCK2 mRNA.

35909438,Interaction With the Lipid Membrane Influences Fentanyl Pharmacology.,"Overdose deaths from fentanyl have reached epidemic proportions in the USA and are increasing worldwide. Fentanyl is a potent opioid agonist that is less well reversed by naloxone than morphine. Due to fentanyl's high lipophilicity and elongated structure we hypothesised that its unusual pharmacology may be explained by its interactions with the lipid membrane on route to binding to the μ-opioid receptor (MOPr). Through coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, electrophysiological recordings and cell signalling assays, we determined how fentanyl and morphine access the orthosteric pocket of MOPr. Morphine accesses MOPr via the aqueous pathway; first binding to an extracellular vestibule, then diffusing into the orthosteric pocket. In contrast, fentanyl may take a novel route; first partitioning into the membrane, before accessing the orthosteric site by diffusing through a ligand-induced gap between the transmembrane helices.

35133980,ADAR1-mediated RNA editing links ganglioside catabolism to glioblastoma stem cell maintenance.,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and lethal primary malignant brain tumor, containing GBM stem cells (GSCs) that contribute to therapeutic resistance and relapse. Exposing potential GSC vulnerabilities may provide therapeutic strategies against GBM. Here, we interrogated the role of adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing mediated by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) in GSCs and found that both ADAR1 and global RNA editomes were elevated in GSCs compared with normal neural stem cells. ADAR1 inactivation or blocking of the upstream JAK/STAT pathway through TYK2 inhibition impaired GSC self-renewal and stemness. Downstream of ADAR1, RNA editing of the 3'-UTR of GM2A, a key ganglioside catabolism activator, proved to be critical, as interference with ganglioside catabolism and disruption of ADAR1 showed a similar functional impact on GSCs. These findings reveal that RNA editing links ganglioside catabolism to GSC self-renewal and stemness, exposing a potential vulnerability of GBM for therapeutic intervention.",2022 Mar 15,J Clin Invest. 2022 Mar 15;132(6):e143397. doi: 10.1172/JCI143397.,"['Jiang L', 'Hao Y', 'Shao C', 'Wu Q', 'Prager BC', 'Gimple RC', 'Sulli G', 'Kim LJ', 'Zhang G', 'Qiu Z', 'Zhu Z', 'Fu XD', 'Rich JN']",True
35156720,RNA sensing via the RIG-I-like receptor LGP2 is essential for the induction of a type I IFN response in ADAR1 deficiency.,"RNA editing by the adenosine deaminase ADAR1 prevents innate immune responses to endogenous RNAs. In ADAR1-deficient cells, unedited self RNAs form base-paired structures that resemble viral RNAs and inadvertently activate the cytosolic RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) MDA5, leading to an antiviral type I interferon (IFN) response. Mutations in ADAR1 cause Aicardi-Goutières Syndrome (AGS), an autoinflammatory syndrome characterized by chronic type I IFN production. Conversely, ADAR1 loss and the consequent type I IFN production restricts tumor growth and potentiates the activity of some chemotherapeutics. Here, we show that another RIG-I-like receptor, LGP2, also has an essential role in the induction of a type I IFN response in ADAR1-deficient human cells. This requires the canonical function of LGP2 as an RNA sensor and facilitator of MDA5-dependent signaling. Furthermore, we show that the sensitivity of tumor cells to ADAR1 loss requires LGP2 expression. Finally, type I IFN induction in tumor cells depleted of ADAR1 and treated with some chemotherapeutics fully depends on LGP2 expression. These findings highlight a central role for LGP2 in self RNA sensing with important clinical implications.",2022 Mar 15,EMBO J. 2022 Mar 15;41(6):e109760. doi: 10.15252/embj.2021109760.

35328502,Mono a Mano: ZBP1's Love-Hate Relationship with the Kissing Virus.,"Z-DNA binding protein (ZBP1) very much represents the nuclear option. By initiating inflammatory cell death (ICD), ZBP1 activates host defenses to destroy infectious threats. ZBP1 is also able to induce noninflammatory regulated cell death via apoptosis (RCD). ZBP1 senses the presence of left-handed Z-DNA and Z-RNA (ZNA), including that formed by expression of endogenous retroelements. Viruses such as the Epstein-Barr ""kissing virus"" inhibit ICD, RCD and other cell death signaling pathways to produce persistent infection. EBV undergoes lytic replication in plasma cells, which maintain detectable levels of basal ZBP1 expression, leading us to suggest a new role for ZBP1 in maintaining EBV latency, one of benefit for both host and virus. We provide an overview of the pathways that are involved in establishing latent infection, including those regulated by MYC and NF-κB. We describe and provide a synthesis of the evidence supporting a role for ZNA in these pathways, highlighting the positive and negative selection of ZNA forming sequences in the EBV genome that underscores the coadaptation of host and virus. Instead of a fight to the death, a state of détente now exists where persistent infection by the virus is tolerated by the host, while disease outcomes such as death, autoimmunity and cancer are minimized. Based on these new insights, we propose actionable therapeutic approaches to unhost EBV.",2022 Mar 12,Int J Mol Sci. 2022 Mar 12;23(6):3079. doi: 10.3390/ijms23063079.,"['Herbert A', 'Fedorov A', 'Poptsova M']",True
34921950,Pterostilbene ameliorates the disrupted Adars expression and improves liver fibrosis in DEN-induced liver injury in Wistar rats: A novel potential effect.,"The knowledge of RNA editing modifications and its subsequent proteomic diversity in is still limited and represents only the tip of the iceberg. Adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing is the most prevalent in RNA editome with a rising role for ADARgene family as a major regulator of the dynamic landscape of RNA editing. This study aimed at evaluating the potential chemopreventive effects of the epigenetic regulator ""pterostilbene"" in diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-exposedrat model. Consequently, the hepatic Adars expression was investigated as a possible mechanism for mediation of the putative pterostilbene-induced chemopreventive effect. The effects of administration of pterostilbene were investigated on the structural changes, immunohistochemical staining, liver function test, serum alpha feto-protein (AFP), IL-6, and hepatic Adar1 and Adar2 relative gene expression at the beginning and at the 6th week of the study. Pterostilbene attenuated DEN-induced liver injury, improves hepatocyte parrafin-1 (Hep Par-1), decreases heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), improved AFP, serum albumin, transaminases, IL-6 with alleviation of disturbed hepatic Adar1 and Adar2 expression. This study spotlights the role of pterostilbene in attenuation of DEN-induced liver injury which could be mediated, at least partially, through the alleviation of the aberrant expression of Adar enzymes. Yet, more in-depth studies are needed to further elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of pterostilbene on RNA editing enzymes.",2022 Mar 1,Gene. 2022 Mar 1;813:146124. doi: 10.1016/j.gene.2021.146124.

This cellular process is highly dependent on the expression and sequential activation of a diverse group of transcription factors. Here, we report that ADAR1 (also known as ADAR) could inhibit adipogenesis through binding with Dicer (also known as DICER1), resulting in enhanced production of miR-155-5p, which downregulates the adipogenic early transcription factor C/EBPβ. Consequently, the expression levels of late-stage adipogenic transcription factors (C/EBPα and PPARγ) are reduced and adipogenesis is inhibited. More importantly, in vivo studies reveal that overexpression of ADAR1 suppresses white adipose tissue expansion in high fat diet-induced obese mice, leading to improved metabolic phenotypes, such as insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance.",2022 Mar 1,J Cell Sci. 2022 Mar 1;135(5):jcs259333. doi: 10.1242/jcs.259333.

However, its role in non-infected cells is yet to be thoroughly characterized. Here, we demonstrated that the RNA sensing signaling pathway also reacts to the endogenous cellular RNAs in endothelial cells (ECs), and this reaction is regulated by the RNA-editing enzyme ADAR1. Cellular RNA sequencing analysis showed that EC RNAs endure extensive RNA editing, especially in the RNA transcripts of short interspersed nuclear elements. The EC-specific deletion of ADAR1 dramatically reduced the editing level on short interspersed nuclear element RNAs, resulting in newborn death in mice with damage evident in multiple organs. Genome-wide gene expression analysis revealed a prominent innate immune activation with a dramatically elevated expression of interferon-stimulated genes. However, blocking the RNA sensing signaling pathway by deletion of the cellular RNA receptor MDA-5 prevented interferon-stimulated gene expression and rescued the newborn mice from death. This evidence demonstrated that the RNA-editing/RNA-sensing signaling pathway dramatically modulates EC function, representing a novel molecular mechanism for the regulation of EC functions.",2022 Mar,Life Sci Alliance. 2021 Dec 30;5(3):e202101191. doi: 10.26508/lsa.202101191.

It remains unclear whether and to what extent the virus in human host cells undergoes RNA editing, a major RNA modification mechanism. Here we perform a robust bioinformatic analysis of metatranscriptomic data from multiple bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples of COVID-19 patients, revealing an appreciable number of A-to-I RNA editing candidate sites in SARS-CoV-2. We confirm the enrichment of A-to-I RNA editing signals at these candidate sites through evaluating four characteristics specific to RNA editing: the inferred RNA editing sites exhibit (i) stronger ADAR1 binding affinity predicted by a deep-learning model built from ADAR1 CLIP-seq data, (ii) decreased editing levels in ADAR1-inhibited human lung cells, (iii) local clustering patterns, and (iv) higher RNA secondary structure propensity.

METHODS: A total of 48 SLE patients (24 with disease onset ≤10 years of age and 24 with disease onset >10 years of age) were included. Patients with late-onset disease have been used as patient controls. Sequencing was carried out using 400 bp kit on the Ion S5 system. RESULTS: Among the 48 patients, three had one pathogenic variant and 45 patients had at least one rare variant classified as benign, likely benign or variant of unknown significance (VUS). In all three patients with a pathogenic variant, the onset of disease was before 10 years of age. Two patients (they were siblings) carried C1QA homozygote pathogenic allele (p.Gln208Ter, rs121909581), and one patient carried PEPD heterozygote pathogenic allele (p.Arg184Gln, rs121917722). CONCLUSION: We demonstrated a pathogenic variant in our target gene panel with a frequency of 9.52% in patients with a disease onset ≤10 years of age. All patients with early-onset SLE phenotype, irrespective of a positive family history for SLE or parental consanguinity, should be scanned for a single-gene defect by a targeted gene panel sequencing.

35124003,ADAR1- and ADAR2-mediated regulation of maturation and targeting of miR-376b to modulate GABA neurotransmitter catabolism.,"miRNAs are short noncoding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression by inhibiting translation or inducing degradation of target mRNAs. miRNAs are often expressed as polycistronic transcripts, so-called miRNA clusters, containing several miRNA precursors. The largest mammalian miRNA cluster, the miR-379-410 cluster, is expressed primarily during embryonic development and in the adult brain; however, downstream regulation of this cluster is not well understood. Here, we investigated adenosine deamination to inosine (RNA editing) in the miR-379-410 cluster by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) enzymes as a possible mechanism modulating the expression and activity of these miRNAs in a brain-specific manner. We show that the levels of editing in the majority of mature miRNAs are lower than the editing levels of the corresponding site in primary miRNA precursors. However, for one miRNA, miR-376b-3p, editing was significantly higher in the mature form than in the primary precursor. We found miR-376b-3p maturation is negatively regulated by ADAR2 in an editing activity-independent manner, whereas ADAR1-mediated and ADAR2-mediated editing were observed to be competitive. In addition, the edited miR-376b-3p targets a different set of mRNAs than unedited miR-376b-3p, including 4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase, encoding the enzyme responsible for the catabolism of the neurotransmitter gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA). Expression of edited miR-376b-3p led to increased intracellular GABA levels as well as increased cell surface presentation of GABA type A receptors. Our results indicate that both editing and editing-independent effects modulate the expression of miR-376b-3p, with the potential to regulate GABAergic signaling in the brain.",2022 Mar,J Biol Chem. 2022 Mar;298(3):101682. doi: 10.1016/j.jbc.2022.101682.

35247916,Transcriptome Profiling of ADAR1 Targets in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cells Reveals Mechanisms for Regulating Growth and Invasion.,"ADARs catalyze adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing of double-stranded RNA and regulate global gene expression output through interactions with RNA and other proteins. ADARs play important roles in development and disease, and previous work has shown that ADAR1 is oncogenic in a growing list of cancer types. Here we show that ADAR1 is a critical gene for triple-negative breast cancer cells, as ADAR1 loss results in reduced growth (viability and cell cycle progression), invasion, and mammosphere formation. Whole transcriptome sequencing analyses demonstrate that ADAR1 regulates both coding and noncoding targets by altering gene expression level, A-to-I editing, and splicing. We determine that a recoding edit in filamin B (FLNB chr3:58156064) reduces the tumor suppressive activities of the protein to promote growth and invasion. We also show that several tumor suppressor miRNAs are upregulated upon ADAR1 loss and suppress cell-cycle progression and invasion. This work describes several novel mechanisms of ADAR1-mediated oncogenesis in triple-negative breast cancer, providing support to strategies targeting ADAR1 in this aggressive cancer type that has few treatment options. IMPLICATIONS: Targeting ADAR1 and thus downstream FLNB editing and miRNA regulation represents a possible novel therapeutic strategy in triple-negative breast cancer.",2022 Jun 3,Mol Cancer Res. 2022 Jun 3;20(6):960-971. doi: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-21-0604.,"['Baker AR', 'Miliotis C', 'Ramírez-Moya J', 'Marc T', 'Vlachos IS', 'Santisteban P', 'Slack FJ']",False
35737129,Reduction of A-to-I RNA editing in the failing human heart regulates formation of circular RNAs.,"Alterations of RNA editing that affect the secondary structure of RNAs can cause human diseases. We therefore studied RNA editing in failing human hearts. Transcriptome sequencing showed that adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing was responsible for 80% of the editing events in the myocardium. Failing human hearts were characterized by reduced RNA editing. This was primarily attributable to Alu elements in introns of protein-coding genes. In the failing left ventricle, 166 circRNAs were upregulated and 7 circRNAs were downregulated compared to non-failing controls. Most of the upregulated circRNAs were associated with reduced RNA editing in the host gene. ADAR2, which binds to RNA regions that are edited from A-to-I, was decreased in failing human hearts. In vitro, reduction of ADAR2 increased circRNA levels suggesting a causal effect of reduced ADAR2 levels on increased circRNAs in the failing human heart. To gain mechanistic insight, one of the identified upregulated circRNAs with a high reduction of editing in heart failure, AKAP13, was further characterized. ADAR2 reduced the formation of double-stranded structures in AKAP13 pre-mRNA, thereby reducing the stability of Alu elements and the circularization of the resulting circRNA. Overexpression of circAKAP13 impaired the sarcomere regularity of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes. These data show that ADAR2 mediates A-to-I RNA editing in the human heart. A-to-I RNA editing represses the formation of dsRNA structures of Alu elements favoring canonical linear mRNA splicing and inhibiting the formation of circRNAs. The findings are relevant to diseases with reduced RNA editing and increased circRNA levels and provide insights into the human-specific regulation of circRNA formation.",2022 Jun 23,Basic Res Cardiol. 2022 Jun 23;117(1):32. doi: 10.1007/s00395-022-00940-9.,"['Kokot KE', 'Kneuer JM', 'John D', 'Rebs S', 'Möbius-Winkler MN', 'Erbe S', 'Müller M', 'Andritschke M', 'Gaul S', 'Sheikh BN', 'Haas J', 'Thiele H', 'Müller OJ', 'Hille S', 'Leuschner F', 'Dimmeler S', 'Streckfuss-Bömeke K', 'Meder B', 'Laufs U', 'Boeckel JN']",False

Here, we used TRIBE (target of RNA-binding proteins identified by editing) to profile stress granule RNAs. We used an RNA-binding protein (FMR1) fused to the catalytic domain of an RNA-editing enzyme (ADAR), which coalesces into stress granules upon oxidative stress. RNAs colocalized with this fusion are edited, producing mutations that are detectable by VASA sequencing. Using single-molecule FISH, we validated that this purification-free method can reliably identify stress granule RNAs in bulk and single S2 cells and in Drosophila neurons.

The alterations of the epitranscriptome, including more than 170 distinct posttranscriptional RNA modifications or editing events, justified their investigation as an important modulator of fibrosis. Recent development of high-throughput methods allows the identification of RNA modification sites and their mechanistic aspect in the fibrosis development. The most common RNA modification is methylation of N(6)-adenosine deposited by the m(6)A methyltransferase complex (METTL3/14/16, WTAP, KIAA1429, and RBM15/15B), erased by demethylases (FTO and ALKBH5), and recognized by binding proteins (e.g., YTHDF1/2/3, YTHDC1/2, IGF2BP1/2/3, etc.).

35477155,Breakage of cytoplasmic chromosomes by pathological DNA base excision repair.,"Chromothripsis is a catastrophic mutational process that promotes tumorigenesis and causes congenital disease(1-4). Chromothripsis originates from aberrations of nuclei called micronuclei or chromosome bridges(5-8). These structures are associated with fragile nuclear envelopes that spontaneously rupture(9,10), leading to DNA damage when chromatin is exposed to the interphase cytoplasm. Here we identify a mechanism explaining a major fraction of this DNA damage. Micronuclei accumulate large amounts of RNA-DNA hybrids, which are edited by adenine deaminases acting on RNA (ADAR enzymes) to generate deoxyinosine. Deoxyinosine is then converted into abasic sites by a DNA base excision repair (BER) glycosylase, N-methyl-purine DNA glycosylase(11,12) (MPG). These abasic sites are cleaved by the BER endonuclease, apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease(12) (APE1), creating single-stranded DNA nicks that can be converted to DNA double strand breaks by DNA replication or when closely spaced nicks occur on opposite strands(13,14). This model predicts that MPG should be able to remove the deoxyinosine base from the DNA strand of RNA-DNA hybrids, which we demonstrate using purified proteins and oligonucleotide substrates. These findings identify a mechanism for fragmentation of micronuclear chromosomes, an important step in generating chromothripsis. Rather than breaking any normal chromosome, we propose that the eukaryotic cytoplasm only damages chromosomes with pre-existing defects such as the DNA base abnormality described here.",2022 Jun,Nature. 2022 Jun;606(7916):930-936. doi: 10.1038/s41586-022-04767-1.

35614224,ADAR1 masks the cancer immunotherapeutic promise of ZBP1-driven necroptosis.,"Only a small proportion of patients with cancer show lasting responses to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB)-based monotherapies. The RNA-editing enzyme ADAR1 is an emerging determinant of resistance to ICB therapy and prevents ICB responsiveness by repressing immunogenic double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs), such as those arising from the dysregulated expression of endogenous retroviral elements (EREs)(1-4). These dsRNAs trigger an interferon-dependent antitumour response by activating A-form dsRNA (A-RNA)-sensing proteins such as MDA-5 and PKR(5). Here we show that ADAR1 also prevents the accrual of endogenous Z-form dsRNA elements (Z-RNAs), which were enriched in the 3' untranslated regions of interferon-stimulated mRNAs. Depletion or mutation of ADAR1 resulted in Z-RNA accumulation and activation of the Z-RNA sensor ZBP1, which culminated in RIPK3-mediated necroptosis. As no clinically viable ADAR1 inhibitors currently exist, we searched for a compound that can override the requirement for ADAR1 inhibition and directly activate ZBP1. We identified a small molecule, the curaxin CBL0137, which potently activates ZBP1 by triggering Z-DNA formation in cells. CBL0137 induced ZBP1-dependent necroptosis in cancer-associated fibroblasts and reversed ICB unresponsiveness in mouse models of melanoma. Collectively, these results demonstrate that ADAR1 represses endogenous Z-RNAs and identifies ZBP1-mediated necroptosis as a new determinant of tumour immunogenicity masked by ADAR1. Therapeutic activation of ZBP1-induced necroptosis provides a readily translatable avenue for rekindling the immune responsiveness of ICB-resistant human cancers.",2022 Jun,Nature. 2022 Jun;606(7914):594-602. doi: 10.1038/s41586-022-04753-7.

35906682,Proteotranscriptomics of ocular adnexal B-cell lymphoma reveals an oncogenic role of alternative splicing and identifies a diagnostic marker.,"BACKGROUND: Ocular adnexal B-cell lymphoma (OABL) is a rare subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The molecular characteristics of OABL remain poorly understood. We performed an integrated study to investigate the proteotranscriptome landscape and identify novel molecular characteristics and biomarkers of OABL. METHODS: Integrated quantitative proteome and transcriptome were performed on 40 OABL 12 idiopathic orbital inflammation, 6 reactive lymphoid hyperplasia, and 13 aesthetic orbital plastic surgery specimens. Complete clinicopathologic and prognostic data of the patients were recorded. RESULTS: We identified high global protein-mRNA concordance as a novel characteristic of OABL. High concordance was related to OABL recurrence. By integrated expression profile, motif enrichment and trend analysis, we found that alternative splicing is inflammation-independently dysregulated in OABL. After portraying the aberrant alternative splicing event landscape, we demonstrated the oncogenic role of ADAR, a core splicing regulator that regulates the splicing of Rho GTPase and cell cycle members. We found that ADAR regulates cell proliferation and Rho GTPase inhibitor sensitivity of lymphoma. We identified DNAJC9 as a potential biomarker for OABL in proteomic analyses. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescent staining showed the nuclear staining of DNAJC9 was significantly higher in extranodal marginal zone lymphomas compared with inflammation specimens. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide an integrated gene expression profiling and demonstrate that high global protein-mRNA concordance is a prognosis-related molecular characteristic of OABL. We portray the alternative splicing events landscape of OABL, and reveal the oncogenic role of ADAR. We identified strong nuclear staining of DNAJC9 as a promising pathology diagnostic biomarker for extranodal marginal zone lymphomas.",2022 Jul 30,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2022 Jul 30;41(1):234. doi: 10.1186/s13046-022-02445-8.,"['Shi J', 'Zhu T', 'Lin H', 'Liu Z', 'Zhou M', 'Yu Z', 'Zhou X', 'Song X', 'Wang Y', 'Jia R', 'Fan X', 'Zhou Y']",True
35796272,Prolyl Isomerase Pin1 Expression in the Spinal Motor Neurons of Patients With Sporadic Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal motor neuron disease. Selective deficiency of edited adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 2 (ADAR2), a key molecule in the acquisition of Ca(2+) resistance in motor neurons, has been reported in sporadic ALS (sALS) spinal motor neurons. Since ADAR2 activity is positively regulated by prolyl isomerase Protein never in mitosis gene A interacting-1 (Pin1), a known phosphorylation-dependent peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase, we investigated Pin1 expression in spinal motor neurons in sALS. METHODS: Specimens of the spinal cord were obtained from the lumbar region in eight sALS patients and age-matched five controls after postmortem examinations. The specimens were double stained with anti-Pin1 and anti-TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) antibodies, and examined under a fluorescence microscope. RESULTS: This study analyzed 254 and 422 spinal motor neurons from 8 sALS patients and 5 control subjects, respectively. The frequency of motor neurons with high cytoplasmic Pin1 expression from the spinal cord did not differ significantly between sALS specimens without cytoplasmic TDP-43 inclusions and control specimens. However, in sALS specimens, neurons for which the Pin1 immunoluminescence intensity in the cytoplasm was at least twice that in the background were more common in specimens with cytoplasmic TDP-43 inclusions (p<0.05 in χ² test). CONCLUSIONS: In sALS, neurons with higher expression levels of Pin1 levels had more TDP-43 inclusions. Despite the feedback mechanism between Pin1 and ADAR2 being unclear, since Pin1 positively regulates ADAR2, our results suggest that higher Pin1 expression levels in motor neurons with TDP-43 pathology from sALS patients represent a compensatory mechanism.",2022 Jul,J Clin Neurol. 2022 Jul;18(4):463-469. doi: 10.3988/jcn.2022.18.4.463.,"['Kato H', 'Naito M', 'Saito T', 'Hideyama T', 'Suzuki Y', 'Kimura T', 'Kwak S', 'Aizawa H']",True
35859176,ADAR1 averts fatal type I interferon induction by ZBP1.,"Mutations of the ADAR1 gene encoding an RNA deaminase cause severe diseases associated with chronic activation of type I interferon (IFN) responses, including Aicardi-Goutières syndrome and bilateral striatal necrosis(1-3). The IFN-inducible p150 isoform of ADAR1 contains a Zα domain that recognizes RNA with an alternative left-handed double-helix structure, termed Z-RNA(4,5). Hemizygous ADAR1 mutations in the Zα domain cause type I IFN-mediated pathologies in humans(2,3) and mice(6-8); however, it remains unclear how the interaction of ADAR1 with Z-RNA prevents IFN activation. Here we show that Z-DNA-binding protein 1 (ZBP1), the only other protein in mammals known to harbour Zα domains(9), promotes type I IFN activation and fatal pathology in mice with impaired ADAR1 function. ZBP1 deficiency or mutation of its Zα domains reduced the expression of IFN-stimulated genes and largely prevented early postnatal lethality in mice with hemizygous expression of ADAR1 with mutated Zα domain (Adar1(mZα/-) mice). Adar1(mZα/-) mice showed upregulation and impaired editing of endogenous retroelement-derived complementary RNA reads, which represent a likely source of Z-RNAs activating ZBP1. Notably, ZBP1 promoted IFN activation and severe pathology in Adar1(mZα/-) mice in a manner independent of RIPK1, RIPK3, MLKL-mediated necroptosis and caspase-8-dependent apoptosis, suggesting a novel mechanism of action. Thus, ADAR1 prevents endogenous Z-RNA-dependent activation of pathogenic type I IFN responses by ZBP1, suggesting that ZBP1 could contribute to type I interferonopathies caused by ADAR1 mutations.",2022 Jul,Nature. 2022 Jul;607(7920):776-783. doi: 10.1038/s41586-022-04878-9.

35859177,ADAR1 mutation causes ZBP1-dependent immunopathology.,"The RNA-editing enzyme ADAR1 is essential for the suppression of innate immune activation and pathology caused by aberrant recognition of self-RNA, a role it carries out by disrupting the duplex structure of endogenous double-stranded RNA species(1,2). A point mutation in the sequence encoding the Z-DNA-binding domain (ZBD) of ADAR1 is associated with severe autoinflammatory disease(3-5). ZBP1 is the only other ZBD-containing mammalian protein(6), and its activation can trigger both cell death and transcriptional responses through the kinases RIPK1 and RIPK3, and the protease caspase 8 (refs. (7-9)). Here we show that the pathology caused by alteration of the ZBD of ADAR1 is driven by activation of ZBP1. We found that ablation of ZBP1 fully rescued the overt pathology caused by ADAR1 alteration, without fully reversing the underlying inflammatory program caused by this alteration. Whereas loss of RIPK3 partially phenocopied the protective effects of ZBP1 ablation, combined deletion of caspase 8 and RIPK3, or of caspase 8 and MLKL, unexpectedly exacerbated the pathogenic effects of ADAR1 alteration. These findings indicate that ADAR1 is a negative regulator of sterile ZBP1 activation, and that ZBP1-dependent signalling underlies the autoinflammatory pathology caused by alteration of ADAR1.",2022 Jul,Nature. 2022 Jul;607(7920):769-775. doi: 10.1038/s41586-022-04896-7.

Here we describe short, chemically modified oligonucleotides called AIMers that direct efficient and specific A-to-I editing of endogenous transcripts by endogenous adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADAR) enzymes, including the ubiquitously and constitutively expressed ADAR1 p110 isoform. We show that fully chemically modified AIMers with chimeric backbones containing stereopure phosphorothioate and nitrogen-containing linkages based on phosphoryl guanidine enhanced potency and editing efficiency 100-fold compared with those with uniformly phosphorothioate-modified backbones in vitro. In vivo, AIMers targeted to hepatocytes with N-acetylgalactosamine achieve up to 50% editing with no bystander editing of the endogenous ACTB transcript in non-human primate liver, with editing persisting for at least one month.

35508354,Rampant C-to-U deamination accounts for the intrinsically high mutation rate in SARS-CoV-2 spike gene.,"The high mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 largely complicates our control of the pandemic. In particular, it is currently unclear why the spike (S) gene has an extraordinarily high mutation rate among all SARS-CoV-2 genes. By analyzing the occurrence of fixed synonymous mutations between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13, and profiling the DAF (derived allele frequency) of polymorphic synonymous sites among millions of worldwide SARS-CoV-2 strains, we found that both fixed and polymorphic mutations show higher mutation rates in the S gene than other genes. The majority of mutations are C-to-T, representing the APOBEC-mediated C-to-U deamination instead of the previously proposed A-to-I deamination. Both in silico and in vivo evidence indicated that the S gene is more likely to be single-stranded compared to other SARS-CoV-2 genes, agreeing with the APOBEC preference of ssRNA. We conclude that the single-stranded property of the S gene makes it a favorable target for C-to-U deamination, leading to its excessively high mutation rate compared to other non-S genes. In conclusion, APOBEC, rather than ADAR, is the ""editor-in-chief"" of SARS-CoV-2 RNAs.

Traditionally, inosines are identified indirectly as variants from Illumina RNA-sequencing data because they are interpreted as guanosines by cellular machineries. However, this indirect method performs poorly in protein-coding regions where exons are typically short, in non-model organisms with sparsely annotated single-nucleotide polymorphisms, or in disease contexts where unknown DNA mutations are pervasive. Here, we show that Oxford Nanopore direct RNA sequencing can be used to identify inosine-containing sites in native transcriptomes with high accuracy. We trained convolutional neural network models to distinguish inosine from adenosine and guanosine, and to estimate the modification rate at each editing site. Furthermore, we demonstrated their utility on the transcriptomes of human, mouse and Xenopus.

35859175,ADAR1 prevents autoinflammation by suppressing spontaneous ZBP1 activation.,"The RNA-editing enzyme adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) limits the accumulation of endogenous immunostimulatory double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)(1). In humans, reduced ADAR1 activity causes the severe inflammatory disease Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS)(2). In mice, complete loss of ADAR1 activity is embryonically lethal(3-6), and mutations similar to those found in patients with AGS cause autoinflammation(7-12). Mechanistically, adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) base modification of endogenous dsRNA by ADAR1 prevents chronic overactivation of the dsRNA sensors MDA5 and PKR(3,7-10,13,14). Here we show that ADAR1 also inhibits the spontaneous activation of the left-handed Z-nucleic acid sensor ZBP1. Activation of ZBP1 elicits caspase-8-dependent apoptosis and MLKL-mediated necroptosis of ADAR1-deficient cells. ZBP1 contributes to the embryonic lethality of Adar-knockout mice, and it drives early mortality and intestinal cell death in mice deficient in the expression of both ADAR and MAVS. The Z-nucleic-acid-binding Zα domain of ADAR1 is necessary to prevent ZBP1-mediated intestinal cell death and skin inflammation. The Zα domain of ADAR1 promotes A-to-I editing of endogenous Alu elements to prevent dsRNA formation through the pairing of inverted Alu repeats, which can otherwise induce ZBP1 activation. This shows that recognition of Alu duplex RNA by ZBP1 may contribute to the pathological features of AGS that result from the loss of ADAR1 function.",2022 Jul,Nature. 2022 Jul;607(7920):784-789. doi: 10.1038/s41586-022-04974-w.

34274534,ADAR2 increases in exercised heart and protects against myocardial infarction and doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity.,"Exercise training benefits the heart. The knowledge of post-transcription regulation, especially RNA editing, in hearts remain rare. ADAR2 is an enzyme that edits adenosine to inosine nucleotides in double-stranded RNA, and RNA editing is associated with many human diseases. We found that ADAR2 was upregulated in hearts during exercise training. AAV9-mediated cardiac-specific ADAR2 overexpression attenuated acute myocardial infarction (AMI), MI remodeling, and doxorubicin (DOX)-induced cardiotoxicity. In vitro, overexpression of ADAR2 inhibited DOX-induced cardiomyocyte (CM) apoptosis. but it could also induce neonatal rat CM proliferation. Mechanistically, ADAR2 could regulate the abundance of mature miR-34a in CMs. Regulations of miR-34a or its target genes (Sirt1, Cyclin D1, and Bcl2) could affect the pro-proliferation and anti-apoptosis effects of ADAR2 on CMs. These data demonstrated that exercise-induced ADAR2 protects the heart from MI and DOX-induced cardiotoxicity.

35909497,Role of Acetaldehyde in Ethanol Reversal of Tolerance to Morphine-Induced Respiratory Depression in Mice.,"BACKGROUND: Opioid users regularly consume other drugs such as alcohol (ethanol). Acute administration of ethanol rapidly reverses tolerance to morphine-induced respiratory depression. However, recent research has suggested that the primary metabolite of ethanol, acetaldehyde, may play a key role in mediating the CNS effects seen after ethanol consumption. This research investigated the role of acetaldehyde in ethanol reversal of tolerance to morphine-induced respiratory depression. METHODS: Tolerance was induced in mice by 6-days implantation of a 75 mg morphine pellet with control mice implanted with a placebo pellet. Tolerance was assessed by acute morphine administration on day 6 and respiration measured by plethysmography. Levels of acetaldehyde were inhibited or enhanced by pre-treatments with the acetaldehyde chelator D-penicillamine and the inhibitor of acetaldehyde dehydrogenase disulfiram respectively. RESULTS: Morphine pellet implanted mice displayed tolerance to an acute dose of morphine compared to placebo pellet implanted controls. Acute acetaldehyde administration dose-dependently reversed tolerance to morphine respiratory depression. As previously demonstrated, ethanol reversed morphine tolerance, and this was inhibited by D-penicillamine pre-treatment. An acute, low dose of ethanol that did not significantly reverse morphine tolerance was able to do so following disulfiram pre-treatment. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that acetaldehyde, the primary metabolite of ethanol, is responsible for the reversal of morphine tolerance observed following ethanol administration.",2022 Jan 31,Adv Drug Alcohol Res. 2022 Jan 31;1:adar.2021.10143. doi: 10.3389/adar.2021.10143.,"['Hill R', 'Conibear A', 'Dewey W', 'Kelly E', 'Henderson G']",False
34978432,RNA Editing with Viral RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase.,"RNA editing is currently attracting attention as a method for editing genetic information without injury to the genome. The most common approach to edit RNA sequences involves the induction of an A-to-I change by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR). However, this method only allows point editing. Here, we report a highly flexible RNA editing method called ""RNA overwriting"" that employs the influenza A virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) comprising PA, PB1, and PB2 subunits. RdRp binds to the 5'-cap structure of the host mRNA and cleaves at the AG site, followed by transcription of the viral RNA; this process is called cap-snatching. We engineered a targeting snatch system wherein the target RNA is cleaved and extended at any site addressed by guide RNA (gRNA). We constructed five recombinant RdRps containing a PB2 mutant and demonstrated the editing capability of RdRp mutants by using short RNAs in vitro. PB2-480-containing RdRp exhibited good performance in both cleavage and extension assays; we succeeded in RNA overwriting using PB2-480-containing RdRp. In principle, this method allows RNA editing of any type including mutation, addition, and deletion, by changing the sequence of the template RNA to the sequence of interest; hence, the use of viral RdRp could open new avenues in RNA editing and be a powerful tool in life science.",2022 Jan 21,ACS Synth Biol. 2022 Jan 21;11(1):46-52. doi: 10.1021/acssynbio.1c00332.

Towards addressing these issues, we first performed a novel deep mutational scan of the ADAR2 deaminase domain, directly measuring the impact of every amino acid substitution across 261 residues, on RNA editing. This enabled us to create a domain-wide mutagenesis map while also revealing a novel hyperactive variant with improved enzymatic activity at 5'-GAN-3' motifs. As overexpression of ADAR enzymes, especially hyperactive variants, can lead to significant transcriptome-wide off-targeting, we next engineered a split-ADAR2 deaminase which resulted in >100-fold more specific RNA editing as compared to full-length deaminase overexpression. Taken together, we anticipate this systematic engineering of the ADAR2 deaminase domain will enable broader utility of the ADAR toolset for RNA biotechnology applications.",2022 Jan 19,Elife. 2022 Jan 19;11:e75555. doi: 10.7554/eLife.75555.,"['Katrekar D', 'Xiang Y', 'Palmer N', 'Saha A', 'Meluzzi D', 'Mali P']",False

METHODS: BABL/C mice, primary neonatal rat cardiomyocytes and H9c2 cells were infected with Coxsackie virus B3 (CVB3) to establish animal and cellular models of VMC. H&E staining revealed the pathologic condition of myocardium. ELISA measured the serum levels of creatine kinase, creatine kinase isoenzyme and cardiac troponin I. The effects of A20, miR-1a-3p and ADAR1 were investigated using gain and loss of function approaches. ELISA measured the levels of IL-6, IL-18 and TNF-α in serum or cell culture supernatant. TUNEL staining and flow cytometry assessed the apoptosis of myocardium and cardiomyocytes, respectively. RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation and dual-luciferase reporter assays verified the binding between A20 and miR-1a-3p. Co-immunoprecipitation assay verified the binding between ADAR1 and Dicer. RESULTS: A20 was underexpressed and miR-1a-3p was overexpressed in the myocardium of VMC mice as well as in CVB3-infected cardiomyocytes. Overexpression of A20 suppressed cardiomyocyte inflammation and apoptosis in vivo and in vitro. miR-1a-3p promoted CVB3-induced inflammation and apoptosis in cardiomyocytes by binding to A20. The expression of miR-1a-3p was regulated by ADAR1. ADAR1 promoted the slicing of miR-1a-3p precursor by binding to Dicer.

35041722,Functional analysis of ADARs in planarians supports a bilaterian ancestral role in suppressing double-stranded RNA-response.,"ADARs (adenosine deaminases acting on RNA) are known for their adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing activity, and most recently, for their role in preventing aberrant dsRNA-response by activation of dsRNA sensors (i.e., RIG-I-like receptor homologs). However, it is still unclear whether suppressing spurious dsRNA-response represents the ancestral role of ADARs in bilaterians. As a first step to address this question, we identified ADAR1 and ADAR2 homologs in the planarian Schmidtea mediterranea, which is evolutionarily distant from canonical lab models (e.g., flies and nematodes). Our results indicate that knockdown of either planarian adar1 or adar2 by RNA interference (RNAi) resulted in upregulation of dsRNA-response genes, including three planarian rig-I-like receptor (prlr) homologs. Furthermore, independent knockdown of adar1 and adar2 reduced the number of infected cells with a dsRNA virus, suggesting they suppress a bona fide anti-viral dsRNA-response activity. Knockdown of adar1 also resulted in lesion formation and animal lethality, thus attesting to its essentiality. Simultaneous knockdown of adar1 and prlr1 rescued adar1(RNAi)-dependent animal lethality and rescued the dsRNA-response, suggesting that it contributes to the deleterious effect of adar1 knockdown. Finally, we found that ADAR2, but not ADAR1, mediates mRNA editing in planarians, suggesting at least in part non-redundant activities for planarians ADARs. Our results underline the essential role of ADARs in suppressing activation of harmful dsRNA-response in planarians, thus supporting it as their ancestral role in bilaterians. Our work also set the stage to study further and better understand the regulatory mechanisms governing anti-viral dsRNA-responses from an evolutionary standpoint using planarians as a model.",2022 Jan,PLoS Pathog. 2022 Jan 18;18(1):e1010250. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1010250. eCollection 2022 Jan.,['Bar Yaacov D'],False

Here, we evaluated a total of 19,316 RNA editing sites in the tissues of 80 lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients from our Nanjing Lung Cancer Cohort (NJLCC) and 486 LUAD patients from the TCGA database. The global RNA editing level was significantly increased in tumor tissues and was highly heterogeneous across patients. The high RNA editing level in tumors was attributed to both RNA (ADAR1 expression) and DNA alterations (mutation load). Consensus clustering on RNA editing sites revealed a new molecular subtype (EC3) that was associated with the poorest prognosis of LUAD patients. Importantly, the new classification was independent of classic molecular subtypes based on gene expression or DNA methylation.

The model was further validated in the TCGA dataset and had an area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.93 (95%CI: 0.91-0.95).

34105255,The role of RNA editing enzyme ADAR1 in human disease.,"Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) catalyzes the posttranscriptional conversion of adenosine to inosine in double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), which can lead to the creation of missense mutations in coding sequences. Recent studies show that editing-dependent functions of ADAR1 protect dsRNA from dsRNA-sensing molecules and inhibit innate immunity and the interferon-mediated response. Deficiency in these ADAR1 functions underlie the pathogenesis of autoinflammatory diseases such as the type I interferonopathies Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome and dyschromatosis symmetrica hereditaria. ADAR1-mediated editing of endogenous coding and noncoding RNA as well as ADAR1 editing-independent interactions with DICER can also have oncogenic or tumor suppressive effects that affect tumor proliferation, invasion, and response to immunotherapy. The combination of proviral and antiviral roles played by ADAR1 in repressing the interferon response and editing viral RNAs alters viral morphogenesis and cell susceptibility to infection. This review analyzes the structure and function of ADAR1 with a focus on its position in human disease pathways and the mechanisms of its disease-associated effects.

34727289,Investigation of SRP9 protein expression in breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Signal recognition particle (SRP) promotes co-translational translocation of the proteins through or into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and it also has elongation arrest function. SRP9 is one of the six protein subunits of SRP and functions in elongation arrest activity by forming a heterodimeric structure with SRP14. It is one of the substrates of ADAR, which has been found to have a role in breast cancer. This study was conducted to investigate the SRP9 protein expression in normal and tumor tissues of patients with breast cancer and determine its prognostic significance. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 32 female patients who were diagnosed as having primary breast cancer and underwent surgery were included in the study. Western Blotting was performed to detect SRP9 protein expression levels in normal and tumor tissue samples. Clinical and pathologic characteristics were analyzed to assess the prognostic significance. SRP9 protein expression was statistically higher in the breast cancer tissue samples compared to normal matched tissue, and the mean SRP9 protein expression levels of breast cancer tissue normal tissue samples were 1.019 ± 1.011 and 0.551 ± 0.456, respectively (p = 0.001). SRP9 protein expression levels in tumor tissue of patients with lymph node metastasis, tumor size > 2 cm, estrogen receptor-positive, progesterone receptor-positive, and HER-2 negative were statistically higher than in normal tissue (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: It is vital to clarify the roles of molecules such as SRP9 in understanding the pathogenesis of breast cancer.

35993275,The A to I editing landscape in melanoma and its relation to clinical outcome.,"RNA editing refers to non-transient RNA modifications that occur after transcription and prior to translation by the ribosomes. RNA editing is more widespread in cancer cells than in non-transformed cells and is associated with tumorigenesis of various cancer tissues. However, RNA editing can also generate neo-antigens that expose tumour cells to host immunosurveillance. Global RNA editing in melanoma and its relevance to clinical outcome currently remain poorly characterized. The present study compared RNA editing as well as gene expression in tumour cell lines from melanoma patients of short or long metastasis-free survival, patients relapsing or not after immuno- and targeted therapy and tumours harbouring BRAF or NRAS mutations. Overall, our results showed that NTRK gene expression can be a marker of resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibition and gives some insights of candidate genes as potential biomarkers. In addition, this study revealed an increase in Adenosine-to-Inosine editing in Alu regions and in non-repetitive regions, including the hyperediting of the MOK and DZIP3 genes in relapsed tumour samples during targeted therapy and of the ZBTB11 gene in NRAS mutated melanoma cells. Therefore, RNA editing could be a promising tool for identifying predictive markers, tumour neoantigens and targetable pathways that could help in preventing relapses during immuno- or targeted therapies.",2022 Jan,RNA Biol. 2022 Jan;19(1):996-1006. doi: 10.1080/15476286.2022.2110390.,"['Amweg A', 'Tusup M', 'Cheng P', 'Picardi E', 'Dummer R', 'Levesque MP', 'French LE', 'Guenova E', 'Läuchli S', 'Kundig T', 'Mellett M', 'Pascolo S']",True
35132959,Regulation of the double-stranded RNA response through ADAR1 licenses metaplastic reprogramming in gastric epithelium.,"Cells recognize both foreign and host-derived double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) via a signaling pathway that is usually studied in the context of viral infection. It has become increasingly clear that the sensing and handling of endogenous dsRNA is also critical for cellular differentiation and development. The adenosine RNA deaminase, ADAR1, has been implicated as a central regulator of the dsRNA response, but how regulation of the dsRNA response might mediate cell fate during injury and whether such signaling is cell intrinsic remain unclear. Here, we show that the ADAR1-mediated response to dsRNA was dramatically induced in 2 distinct injury models of gastric metaplasia. Mouse organoid and in vivo genetic models showed that ADAR1 coordinated a cell-intrinsic, epithelium-autonomous, and interferon signaling-independent dsRNA response. In addition, dsRNA accumulated within a differentiated epithelial population (chief cells) in mouse and human stomachs as these cells reprogrammed to a proliferative, reparative (metaplastic) state. Finally, chief cells required ADAR1 to reenter the cell cycle during metaplasia. Thus, cell-intrinsic ADAR1 signaling is critical for the induction of metaplasia. Because metaplasia increases cancer risk, these findings support roles for ADAR1 and the response to dsRNA in oncogenesis.",2022 Feb 8,JCI Insight. 2022 Feb 8;7(3):e153511. doi: 10.1172/jci.insight.153511.,"['Sáenz JB', 'Vargas N', 'Cho CJ', 'Mills JC']",False
35064076,Impact of ADAR-induced editing of minor viral RNA populations on replication and transmission of SARS-CoV-2.,"Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADAR) are RNA-editing enzymes that may restrict viral infection. We have utilized deep sequencing to determine adenosine to guanine (A→G) mutations, signifying ADAR activity, in clinical samples retrieved from 93 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-infected patients in the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. A→G mutations were detected in 0.035% (median) of RNA residues and were predominantly nonsynonymous. These mutations were rarely detected in the major viral population but were abundant in minor viral populations in which A→G was more prevalent than any other mutation (P < 0.001). The A→G substitutions accumulated in the spike protein gene at positions corresponding to amino acids 505 to 510 in the receptor binding motif and at amino acids 650 to 655. The frequency of A→G mutations in minor viral populations was significantly associated with low viral load (P < 0.001). We additionally analyzed A→G mutations in 288,247 SARS-CoV-2 major (consensus) sequences representing the dominant viral population. The A→G mutations observed in minor viral populations in the initial patient cohort were increasingly detected in European consensus sequences between March and June 2020 (P < 0.001) followed by a decline of these mutations in autumn and early winter (P < 0.001). We propose that ADAR-induced deamination of RNA is a significant source of mutated SARS-CoV-2 and hypothesize that the degree of RNA deamination may determine or reflect viral fitness and infectivity.",2022 Feb 8,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2022 Feb 8;119(6):e2112663119. doi: 10.1073/pnas.2112663119.,"['Ringlander J', 'Fingal J', 'Kann H', 'Prakash K', 'Rydell G', 'Andersson M', 'Martner A', 'Lindh M', 'Horal P', 'Hellstrand K', 'Kann M']",False

35267483,Differential Effects on the Translation of Immune-Related Alternatively Polyadenylated mRNAs in Melanoma and T Cells by eIF4A Inhibition.,"Targeting the translation initiation complex eIF4F, which binds the 5' cap of mRNAs, is a promising anti-cancer approach. Silvestrol, a small molecule inhibitor of eIF4A, the RNA helicase component of eIF4F, inhibits the translation of the mRNA encoding the signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) transcription factor, which, in turn, reduces the transcription of the gene encoding one of the major immune checkpoint proteins, i.e., programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) in melanoma cells. A large proportion of human genes produce multiple mRNAs differing in their 3'-ends through the use of alternative polyadenylation (APA) sites, which, when located in alternative last exons, can generate protein isoforms, as in the STAT1 gene. Here, we provide evidence that the STAT1α, but not STAT1β protein isoform generated by APA, is required for silvestrol-dependent inhibition of PD-L1 expression in interferon-γ-treated melanoma cells. Using polysome profiling in activated T cells we find that, beyond STAT1, eIF4A inhibition downregulates the translation of some important immune-related mRNAs, such as the ones encoding TIM-3, LAG-3, IDO1, CD27 or CD137, but with little effect on the ones for BTLA and ADAR-1 and no effect on the ones encoding CTLA-4, PD-1 and CD40-L. We next apply RT-qPCR and 3'-seq (RNA-seq focused on mRNA 3' ends) on polysomal RNAs to analyze in a high throughput manner the effect of eIF4A inhibition on the translation of APA isoforms. We identify about 150 genes, including TIM-3, LAG-3, AHNAK and SEMA4D, for which silvestrol differentially inhibits the translation of APA isoforms in T cells. It is therefore crucial to consider 3'-end mRNA heterogeneity in the understanding of the anti-tumor activities of eIF4A inhibitors.",2022 Feb 24,Cancers (Basel). 2022 Feb 24;14(5):1177. doi: 10.3390/cancers14051177.,"['Biswas B', 'Guemiri R', 'Cadix M', 'Labbé CM', 'Chakraborty A', 'Dutertre M', 'Robert C', 'Vagner S']",False
35048970,Spatio-temporal dynamics of intra-host variability in SARS-CoV-2 genomes.,"During the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, large-scale genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 has been useful in tracking its spread and in identifying variants of concern (VOC). Viral and host factors could contribute to variability within a host that can be captured in next-generation sequencing reads as intra-host single nucleotide variations (iSNVs). Analysing 1347 samples collected till June 2020, we recorded 16 410 iSNV sites throughout the SARS-CoV-2 genome. We found ∼42% of the iSNV sites to be reported as SNVs by 30 September 2020 in consensus sequences submitted to GISAID, which increased to ∼80% by 30th June 2021. Following this, analysis of another set of 1774 samples sequenced in India between November 2020 and May 2021 revealed that majority of the Delta (B.1.617.2) and Kappa (B.1.617.1) lineage-defining variations appeared as iSNVs before getting fixed in the population. Besides, mutations in RdRp as well as RNA-editing by APOBEC and ADAR deaminases seem to contribute to the differential prevalence of iSNVs in hosts. We also observe hyper-variability at functionally critical residues in Spike protein that could alter the antigenicity and may contribute to immune escape. Thus, tracking and functional annotation of iSNVs in ongoing genome surveillance programs could be important for early identification of potential variants of concern and actionable interventions.",2022 Feb 22,Nucleic Acids Res. 2022 Feb 22;50(3):1551-1561. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkab1297.,"['Pathak AK', 'Mishra GP', 'Uppili B', 'Walia S', 'Fatihi S', 'Abbas T', 'Banu S', 'Ghosh A', 'Kanampalliwar A', 'Jha A', 'Fatma S', 'Aggarwal S', 'Dhar MS', 'Marwal R', 'Radhakrishnan VS', 'Ponnusamy K', 'Kabra S', 'Rakshit P', 'Bhoyar RC', 'Jain A', 'Divakar MK', 'Imran M', 'Faruq M', 'Sowpati DT', 'Thukral L', 'Raghav SK', 'Mukerji M']",False

34985777,Lung fibrosis is induced in ADAR2 overexpressing mice via HuR-induced CTGF signaling.,"Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 2 (ADAR2), an RNA editing enzyme is involved in a site-selective modification of adenosine (A) to inosine (I) in double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Its role in the lungs is unknown. The phenotypic characterization of Adarb1 mice that lacked ADAR2 auto-regulation due to the deletion of editing complementary sequence (ΔECS mice) determined the functional role of ADAR2 in the lungs. ADAR2 protein expression increased in the ΔECS mice. These mice display immune cell infiltration and alveolar disorganization. The lung wet by dry ratio indicates there is no lung edema in ΔECS mice. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) analysis of ΔECS mice reveals a significant increase in neutrophils. Interestingly, ΔECS mice spontaneously develop lung fibrosis as indicated by Sirius red staining of collagen fibers in the lung sections and a significant increase in hydroxyproline level in their lungs. ADAR2 expression increased significantly in a bleomycin mouse model, implicating a role of ADAR2 in lung fibrosis. Furthermore, there is a likely possibility that the genetically modified ΔECS mice does not model the physiological or pathophysiological process of lung fibrosis. Nevertheless, this model is useful in interrogating the role of ADAR2 in the lungs. The Ctgf mRNA and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) protein significantly increased in ΔECS lungs and occurs in bronchial epithelial cells. There is a significant increase in Human antigen R (ELAVL1; HuR) protein levels in ΔECS lungs and suggests a role in stabilizing Ctgf mRNA. Lung mechanics such as total respiratory resistance, Newtonian resistance and tissue damping were increased, whereas inspiratory capacity was decreased in the ΔECS mice. Taken together, these data indicate that overexpression of ADAR2 causes spontaneous lung fibrosis via HuR-mediated CTGF signaling and implicate a role for ADAR2 auto-regulation in lung homeostasis. The identification of ADAR2 target genes in ΔECS mice would facilitate a mechanistic understanding of the role of ADAR2 in the lungs and provide a therapeutic strategy for lung fibrosis.",2022 Feb,FASEB J. 2022 Feb;36(2):e22143. doi: 10.1096/fj.202101511R.,"['Soundararajan R', 'Varanasi SM', 'Patil SS', 'Srinivas S', 'Hernández-Cuervo H', 'Czachor A', 'Bulkhi A', 'Fukumoto J', 'Galam L', 'Lockey RF', 'Kolliputi N']",False

36476255,The A-to-I editing of KPC1 promotes intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma by attenuating proteasomal processing of NF-κB1 p105 to p50.,"BACKGROUND: Aberrant RNA editing of adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) has been linked to multiple human cancers, but its role in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) remains unknown. We conducted an exome-wide investigation to search for dysregulated RNA editing that drive iCCA pathogenesis. METHODS: An integrative whole-exome and transcriptome sequencing analysis was performed to elucidate the RNA editing landscape in iCCAs. Putative RNA editing sites were validated by Sanger sequencing. In vitro and in vivo experiments were used to assess the effects of an exemplary target gene Kip1 ubiquitination-promoting complex 1 (KPC1) and its editing on iCCA cells growth and metastasis. Crosstalk between KPC1 RNA editing and NF-κB signaling was analyzed by molecular methods. RESULTS: Through integrative omics analyses, we revealed an adenosine deaminases acting on RNA 1A (ADAR1)-mediated over-editing pattern in iCCAs. ADAR1 is frequently amplified and overexpressed in iCCAs and plays oncogenic roles. Notably, we identified a novel ADAR1-mediated A-to-I editing of KPC1 transcript, which results in substitution of methionine with valine at residue 8 (p.M8V). KPC1 p.M8V editing confers loss-of-function phenotypes through blunting the tumor-suppressive role of wild-type KPC1. Mechanistically, KPC1 p.M8V weakens the affinity of KPC1 to its substrate NF-κB1 p105, thereby reducing the ubiquitinating and proteasomal processing of p105 to p50, which in turn enhances the activity of oncogenic NF-κB signaling. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings established that amplification-driven ADAR1 overexpression results in overediting of KPC1 p.M8V in iCCAs, leading to progression via activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, and suggested ADAR1-KPC1-NF-κB axis as a potential therapeutic target for iCCA.",2022 Dec 8,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2022 Dec 8;41(1):338. doi: 10.1186/s13046-022-02549-1.,"['Gao C', 'Zhou G', 'Shi J', 'Shi P', 'Jin L', 'Li Y', 'Wang X', 'Liao S', 'Yan H', 'Wu J', 'Lu Y', 'Zhai Y', 'Zhang J', 'Zhang H', 'Zhang H', 'Yang C', 'Cao P', 'Cheng S', 'Zhou G']",True

36615779,Exercise-Induced ADAR2 Protects against Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease through miR-34a.,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a growing health problem that is closely associated with insulin resistance and hereditary susceptibility. Exercise is a beneficial approach to NAFLD. However, the relief mechanism of exercise training is still unknown. In this study, mice on a normal diet or a high-fat diet (HFD), combined with Nω-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, hydrochloride (L-NAME) mice, were either kept sedentary or were subjected to a 12-week exercise running scheme. We found that exercise reduced liver steatosis in mice with diet-induced NAFLD. The hepatic adenosine deaminases acting on RNA 2 (ADAR2) were downregulated in NAFLD and were upregulated in the liver after 12-week exercise. Next, overexpression of ADAR2 inhibited and suppression promoted lipogenesis in HepG2 cells treated with oleic acid (OA), respectively. We found that ADAR2 could down-regulate mature miR-34a in hepatocytes. Functional reverse experiments further proved that miR-34a mimicry eliminated the suppression of ADAR2 overexpression in lipogenesis in vitro. Moreover, miR-34a inhibition and mimicry could also affect lipogenesis in hepatocytes. In conclusion, exercise-induced ADAR2 protects against lipogenesis during NAFLD by editing miR-34a.

ADAR is an important enzyme that binds to double-strand RNA and accounts for the conversion of Adenosine to Inosine in RNA editing. However, so far there is no report on the formation and regulatory role of rG4 on ADAR expression. Here, we identify and characterize a thermostable rG4 structure within the 5'UTR of the ADAR1 mRNA and demonstrate its formation and inhibitory role on translation in reporter gene and native gene constructs. We reveal rG4-specific helicase DHX36 interacts with this rG4 in vitro and in cells under knockdown and knockout conditions by GTFH (G-quadruplex-triggered fluorogenic hybridization) probes and modulates translation in an rG4-dependent manner.

36550502,ADAR1p110 promotes Enterovirus D68 replication through its deaminase domain and inhibition of PKR pathway.,"BACKGROUND: Severe respiratory and neurological diseases caused by human enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) pose a serious threat to public health, and there are currently no effective drugs and vaccines. Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA1 (ADAR1) has diverse biological functions in various viral infections, but its role in EV-D68 infections remains undetermined. METHODS: Rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) and human embryonic kidney 293 T (293 T) cells, and HeLa cells were used to evaluate the expression level of ADAR1 upon EV-D68 (Fermon strain) and human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3; NIH47885) infection, respectively. Knockdown through silencing RNA (siRNA) and overexpression of either ADAR1p110 or ADAR1p150 in cells were used to determine the function of the two proteins after viral infection. ADAR1p110 double-stranded RNA binding domains (dsRBDs) deletion mutation was generated using a seamless clone kit. The expression of ADAR1, EV-D68 VP1, and HPIV3 hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) proteins was identified using western blotting. The median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID(50)) was applied to detect viral titers. The transcription level of EV-D68 mRNA was analyzed using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and the viral 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR)-mediated translation was analyzed using a dual luciferase reporter system. CONCLUSION: We found that the transcription and expression of ADAR1 was inhibited upon EV-D68 infection. RNA interference of endogenous ADAR1 decreased VP1 protein expression and viral titers, while overexpression of ADAR1p110, but not ADAR1p150, facilitated viral replication. Immunofluorescence assays showed that ADAR1p110 migrated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm after EV-D68 infection. Further, ADAR1p110 lost its pro-viral ability after mutations of the active sites in the deaminase domain, and 5'-UTR sequencing of the viral genome revealed that ADAR1p110 likely plays a role in EV-D68 RNA editing. In addition, after ADAR1 knockdown, the levels of both phosphorylated double-stranded RNA dependent protein kinase (p-PKR) and phosphorylated eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (p-eIF2α) increased. Attenuated translation activity of the viral genome 5'-UTR was also observed in the dual-luciferase reporter assay. Lastly, the deletion of ADAR1p110 dsRBDs increased the level of p-PKR, which correlated with a decreased VP1 expression, indicating that the promotion of EV-D68 replication by ADAR1p110 is also related to the inhibition of PKR activation by its dsRBDs. Our study illustrates that ADAR1p110 is a novel pro-viral factor of EV-D68 replication and provides a theoretical basis for EV-D68 antiviral research.",2022 Dec 22,Virol J. 2022 Dec 22;19(1):222. doi: 10.1186/s12985-022-01952-6.,"['Zhang K', 'Wang S', 'Chen T', 'Tu Z', 'Huang X', 'Zang G', 'Wu C', 'Fan X', 'Liu J', 'Tian Y', 'Cheng Y', 'Lu N', 'Zhang G']",True
36680048,Characterization of SARS-CoV-2 Mutational Signatures from 1.5+ Million Raw Sequencing Samples.,"We present a large-scale analysis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) substitutions, considering 1,585,456 high-quality raw sequencing samples, aimed at investigating the existence and quantifying the effect of mutational processes causing mutations in SARS-CoV-2 genomes when interacting with the human host. As a result, we confirmed the presence of three well-differentiated mutational processes likely ruled by reactive oxygen species (ROS), apolipoprotein B editing complex (APOBEC), and adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR). We then evaluated the activity of these mutational processes in different continental groups, showing that some samples from Africa present a significantly higher number of substitutions, most likely due to higher APOBEC activity. We finally analyzed the activity of mutational processes across different SARS-CoV-2 variants, and we found a significantly lower number of mutations attributable to APOBEC activity in samples assigned to the Omicron variant.",2022 Dec 20,Viruses. 2022 Dec 20;15(1):7. doi: 10.3390/v15010007.,"['Aroldi A', 'Angaroni F', ""D'Aliberti D"", 'Spinelli S', 'Crespiatico I', 'Crippa V', 'Piazza R', 'Graudenzi A', 'Ramazzotti D']",False
36517866,"Genomic, transcriptomic and RNA editing analysis of human MM1 and VV2 sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.","Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is characterized by a broad phenotypic spectrum regarding symptoms, progression, and molecular features. Current sporadic CJD (sCJD) classification recognizes six main clinical-pathological phenotypes. This work investigates the molecular basis of the phenotypic heterogeneity of prion diseases through a multi-omics analysis of the two most common sCJD subtypes: MM1 and VV2. We performed DNA target sequencing on 118 genes on a cohort of 48 CJD patients and full exome RNA sequencing on post-mortem frontal cortex tissue on a subset of this cohort. DNA target sequencing identified multiple potential genetic contributors to the disease onset and phenotype, both in terms of coding, damaging-predicted variants, and enriched groups of SNPs in the whole cohort and the two subtypes. The results highlight a different functional impairment, with VV2 associated with higher impairment of the pathways related to dopamine secretion, regulation of calcium release and GABA signaling, showing some similarities with Parkinson's disease both on a genomic and a transcriptomic level. MM1 showed a gene expression profile with several traits shared with different neurodegenerative, without an apparent distinctive characteristic or similarities with a specific disease. In addition, integrating genomic and transcriptomic data led to the discovery of several sites of ADAR-mediated RNA editing events, confirming and expanding previous findings in animal models. On the transcriptomic level, this work represents the first application of RNA sequencing on CJD human brain samples. Here, a good clusterization of the transcriptomic profiles of the two subtypes was achieved, together with the finding of several differently impaired pathways between the two subtypes. The results add to the understanding of the molecular features associated with sporadic CJD and its most common subtypes, revealing strain-specific genetic signatures and functional similarities between VV2 and Parkinson's disease and providing preliminary evidence of RNA editing modifications in human sCJD.",2022 Dec 14,Acta Neuropathol Commun. 2022 Dec 14;10(1):181. doi: 10.1186/s40478-022-01483-9.,"['Tarozzi M', 'Baiardi S', 'Sala C', 'Bartoletti-Stella A', 'Parchi P', 'Capellari S', 'Castellani G']",False
36457700,Filamin A pre-mRNA editing modulates vascularization and tumor growth.,"Adenosine to inosine (A to I) editing is mediated by adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADAR) enzymes. Inosines are interpreted as guanosines by the translational machinery. Consequently, A to I editing in mRNAs can lead to their recoding and the formation of proteins not encoded in the genome. Filamin A is an actin-crosslinking protein. A to I editing in the filamin pre-mRNA leads to the exchange of a glutamine to an arginine in a highly interactive domain of the protein. However, the consequences of this editing event are still poorly understood. Here we show, using transgenic mice expressing either constitutively edited or constitutively uneditable filamin A that filamin A editing critically controls angiogenesis in tumors but also in a mouse ischemia model. Hyper-editing reduces angiogenesis, while hypoediting leads to increased angiogenesis, possibly by altering vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) turnover. Further, FLNA editing of the tumor itself seemingly affects its metastatic potential by changing its interaction with the extracellular matrix. We therefore identify filamin A editing as a critical component for angiogenesis, tumor growth, and metastasis formation.",2022 Dec 13,Mol Ther Nucleic Acids. 2022 Nov 9;30:522-534. doi: 10.1016/j.omtn.2022.11.004. eCollection 2022 Dec 13.,"['Jain M', 'Manjaly G', 'Maly K', 'de Vries MR', 'Janisiw M', 'König L', 'Nossent AY', 'Jantsch MF']",True
36457126,An AGS-associated mutation in ADAR1 catalytic domain results in early-onset and MDA5-dependent encephalopathy with IFN pathway activation in the brain.,"BACKGROUND: Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS) is a severe neurodegenerative disease with clinical features of early-onset encephalopathy and progressive loss of intellectual abilities and motor control. Gene mutations in seven protein-coding genes have been found to be associated with AGS. However, the causative role of these mutations in the early-onset neuropathogenesis has not been demonstrated in animal models, and the mechanism of neurodegeneration of AGS remains ambiguous. METHODS: Via CRISPR/Cas-9 technology, we established a mutant mouse model in which a genetic mutation found in AGS patients at the ADAR1 coding gene (Adar) loci was introduced into the mouse genome. A mouse model carrying double gene mutations encoding ADAR1 and MDA-5 was prepared using a breeding strategy. Phenotype, gene expression, RNA sequencing, innate immune pathway activation, and pathologic studies including RNA in situ hybridization (ISH) and immunohistochemistry were used for characterization of the mouse models to determine potential disease mechanisms. RESULTS: We established a mouse model bearing a mutation in the catalytic domain of ADAR1, the D1113H mutation found in AGS patients. With this mouse model, we demonstrated a causative role of this mutation for the early-onset brain injuries in AGS and determined the signaling pathway underlying the neuropathogenesis. First, this mutation altered the RNA editing profile in neural transcripts and led to robust IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression in the brain. By ISH, the brains of mutant mice showed an unusual, multifocal increased expression of ISGs that was cell-type dependent. Early-onset astrocytosis and microgliosis and later stage calcification in the deep white matter areas were observed in the mutant mice. Brain ISG activation and neuroglial reaction were completely prevented in the Adar D1113H mutant mice by blocking RNA sensing through deletion of the cytosolic RNA receptor MDA-5. CONCLUSIONS: The Adar D1113H mutation in the ADAR1 catalytic domain results in early-onset and MDA5-dependent encephalopathy with IFN pathway activation in the mouse brain.",2022 Dec 1,J Neuroinflammation. 2022 Dec 1;19(1):285. doi: 10.1186/s12974-022-02646-0.,"['Guo X', 'Steinman RA', 'Sheng Y', 'Cao G', 'Wiley CA', 'Wang Q']",True
35915245,Targeting the androgen receptor to enhance NK cell killing efficacy in bladder cancer by modulating ADAR2/circ_0001005/PD-L1 signaling.,"Although androgen receptor (AR) can influence bladder cancer (BCa) initiation and progression, its impact on tumor immune escape remains unclear. Here, we found that targeting AR could enhance natural killer (NK) cell tumor-killing efficacy by decreasing PD-L1 expression. Both antiandrogen treatment and AR knockdown effectively reduced membrane PD-LI expression to facilitate NK cell-mediated BCa cell killing by downregulating circ_0001005. Mechanistically, AR upregulated circRNA circ_0001005 expression via the RNA-editing gene ADAR2. circ_0001005 competitively sponged the miRNA miR-200a-3p to promote PD-L1 expression. A preclinical BCa xenograft mouse model further confirmed this newly identified signaling using the small molecule circ_0001005-shRNA to improve NK cell killing of BCa tumor cells. Collectively, these results suggest that targeting the newly identified ADAR2/circ_0001005/miR-200a-3p/PD-L1 pathway to impact antitumor immunity may suppress progression and boost immunotherapeutic efficacy in BCa.",2022 Dec,Cancer Gene Ther. 2022 Dec;29(12):1988-2000. doi: 10.1038/s41417-022-00506-w.

The aim of this study was to characterize and assess the role of ADAR-dependent RNA editing in mesothelioma. We found that tumors and mesothelioma primary cultures have higher ADAR-mediated RNA editing compared to mesothelial cells. Unsupervised clustering of editing in different genomic regions revealed heterogeneity between tumor samples as well as mesothelioma primary cultures. ADAR2 expression levels are higher in BRCA1-associated protein 1 wild-type tumors, with corresponding changes in RNA editing in transcripts and 3'UTR. ADAR2 knockdown and rescue models indicated a role in cell proliferation, altered cell cycle, increased sensitivity to antifolate treatment, and type-1 interferon signaling upregulation, leading to changes in the microenvironment in vivo.

Recently, several site-directed RNA editing (SDRE) systems have been developed to target disease causative point mutations by flexibly exploiting the catalytic adenosine deamination properties of ADARs. This is based on the fact that A-to-I RNA editing is essentially an adenosine-guanine transition. In contrast to genome editing, RNA editing is tunable and transient, and there are still some shortcomings that need to be addressed.

While some PCD components are prognostic in cancer, the roles of many molecules can be masked by redundancies and crosstalks between PCD pathways, impeding the development of targeted therapeutics. Recent studies characterizing these redundancies have identified PANoptosis, a unique innate immune-mediated inflammatory PCD pathway that integrates components from other PCD pathways. Here, we designed a systematic computational framework to determine the pancancer clinical significance of PANoptosis and identify targetable biomarkers. We found that high expression of PANoptosis genes was detrimental in low grade glioma (LGG) and kidney renal cell carcinoma (KIRC). ZBP1, ADAR, CASP2, CASP3, CASP4, CASP8 and GSDMD expression consistently had negative effects on prognosis in LGG across multiple survival models, while AIM2, CASP3, CASP4 and TNFRSF10 expression had negative effects for KIRC. Conversely, high expression of PANoptosis genes was beneficial in skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM), with ZBP1, NLRP1, CASP8 and GSDMD expression consistently having positive prognostic effects. As a therapeutic proof-of-concept, we treated melanoma cells with combination therapy that activates ZBP1 and showed that this treatment induced PANoptosis. Overall, through our systematic framework, we identified and validated key innate immune biomarkers from PANoptosis which can be targeted to improve patient outcomes in cancers.",2022 Dec,NAR Cancer. 2022 Nov 1;4(4):zcac033. doi: 10.1093/narcan/zcac033. eCollection 2022 Dec.,"['Mall R', 'Bynigeri RR', 'Karki R', 'Malireddi RKS', 'Sharma BR', 'Kanneganti TD']",False

The study was designed retrospectively. Only patients with conductive hearing loss and simple pars tensa perforation of the tympanic membrane were included in the study. Pure tone average (PTA), air-bone gap gain (ABG), word recognition score (WRS), ABG closure and grafts success were compared between the graft groups. Records of 111 patients were analyzed.

35941214,RNA editing facilitates the enhanced production of neoantigens during the simultaneous administration of oxaliplatin and radiotherapy in colorectal cancer.,"Most cases of colorectal cancers (CRCs) are microsatellite stable (MSS), which frequently demonstrate lower response rates to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). RNA editing produces neoantigens by altering amino acid sequences. In this study, RNA editing was induced artificially by chemoradiation therapy (CRT) to generate neoantigens in MSS CRCs. Altogether, 543 CRC specimens were systematically analyzed, and the expression pattern of ADAR1 was investigated. In vitro and in vivo experiments were also performed. The RNA editing enzyme ADAR1 was upregulated in microsatellite instability-high CRCs, leading to their high affinity for ICIs. Although ADAR1 expression was low in MSS CRC, CRT including oxaliplatin (OX) treatment upregulated RNA editing levels by inducing ADAR1. Immunohistochemistry analyses showed the upregulation of ADAR1 in patients with CRC treated with CAPOX (capecitabine + OX) radiation therapy relative to ADAR1 expression in patients with CRC treated only by surgery (p < 0.001). Compared with other regimens, CRT with OX effectively induced RNA editing in MSS CRC cell lines (HT29 and Caco2, p < 0.001) via the induction of type 1 interferon-triggered ADAR1 expression. CRT with OX promoted the RNA editing of cyclin I, a neoantigen candidate. Neoantigens can be artificially induced by RNA editing via an OX-CRT regimen.

35955853,Unifying Different Cancer Theories in a Unique Tumour Model: Chronic Inflammation and Deaminases as Meeting Points.,"The increase in cancer incidences shows that there is a need to better understand tumour heterogeneity to achieve efficient treatments. Interestingly, there are several common features among almost all types of cancers, with chronic inflammation induction and deaminase dysfunctions singled out. Deaminases are a family of enzymes with nucleotide-editing capacity, which are classified into two main groups: DNA-based and RNA-based. Remarkably, a close relationship between inflammation and the dysregulation of these molecules has been widely documented, which may explain the characteristic intratumor heterogeneity, both at DNA and transcriptional levels. Indeed, heterogeneity in cancer makes it difficult to establish a unique tumour progression model. Currently, there are three main cancer models-stochastic, hierarchic, and dynamic-although there is no consensus on which one better resembles cancer biology because they are usually overly simplified. Here, to accurately explain tumour progression, we propose interactions among chronic inflammation, deaminases dysregulation, intratumor genetic heterogeneity, cancer phenotypic plasticity, and even the previously proposed appearance of cancer stem-like cell populations in the edges of advanced solid tumour masses (instead of being the cells of origin of primary malignancies).

However, their biological role and importance have been a topic of debate for many years. The discovery of Z-DNA/RNA binding domains (Zα domains) in varied proteins that are involved in the innate immune response, such as the interferon inducible form of the RNA editing enzyme ADAR1 (p150), Z-DNA binding protein 1 (ZBP1), the fish kinase PKZ and the poxvirus inhibitor of interferon response E3L, indicates important roles of Z-DNA/RNA in immunity and self/non-self-discrimination. Such Zα domain-containing proteins recognize left-handed Z-DNA/RNA in a conformation-specific manner. Recent studies have implicated these domains in virus recognition. Given these important emerging roles for the Zα domains, it is pivotal to understand the mechanism of recognition of the Z-DNA/Z-RNA by these domains. To this end, we assessed the binding thermodynamics of Zα domain from ORF112 and ADAR1 on T(CG)3 and T(CG)6 oligonucleotides which have high propensity to adopt the Z-conformation. Our study highlights important differences in the mode of oligonucleotide binding by the two Zα domains originating from different proteins.

35922651,ADAR3 activates NF-κB signaling and promotes glioblastoma cell resistance to temozolomide.,"The RNA binding protein ADAR3 is expressed exclusively in the brain and reported to have elevated expression in tumors of patients suffering from glioblastoma compared to adjacent brain tissue. Yet, other studies have indicated that glioblastoma tumors exhibit hemizygous deletions of the genomic region encompassing ADAR3 (10p15.3). As the molecular and cellular consequences of altered ADAR3 expression are largely unknown, here we directly examined the impacts of elevated ADAR3 in a glioblastoma cell line model. Transcriptome-wide sequencing revealed 641 differentially expressed genes between control and ADAR3-expressing U87-MG glioblastoma cells. A vast majority of these genes belong to pathways involved in glioblastoma progression and are regulated by NF-κB signaling. Biochemical and molecular analysis indicated that ADAR3-expressing U87-MG cells exhibit increased NF-κB activation, and treatment with an NF-κB inhibitor abrogated the impacts of ADAR3 on gene expression. Similarly, we found that increased cell survival of ADAR3-expressing cells to temozolomide, the preferred chemotherapeutic for glioblastoma, was due to increased NF-κB activity. Aberrant constitutive NF-κB activation is a common event in glioblastoma and can impact both tumor progression and resistance to treatment. Our results suggest that elevated ADAR3 promotes NF-κB activation and a gene expression program that provides a growth advantage to glioblastoma cells.",2022 Aug 3,Sci Rep. 2022 Aug 3;12(1):13362. doi: 10.1038/s41598-022-17559-4.,"['Raghava Kurup R', 'Oakes EK', 'Vadlamani P', 'Nwosu O', 'Danthi P', 'Hundley HA']",True

We show that both ADAR1 and METTL3 are upregulated in breast cancer samples, and ADAR1 positively correlates with METTL3; ADAR1 edits METTL3 mRNA and changes its binding site to miR532-5p, leading to increased METTL3 protein, which further targets ARHGAP5, recognized by YTHDF1. Additionally, we show that loss of ADAR1 significantly inhibits breast cancer growth in vivo.

36009036,ADAR2 Protein Is Associated with Overall Survival in GBM Patients and Its Decrease Triggers the Anchorage-Independent Cell Growth Signature.,"BACKGROUND: Epitranscriptomic mechanisms, such as A-to-I RNA editing mediated by ADAR deaminases, contribute to cancer heterogeneity and patients' stratification. ADAR enzymes can change the sequence, structure, and expression of several RNAs, affecting cancer cell behavior. In glioblastoma, an overall decrease in ADAR2 RNA level/activity has been reported. However, no data on ADAR2 protein levels in GBM patient tissues are available; and most data are based on ADARs overexpression experiments. METHODS: We performed IHC analysis on GBM tissues and correlated ADAR2 levels and patients' overall survival. We silenced ADAR2 in GBM cells, studied cell behavior, and performed a gene expression/editing analysis. RESULTS: GBM tissues do not all show a low/no ADAR2 level, as expected by previous studies. Although, different amounts of ADAR2 protein were observed in different patients, with a low level correlating with a poor patient outcome. Indeed, reducing the endogenous ADAR2 protein in GBM cells promotes cell proliferation and migration and changes the cell's program to an anchorage-independent growth mode. In addition, deep-seq data and bioinformatics analysis indicated multiple RNAs are differently expressed/edited upon siADAR2.

35917336,NEIL1 Recoding due to RNA Editing Impacts Lesion-Specific Recognition and Excision.,"A-to-I RNA editing is widespread in human cells but is uncommon in the coding regions of proteins outside the nervous system. An unusual target for recoding by the adenosine deaminase ADAR1 is the pre-mRNA of the base excision DNA repair enzyme NEIL1 that results in the conversion of a lysine (K) to arginine (R) within the lesion recognition loop and alters substrate specificity. Differences in base removal by unedited (UE, K242) vs edited (Ed, R242) NEIL1 were evaluated using a series of oxidatively modified DNA bases to provide insight into the chemical and structural features of the lesion base that impact isoform-specific repair. We find that UE NEIL1 exhibits higher activity than Ed NEIL1 toward the removal of oxidized pyrimidines, such as thymine glycol, uracil glycol, 5-hydroxyuracil, and 5-hydroxymethyluracil. Gas-phase calculations indicate that the relative rates in excision track with the more stable lactim tautomer and the proton affinity of N3 of the base lesion. These trends support the contribution of tautomerization and N3 protonation in NEIL1 excision catalysis of these pyrimidine base lesions. Structurally similar but distinct substrate lesions, 5-hydroxycytosine and guanidinohydantoin, are more efficiently removed by the Ed NEIL1 isoform, consistent with the inherent differences in tautomerization, proton affinities, and lability. We also observed biphasic kinetic profiles and lack of complete base removal with specific combinations of the lesion and NEIL1 isoform, suggestive of multiple lesion binding modes. The complexity of NEIL1 isoform activity implies multiple roles for NEIL1 in safeguarding accurate repair and as an epigenetic regulator.",2022 Aug 17,J Am Chem Soc. 2022 Aug 17;144(32):14578-14589. doi: 10.1021/jacs.2c03625.

35939700,Targeted RNA editing in brainstem alleviates respiratory dysfunction in a mouse model of Rett syndrome.,"Rett syndrome is a neurological disease due to loss-of-function mutations in the transcription factor, Methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MECP2). Because overexpression of endogenous MECP2 also causes disease, we have exploited a targeted RNA-editing approach to repair patient mutations where levels of MECP2 protein will never exceed endogenous levels. Here, we have constructed adeno-associated viruses coexpressing a bioengineered wild-type ADAR2 catalytic domain (Editase(wt)) and either Mecp2-targeting or nontargeting gfp RNA guides. The viruses are introduced systemically into male mice containing a guanosine to adenosine mutation that eliminates MeCP2 protein and causes classic Rett syndrome in humans. We find that in the mutant mice injected with the Mecp2-targeting virus, the brainstem exhibits the highest RNA-editing frequency compared to other brain regions. The efficiency is sufficient to rescue MeCP2 expression and function in the brainstem of mice expressing the Mecp2-targeting virus. Correspondingly, we find that abnormal Rett-like respiratory patterns are alleviated, and survival is prolonged, compared to mice injected with the control gfp guide virus. The levels of RNA editing among most brain regions corresponds to the distribution of guide RNA rather than Editase(wt). Our results provide evidence that a targeted RNA-editing approach can alleviate a hallmark symptom in a mouse model of human disease.",2022 Aug 16,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2022 Aug 16;119(33):e2206053119. doi: 10.1073/pnas.2206053119.

35939694,dsRNA-induced condensation of antiviral proteins modulates PKR activity.,"Mammalian cells respond to dsRNA in multiple manners. One key response to dsRNA is the activation of PKR, an eIF2α kinase, which triggers translational arrest and the formation of stress granules. However, the process of PKR activation in cells is not fully understood. In response to increased endogenous or exogenous dsRNA, we observed that PKR forms novel cytosolic condensates, referred to as dsRNA-induced foci (dRIFs). dRIFs contain dsRNA, form in proportion to dsRNA, and are enhanced by longer dsRNAs. dRIFs enrich several other dsRNA-binding proteins, including ADAR1, Stau1, NLRP1, and PACT. Strikingly, dRIFs correlate with and form before translation repression by PKR and localize to regions of cells where PKR activation is initiated. We hypothesize that dRIF formation is a mechanism that cells use to enhance the sensitivity of PKR activation in response to low levels of dsRNA or to overcome viral inhibitors of PKR activation.",2022 Aug 16,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2022 Aug 16;119(33):e2204235119. doi: 10.1073/pnas.2204235119.

As persons living with HIV (PWH) are living longer, it is important to understand the influence that religiosity/spirituality has among middle-aged and older PWH. Objective: Compare the degree of religiosity/spirituality among middle-aged and older PWH and HIV-negative individuals, and to identify demographic, clinical, and psychosocial factors associated with religiosity/spirituality among PWH. Method: Baseline data on 122 PWH and 92 HIV-negative individuals (ages 36-65 years; 61.1% Non-Hispanic White) from a longitudinal study were analyzed for the current study. Recruitment occurred through HIV treatment clinics and community organizations in San Diego. Participants completed questionnaires on religiosity, spirituality, and psychosocial functioning. Independent samples t-tests, Pearson correlations, and multiple linear regression analyses were conducted to test the study objective. Results: No significant differences in religiosity/spirituality were found between PWH and HIV-negative individuals. Demographic and psychosocial variables were unrelated to religiously/spirituality among HIV-negative individuals. Among PWH, multiple linear regression models indicated higher daily spirituality was significantly associated with racial/ethnic minority membership (Hispanic/Latino, African American/Black, or Other), fewer years of estimated duration of HIV, greater social support, and higher grit. Greater engagement in private religious practices was significantly associated with racial/ethnic minority membership and higher social support. Conclusions: For PWH, being a racial/ethnic minority and having higher social support was associated with greater engagement in religious/spiritual practices. Future longitudinal studies should examine whether religion/spirituality impacts well-being across the lifespan among racial/ethnic minority groups of PWH.",2022 Aug 16,HIV Res Clin Pract. 2022 Aug 16;23(1):91-98.,"['Delgadillo JD', 'Campbell LM', 'Marquine MJ', 'Heaton A', 'Rooney AS', 'Umlauf A', 'Jeste DV', 'Moore DJ', 'Moore RC']",False

It is also a novel site of adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing by ADAR (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA). In this study, we found by exome and transcriptome sequencing that there was an abnormal RNA editing event of the BLCAP gene in colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues. The editing of BLCAP transcripts promoted the degradation of BLCAP by ubiquitination, so BLCAP could not maintain its function as a tumor suppressor gene in CRC. Moreover, our further studies revealed that BLCAP could interact with Rb1 and inhibit its phosphorylation, while the loss of repressive effect due to reduced BLCAP protein levels caused by A-to-I RNA editing facilitates the transition from G1 to S phase of the cell cycle, leading to increased cell proliferation and reduced apoptosis. Thus, A-to-I RNA editing events tend to play an essential role in CRC carcinogenesis.",2022 Aug 15,Exp Cell Res. 2022 Aug 15;417(2):113209. doi: 10.1016/j.yexcr.2022.113209.

36012303,ADAR1 Isoforms Regulate Let-7d Processing in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis.,"Double-stranded RNA adenosine deaminase 1 (ADAR1) is significantly down-regulated in fibroblasts derived from Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) patients, and its overexpression restored levels of miRNA-21, PELI1, and SPRY2. There are two ADAR1 isoforms in humans, ADAR1-p110 and ADAR1-p150, generated by an alternative promoter. Let-7d is considered an essential microRNA in Pulmonary Fibrosis (PF). In silico analysis revealed COL3A1 and SMAD2, proteins involved in the development of IPF, as Let-7d targets. We analyzed the role of ADAR1-p110 and ADAR1-p150 isoforms in the regulation of Let-7d maturation and the effect of this regulation on the expression of COL3A1 and SMAD2 in IPF fibroblast. We demonstrated that differential expression and subcellular distribution of ADAR1 isoforms in fibroblasts contribute to the up-regulation of pri-miR-Let-7d and down-regulation of mature Let-7d. Induction of overexpression of ADAR1 reestablishes the expression of pri-miR-Let-7d and Let-7d in lung fibroblasts. The reduction of mature Let-7d upregulates the expression of COL3A1 and SMAD2. Thus, ADAR1 isoforms and Let-7d could have a synergistic role in IPF, which is a promising explanation in the mechanisms of fibrosis development, and the regulation of both molecules could be used as a therapeutic approach in IPF.",2022 Aug 12,Int J Mol Sci. 2022 Aug 12;23(16):9028. doi: 10.3390/ijms23169028.,"['Díaz-Piña G', 'Rubio K', 'Ordoñez-Razo RM', 'Barreto G', 'Montes E', 'Becerril C', 'Salgado A', 'Cabrera-Fuentes H', 'Aquino-Galvez A', 'Carlos-Reyes A', 'Ruiz V']",False

The present study investigates how ADAR2-mediated A-to-I RNA editing of Flna affects actin crosslinking, cell mechanics, cellular adhesion and cell migration. Cellular assays and AFM measurements demonstrate that the edited version of FLNA increases cellular stiffness and adhesion but impairs cell migration in both, mouse fibroblasts and human tumour cells. In vitro, edited FLNA leads to increased actin crosslinking, forming actin gels of higher stress resistance.

32993422,Objective and subjective sleep measures are associated with neurocognition in aging adults with and without HIV.,"Objective: Poor sleep quality is related to worse neurocognition in older adults and in people with HIV (PWH); however, many previous studies have relied only on self-report sleep questionnaires, which are inconsistently correlated with objective sleep measures. We examined relationships between objective and subjective sleep quality and neurocognition in persons with and without HIV, aged 50 and older. Method: Eighty-five adults (PWH n = 52, HIV-negative n = 32) completed comprehensive neuropsychological testing to assess global and domain-specific neurocognition. Objective sleep quality was assessed with wrist actigraphy (total sleep time, efficiency, sleep fragmentation) for five to 14 nights. Subjective sleep quality was assessed with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Results: Objective and subjective sleep measures were unrelated (p's > 0.30). Compared to HIV-negative participants, PWH had greater sleep efficiency (80% vs. 75%, p = 0.05) and were more likely to be using prescription and/or over the counter sleep medication (p = 0.04). In the whole sample, better sleep efficiency (p < 0.01) and greater total sleep time (p = 0.05) were associated with better learning. Less sleep fragmentation was associated with better learning (p < 0.01) and recall (p = 0.04). While PWH had slightly stronger relationships between total sleep time and sleep fragmentation, it is not clear if these differences are clinically meaningful. Better subjective sleep quality was associated with better executive function (p < 0.01) and working memory (p = 0.05); this relationship was primarily driven by the HIV-negative group. Conclusions: Objective sleep quality was associated with learning and recall whereas subjective sleep quality was associated with executive function and working memory. Therefore, assessing objective and subjective sleep quality could be clinically useful, as they are both related to important domains of cognition frequently impacted in HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders as well as neurodegenerative disorders associated with aging.

Considering the correlation between drug resistance and ferroptosis, this study aims to explore the mechanism of chemotherapy resistance in glioma from the perspective of epigenetics. Because of the low expression of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) ATXN8 opposite strand (ATXN8OS) in glioma cell lines, the role of ATXN8OS was explored by the detection on ferrous iron (Fe(2+))/lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS), function experiments and assays performed with xenograft model, proving that ATXN8OS inhibited temozolomide (TMZ)-resistance of glioma. After subcellular fractionation and FISH assays revealed that ATXN8OS was mainly located in cytoplasm, we determined the RNA binding protein (RBP) of ATXN8OS as adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) via RNA binding protein immunoprecipitation (RIP), RNA pull down and western blot assays. Furthermore, we verified that ATXN8OS stabilized glutaminase 2 (GLS2) mRNA by recruiting ADAR and GLS2 restrained TMZ-resistance of glioma both in vitro and in vivo. Rescue experiments indicated that ATXN8OS modulated TMZ-resistance of glioma through GLS2. In conclusion, ATXN8OS mediated ferroptosis and regulated the TMZ-resistance of glioma via ADAR/GLS2 pathway.",2022 Aug,Brain Res Bull. 2022 Aug;186:27-37. doi: 10.1016/j.brainresbull.2022.04.005.

35697535,ADAR1 and AZIN1 RNA editing function as an oncogene and contributes to immortalization in endometrial cancer.,"OBJECTIVE: Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing is a recently described epigenetic modification, which is believed to constitute a key oncogenic mechanism in human cancers. However, its functional role and clinical significance in endometrial cancer (EC) remain unclear. METHODS: Adenosine Deaminase family Acting on RNA1 (ADAR1) expression and Antizyme inhibitor 1 (AZIN1) RNA editing were examined to clarify the correlation with clinicopathological parameters and prognosis in EC patients. The biological functions and inhibitory effects of ADAR1 knockdown were investigated in JHUCS-1 and TU-ECS-1 EC cell lines. RESULTS: ADAR1 showed significant association with worse histology (P = 0.006), and lymph vascular space involvement (P = 0.049) in EC. The level of AZIN1 RNA editing was also significantly associated with worse histology (P = 0.012). ADAR1 expression was significantly correlated with AZIN1 RNA editing level (R = 0.729, R(2) = 0.547, P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis indicated that higher ADAR1 expression along with AZIN1 RNA editing is an independent predictor of prognosis in EC patients (P = 0.015). Knockdown of ADAR1 led to increased MDA-5, RIG-I, PKR, and IRF-7 expression, which in turn resulted in increased levels of Bak and apoptosis in EC cells. CONCLUSIONS: High ADAR1 expression along with AZIN1 RNA editing could be a predictor of worse prognosis in EC.

35753353,RNA editing enzyme ADAR1 controls miR-381-3p-mediated expression of multidrug resistance protein MRP4 via regulation of circRNA in human renal cells.,"Multidrug resistance-associated protein 4 (MRP4), a member of the C subfamily of ATP-binding cassette transporters, is highly expressed in the kidneys of mammals and is responsible for renal elimination of numerous drugs. Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) has been reported to regulate gene expression by catalyzing adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing reactions; however, potential roles of ADAR1 in the regulation of MRP4 expression have not been investigated. In this study, we found that downregulation of ADAR1 increased the expression of MRP4 in human renal cells at the posttranscriptional level. Luciferase reporter assays and microarray analysis revealed that downregulation of ADAR1 reduced the levels of microRNA miR-381-3p, which led to the corresponding upregulation of MPR4 expression. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a type of closed-loop endogenous noncoding RNAs that play an essential role in gene expression by acting as miRNA sponges. We demonstrate that ADAR1 repressed the biogenesis of circRNA circHIPK3 through its adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing activity, which altered the secondary structure of the precursor of circHIPK3. Furthermore, in silico analysis suggested that circHIPK3 acts as a sponge of miR-381-3p. Indeed, we found overexpression of circHIPK3 induced the expression of MRP4 through its interference with miR-381-3p.

35851616,ADAR1 downregulation by autophagy drives senescence independently of RNA editing by enhancing p16(INK4a) levels.,"Cellular senescence plays a causal role in ageing and, in mice, depletion of p16(INK4a)-expressing senescent cells delays ageing-associated disorders(1,2). Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) are RNA-editing enzymes that are also implicated as important regulators of human ageing, and ADAR inactivation causes age-associated pathologies such as neurodegeneration in model organisms(3,4). However, the role, if any, of ADARs in cellular senescence is unknown. Here we show that ADAR1 is post-transcriptionally downregulated by autophagic degradation to promote senescence through p16(INK4a) upregulation. The ADAR1 downregulation is sufficient to drive senescence in both in vitro and in vivo models. Senescence induced by ADAR1 downregulation is p16(INK4a)-dependent and independent of its RNA-editing function. Mechanistically, ADAR1 promotes SIRT1 expression by affecting its RNA stability through HuR, an RNA-binding protein that increases the half-life and steady-state levels of its target mRNAs. SIRT1 in turn antagonizes translation of mRNA encoding p16(INK4a). Hence, downregulation of ADAR1 and SIRT1 mediates p16(INK4a) upregulation by enhancing its mRNA translation. Finally, Adar1 is downregulated during ageing of mouse tissues such as brain, ovary and intestine, and Adar1 expression correlates with Sirt1 expression in these tissues in mice. Together, our study reveals an RNA-editing-independent role for ADAR1 in the regulation of senescence by post-transcriptionally controlling p16(INK4a) expression.",2022 Aug,Nat Cell Biol. 2022 Aug;24(8):1202-1210. doi: 10.1038/s41556-022-00959-z.

35922514,RNA editing underlies genetic risk of common inflammatory diseases.,"A major challenge in human genetics is to identify the molecular mechanisms of trait-associated and disease-associated variants. To achieve this, quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping of genetic variants with intermediate molecular phenotypes such as gene expression and splicing have been widely adopted(1,2). However, despite successes, the molecular basis for a considerable fraction of trait-associated and disease-associated variants remains unclear(3,4). Here we show that ADAR-mediated adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing, a post-transcriptional event vital for suppressing cellular double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-mediated innate immune interferon responses(5-11), is an important potential mechanism underlying genetic variants associated with common inflammatory diseases. We identified and characterized 30,319 cis-RNA editing QTLs (edQTLs) across 49 human tissues. These edQTLs were significantly enriched in genome-wide association study signals for autoimmune and immune-mediated diseases. Colocalization analysis of edQTLs with disease risk loci further pinpointed key, putatively immunogenic dsRNAs formed by expected inverted repeat Alu elements as well as unexpected, highly over-represented cis-natural antisense transcripts. Furthermore, inflammatory disease risk variants, in aggregate, were associated with reduced editing of nearby dsRNAs and induced interferon responses in inflammatory diseases. This unique directional effect agrees with the established mechanism that lack of RNA editing by ADAR1 leads to the specific activation of the dsRNA sensor MDA5 and subsequent interferon responses and inflammation(7-9).

A-to-I modifications of endogenous dsRNA (mainly derived from Alu repetitive elements) prevent their recognition by cellular dsRNA sensors, thus avoiding the induction of antiviral signaling and uncontrolled IFN-I production. This process, mediated by ADAR1 activity, ensures the activation of an innate immune response against foreign (non-self) but not self nucleic acids. As a consequence, ADAR1 mutations or its de-regulated activity promote the development of autoimmune diseases and strongly impact cell growth, also leading to cancer.

However, little is known about its prognostic and regulatory roles in glioma, one of the most common types of primary brain tumors. We characterized and analyzed RNA editomes of glioblastoma and isocitrate dehydrogenase mutated (IDH-MUT) gliomas from The Cancer Genome Atlas and the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA). We showed that editing change during glioma progression was another layer of molecular alterations and that editing profiles predicted the prognosis of glioblastoma and IDH-MUT gliomas in a sex-dependent manner. Hyper-editing was associated with poor survival in females but better survival in males. Moreover, noncoding editing events impacted mRNA abundance of the host genes. Genes associated with inflammatory response (e.g., EIF2AK2, a key mediator of innate immunity) and fatty acid oxidation (e.g., acyl-CoA oxidase 1, the rate-limiting enzyme in fatty acid β-oxidation) were editing-regulated and associated with glioma progression. The above findings were further validated in CGGA samples. Establishment of the prognostic and regulatory roles of RNA editing in glioma holds promise for developing editing-based therapeutic strategies against glioma progression.

The increase of ADAR1 expression and hyper-editing activity parallel to OsHV-1 RNAs suggests a functional connection between dsRNA editing and antiviral responses. We analyzed 87 RNA-seq data sets from immuno-primed, resistant, and susceptible oysters exposed to OsHV-1 to compare the ADAR hyper-editing levels on host and viral transcripts and trace hyper-editing on the oyster genes. Host RNAs were more hyper-edited than viral RNAs, despite the increased editing of viral RNAs in late infection phases. A set of genes, representing ∼0.5% of the oyster transcriptome and including several tripartite motif-containing sequences, were constantly hyper-edited. Conversely, we identified genes involved in antiviral response, miRNA maturation, and epigenetic regulation that were hyper-edited in specific conditions only. Despite technical and biological bottlenecks that hamper the understanding of the bivalve ""RNA editome,"" available tools and technologies can be adapted to bivalve mollusks. IMPORTANCE Ostreid herpesvirus-1 (OsHV-1) is a harmful pathogen of bivalve species, such as oysters. However, knowledge is lacking about host-virus interactions at the molecular level, hampering the possibility of a correct management of viral outbreaks and related massive mortalities. Notably, OsHV-1 transcripts are massively modified by host RNA editing enzyme during infection, resulting in multiple A-to-I variations along RNAs assuming double-strand conformations. The impact of these modifications on host transcripts is, however, not completely clear. Analyzing RNA-seq data of oysters infected with OsHV-1, we revealed that ∼0.5% of the oyster transcriptome is always enzymatically modified by ADAR, whereas genes involved in antiviral response, miRNA maturation, and epigenetic regulation were hyper-edited in specific conditions only. Despite our results, relevant technical bottlenecks impair an accurate quantification of RNA editing events, making necessary an approach specifically dedicated to the progressive understanding of oyster ""RNA editome.""",2022 Apr 27,mSphere. 2022 Apr 27;7(2):e0001122. doi: 10.1128/msphere.00011-22.

RA contains a large amount of Atractylodes lancea volatile oils (Atr). In this study, we investigated whether Atr can promote mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) chondrogenic differentiation. The Atr were extracted from RA by steam distillation method, and the effect of Atr on MSCs was detected by the CCK8 assay. The optimal concentration of Atr for MSCs cultivation was 3 μg/ml. The differentially expressed miR-181a-5p was screened by miRNA microarray assay, and its mimics and inhibitors were transfected into MSCs. It was found that the inhibitor of miR-181a-5p could upregulate cartilage-specific genes such as SOX9, COL2A1, and ACAN. Meanwhile, we also found that the expression of gene editing enzyme ADAR2 was significantly increased in the chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs induced by Atr, and the bases of precursor sequence of miR-181a-5p were changed from A to G. After ADAR2 deletion, the expression of cartilage-specific genes was significantly down-regulated and the precursor sequence bases of miR-181a-5p were not changed. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that the predicted target gene of miR-181a-5p was yingyang1 (YY1), and the targeting relationship was verified by dual-luciferase reporter assay. After deleting YY1, the expression of cartilage-specific genes was significantly down-regulated. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that Atr can promote chondrogenic differentiation of MSC through regulation of the ADAR2-miR-181a-5p signaling pathway. This may provide a new insight into the possible mechanism of traditional Chinese medicine (Atr) in treating inflammatory joint diseases.",2022 Apr 21,Anat Rec (Hoboken). 2022 Apr 21. doi: 10.1002/ar.24930.,"['Ye S', 'Si W', 'Qin W', 'Yang L', 'Luo Z', 'Li Z', 'Xie Y', 'Pan H', 'Li X', 'Huang Z', 'Zhu M', 'Chen D']",True
35122924,Increase in ADAR1p110 activates the canonical Wnt signaling pathway associated with aggressive phenotype in triple negative breast cancer cells.,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) represents a challenge in the search for new therapeutic targets. TNBCs are aggressive and generate resistance to chemotherapy. Tumors of TNBC patients with poor prognosis present a high level of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA1 (ADAR1). We explore the connection of ADAR1 with the canonical Wnt signaling pathway and the effect of modulation of its expression in TNBC. Expression data from cell line sequencing (DepMap) and TCGA samples were downloaded and analyzed. We lentivirally generated an MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line that overexpress (OE) ADAR1p110 or an ADAR knockdown. Abundance of different proteins related to Wnt/β-catenin pathway and activity of nuclear β-catenin were analyzed by Western blot and luciferase TOP/FOP reporter assay, respectively. Cell invasion was analyzed by matrigel assay. In mice, we study the behavior of tumors generated from ADAR1p110 (OE) cells and tumor vascularization immunostaining were analyzed. ADAR1 connects to the canonical Wnt pathway in TNBC. ADAR1p110 overexpression decreased GSK-3β, while increasing active β-catenin. It also increased the activity of nuclear β-catenin and increased its target levels. ADAR1 knockdown has the opposite effect. MDA-MB-231 ADAR1 (OE) cells showed increased capacity of invasion. Subsequently, we observed that tumors derived from ADAR1p110 (OE) cells showed increased invasion towards the epithelium, and increased levels of Survivin and CD-31 expressed in vascular endothelial cells. These results indicate that ADAR1 overexpression alters the expression of some key components of the canonical Wnt pathway, favoring invasion and neovascularization, possibly through activation of the β-catenin, which suggests an unknown role of ADAR1p110 in aggressiveness of TNBC tumors.",2022 Apr 20,Gene. 2022 Apr 20;819:146246. doi: 10.1016/j.gene.2022.146246.

35365616,A novel mechanism for A-to-I RNA-edited AZIN1 in promoting tumor angiogenesis in colorectal cancer.,"Adenosine (A) to inosine (I) RNA editing catalyzed by adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADAR) enzymes is a post-transcriptional modification that emerged as a key player in tumorigenesis and cancer progression. Antizyme inhibitor 1 (AZIN1) is one of the most frequent A-to-I RNA alterations in many human cancers. RNA-edited AZIN1 is known to confer a gain-of-function phenotype associated with aggressive tumors. However, the functional impact of RNA-edited AZIN1 in cancer angiogenesis remains unexplored. We showed here that RNA-edited AZIN1 promoted tumor angiogenesis through the upregulation of IL-8 via in vitro and in vivo experiments. And we subsequently demonstrated that delaying c-Myc degradation by OAZ2-mediated ubiquitin-independent proteasome pathway contributed to increase mRNA level and the secretion of angiogenic factor IL-8. Our study suggests an important contribution of RNA-edited AZIN1 to the tumor vascular microenvironment and highlights its translational potential. Thus, we revealed a potential approach to explore small-molecule antagonists such as reparixin attenuating IL-8 signaling for treatment of human cancer patients detected with hyper-editing.",2022 Apr 2,Cell Death Dis. 2022 Apr 2;13(4):294. doi: 10.1038/s41419-022-04734-8.,"['Wei Y', 'Zhang H', 'Feng Q', 'Wang S', 'Shao Y', 'Wu J', 'Jin G', 'Lin W', 'Peng X', 'Xu X']",True
35403872,The E3 ubiquitin ligase SMURF2 stabilizes RNA editase ADAR1p110 and promotes its adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing function.,"Epitranscriptomic changes in RNA catalyzed by the RNA-editing enzyme ADAR1 play an essential role in the regulation of diverse molecular and cellular processes, both under physiological conditions and in disease states, including cancer. Yet, despite a growing body of evidence pointing to ADAR1 as a potential therapeutic target, the mechanisms regulating its cellular abundance and activity, particularly of its constitutively expressed and ubiquitous form, ADAR1p110, are poorly understood. Here, we report the HECT-type E3 ubiquitin ligase SMURF2 as a pivotal regulator of ADAR1p110. We show that SMURF2, which is primarily known to promote the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of its protein substrates, protects ADAR1p110 from proteolysis and promotes its A-to-I editase activity in human and mouse cells and tissues. ADAR1p110's interactome analysis performed in human cells also showed a positive influence of SMURF2 on the stability and function of ADAR1p110. Mechanistically, we found that SMURF2 directly binds, ubiquitinates and stabilizes ADAR1p110 in an E3 ubiquitin ligase-dependent manner, through ADAR1p110 ubiquitination at lysine-744 (K744). Mutation of this residue to arginine (K744R), which is also associated with several human disorders, including dyschromatosis symmetrica hereditaria (DSH) and some types of cancer, abolished SMURF2-mediated protection of ADAR1p110 from both proteasomal and lysosomal degradation and inactivated ADAR1p110-mediated RNA editing. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism underlying the regulation of ADAR1 in mammalian cells and suggest SMURF2 as a key cellular factor influencing the protein abundance, interactions and functions of ADAR1p110.",2022 Apr 11,Cell Mol Life Sci. 2022 Apr 11;79(5):237. doi: 10.1007/s00018-022-04272-8.,"['Koganti P', 'Kadali VN', 'Manikoth Ayyathan D', 'Emanuelli A', 'Paolini B', 'Levy-Cohen G', 'Blank M']",False

34319598,RNA editing enzyme adenosine deaminases acting on RNA 1 deficiency increases the sensitivity of non-small cell lung cancer cells to anlotinib by regulating CX3CR1-fractalkine expression.,"Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) has been identified to play key roles in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) progression, and can modulate the sensitivity of cancer cells to anticancer drugs. The current study aimed to investigate the effect of ADAR1 on the sensitivity of NSCLC cells to anlotinib. We established anlotinib-resistant NSCLC (NSCLC/AR) cells, including NCI-H1975/AR and A549/AR cells. Results showed that ADAR1 was significantly upregulated in NSCLC/AR cells. Genetic-knockdown of ADAR1 increased the sensitivity of NSCLC/AR cells to anlotinib by inducing cell proliferation suppression, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. Furthermore, knockdown of ADAR1 decreased the level of C-X3-C motif chemokine ligand 1 (CX3CL1) in NCI-H1975/AR and A549/AR cells after anlotinib treatment. Introduction of exogenous CX3CL1 significantly reversed the positive effect of ADAR1 deficiency on NSCLC/AR cell sensitivity, exhibited by the increase of cell viability and decrease of apoptosis. Further in-vivo study demonstrated that knockdown of ADAR1 inhibited NCI-H1975/AR cell tumorigenesis by reducing CX3CL1 expression. Collectively, ADAR1 deficiency increased the sensitivity of NSCLC/AR cells to anlotinib by downregulating CX3CL1, which might provide a potential strategy for NSCLC/AR therapy.",2022 Apr,Drug Dev Res. 2022 Apr;83(2):328-338. doi: 10.1002/ddr.21861.

35177985,Aberrant Expression of ADARB1 Facilitates Temozolomide Chemoresistance and Immune Infiltration in Glioblastoma.,"Chemoresistance, especially temozolomide (TMZ) resistance, is a major clinical challenge in the treatment of glioblastoma (GBM). Exploring the mechanisms of TMZ resistance could help us identify effective therapies. Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) are very important in RNA modification through regulating the A-to-I RNA editing. Recent studies have shown that ADARs regulate multiple neurotransmitter receptors, which have been linked with the occurrence and progress of GBM. Here, data from several bioinformatics databases demonstrated that adenosine deaminase RNA specific B1 (ADARB1), also named ADAR2, was upregulated in both GBM tissues and cells, and had the prognostic value in GBM patients. Moreover, ADARB1 was found to be involved in AKT-mediated TMZ resistance in GBM cells. The KEGG analysis of ADARB1-associated co-expressed genes showed that ADARB1 was potentially involved in the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex. TISIDB and GEPIA databases were further used to analyze the role of ADARB1 in tumor-immune system interactions in GBM. These findings deepened our understanding of the function of ADARB1 in tumorigenesis and therapeutic response in GBM.",2022,Front Pharmacol. 2022 Feb 1;13:768743. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2022.768743. eCollection 2022.,"['Lu C', 'Chen X', 'Yan Y', 'Ren X', 'Wang X', 'Peng B', 'Cai Y', 'Liang Q', 'Xu Z', 'Peng J']",True
35571247,circHtra1/miR-3960/GRB10 Axis Promotes Neuronal Loss and Immune Deficiency in Traumatic Brain Injury.,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are abundant in the brain and contribute to central nervous system diseases; however, the exact roles of circRNAs in human traumatic brain injury (TBI) have not been established. In this study, we used a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) chipset as well as in vitro and in vivo assays to characterize differentially expressed circRNAs in TBI. We detected 3035 differentially expressed circRNAs in the severe TBI group, 2362 in the moderate group, and 433 in the mild group. A ceRNA network was constructed. The circRNA has_circ_0020269 (circHtra1) was significantly upregulated after brain insults and was correlated with the severity of injury. circHtra1 inhibited cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis, and its knockdown reversed these effects. Further analyses revealed that circHtra1 functions as a miR-3960 sponge and increases the expression of GRB10, which is involved in NK cell infiltration after TBI. circHtra1 was identified as a target of the IGF-1/ADAR1 axis. Reduced expression of ADAR1 (involved in A-to-I editing) after brain insults upregulated circHtra1. Our results show that circHtra1 promotes neuronal loss by sponging miR-3960 and regulating GRB10 and apoptosis during brain insults. In addition, A-to-I editing could regulate circRNA expression profiles after TBI, and circHtra1 is a potential therapeutic target.",2022,Oxid Med Cell Longev. 2022 May 6;2022:3522492. doi: 10.1155/2022/3522492. eCollection 2022.,"['Zheng P', 'Shu L', 'Ren D', 'Kuang Z', 'Zhang Y', 'Wan J']",True
35711824,ADAR1 Prevents R-loop Accumulation-Driven ATR Pathway Activation in Ovarian Cancer.,"Adenosine (A)-to-inosine (I) RNA editing is the most prevalent RNA editing mechanism, in which adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) is a major adenosine deaminase. Increasing evidence suggests that editing dysregulation of ADAR1 plays an important role in human tumorigenesis, while the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here, we demonstrated that ADAR1 was highly expressed in ovarian cancer tissues and negatively correlated with progression free survival of ovarian cancer patients. Importantly, silence of ADAR1 repressed ovarian cancer cell growth and colony formation in vitro and inhibited ovarian cancer cell tumorigenesis in vivo. Further cell cycle and transcriptome profile analysis revealed that silence of ADAR1 in ovarian cancer cells induced cell cycle arrest at G1/G0 stage. Mechanistically, loss of ADAR1 caused R-loop abnormal accumulation, thereby contributing to single stand DNA break and ATR pathway activation. Additionally, ADAR1 interacted with DHX9 to regulate R-loop complex formation, and A-to-I editing of nascent RNA repressed R-loop formation during co-transcriptional process. Together, our results identify a novel ADAR1/R-loop/ATR axis critical for ovarian cancer progression and a potential target for ovarian cancer therapy.",2022,J Cancer. 2022 Apr 24;13(8):2397-2412. doi: 10.7150/jca.72108. eCollection 2022.,"['Cui H', 'Yi Q', 'Tian M', 'Yang HT', 'Liang Y', 'Huang J', 'Zeng Q', 'Sun W', 'Han J', 'Guo J', 'Yu Z', 'Liu W', 'Ye X']",True

35898396,ADAR1-Mediated RNA Editing and Its Role in Cancer.,"It is well known that the stability of RNA, the interaction between RNA and protein, and the correct translation of protein are significant forces that drive the transition from normal cell to malignant tumor. Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) is an RNA editing enzyme that catalyzes the deamination of adenosine to inosine (A-to-I), which is one dynamic modification that in a combinatorial manner can give rise to a very diverse transcriptome. ADAR1-mediated RNA editing is essential for survival in mammals and its dysregulation results in aberrant editing of its substrates that may affect the phenotypic changes in cancer. This overediting phenomenon occurs in many cancers, such as liver, lung, breast, and esophageal cancers, and promotes tumor progression in most cases. In addition to its editing role, ADAR1 can also play an editing-independent role, although current research on this mechanism is relatively shallowly explored in tumors. In this review, we summarize the nature of ADAR1, mechanisms of ADAR1 editing-dependent and editing-independent and implications for tumorigenesis and prognosis, and pay special attention to effects of ADAR1 on cancers by regulating non-coding RNA formation and function.",2022,Front Cell Dev Biol. 2022 Jul 11;10:956649. doi: 10.3389/fcell.2022.956649. eCollection 2022.,"['Liu J', 'Wang F', 'Zhang Y', 'Liu J', 'Zhao B']",True
36532023,ADAR1 promotes systemic sclerosis via modulating classic macrophage activation.,"INTRODUCTION: As a multisystem autoimmune disorder disease, systemic sclerosis (SSc) is characterized by inflammation and fibrosis in the skin and other internal organs. However, mechanisms underlying the inflammatory response that drives the development of SSc remain largely unknown. METHODS: ADAR1 heterozygous knockout (AD1+/-) mice and myeloid-specific ADAR1 knockout mice were used to determine the function of ADAR1 in SSc. Histopathological analyses and western blot confirmed the role of ADAR1 in bleomycin-induced increased skin and lung fibrosis. RESULTS: In this study, we discover that adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR1), a deaminase converting adenosine to inosine (i.e., RNA editing) in RNA, is abundantly expressed in macrophages in the early stage of bleomycin-induced SSc. Importantly, ADAR1 is essential for SSc formation and indispensable for classical macrophage activation because ADAR1 deficiency in macrophages significantly ameliorates skin and lung sclerosis and inhibits the expression of inflammation mediator inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and IL-1β in macrophages. Mechanistically, deletion of ADAR1 blocks macrophage activation through diminishing NF-κB signaling. DISCUSSION: Our studies reveal that ADAR1 promotes macrophage activation in the onset of SSc. Thus, targeting ADAR1 could be a potential novel therapeutic strategy for treating sclerosis formation.",2022,Front Immunol. 2022 Dec 1;13:1051254. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2022.1051254. eCollection 2022.,"['Sun C', 'Cai D', 'Chen SY']",False
36582505,ADAR1 Inhibits HBV DNA Replication via Regulating miR-122-5p in Palmitic Acid Treated HepG2.2.15 Cells.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Changes in living standards and diet structure, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is prevalent globally, including in Asia, where chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is endemic. As such, cooccurrence of NAFLD with CHB is common in Asia. However, the pathogenesis underlying the onset of fatty liver in CHB prognosis has not been fully elucidated. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the effects and mechanisms of lipotoxicity on hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA replication. METHODS: The expression of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA-1 (ADAR1) and miR-122 was evaluated in liver tissues from patients with CHB concurrent NAFLD. Palmitic acid-treated HepG2.2.15 cells were used as the cell model. The effect of lipotoxicity on HBV DNA replication was evaluated in vitro by transfecting the ADAR1 overexpression or knockdown lentiviral vector into HepG2.2.15 cells, respectively. qRT-PCR, western blotting and immunofluorescence were performed to determine ADAR1 expression. RESULTS: The expression of ADAR1 in the liver tissues of CHB patients with concurrent NAFLD was significantly down-regulated compared with that in CHB patients. Enforced expression of ADAR1 inhibited the HBV DNA replication, whereas ADAR1 knockdown resulted in increased HBV DNA expression in palmitic acid - treated HepG2.2.15 cells. Additionally, ADAR1 inhibited the HBV DNA replication by upregulating miR-122, which is most abundant in the liver and mainly inhibits HBV DNA replication. CONCLUSIONS: ADAR1 may act as a suppressor of HBV replication in palmitic acid -treated HepG2.2.15 cells by increasing miR-122 levels. Thus, ADAR1 may serve as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for CHB with concurrent NAFLD.",2022,Diabetes Metab Syndr Obes. 2022 Dec 23;15:4035-4047. doi: 10.2147/DMSO.S373385. eCollection 2022.,"['Yang H', 'Rui F', 'Li R', 'Yin S', 'Xue Q', 'Hu X', 'Xu Y', 'Wu C', 'Shi J', 'Li J']",True
36743290,Characterizing microRNA editing and mutation sites in Autism Spectrum Disorder.,"Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder whose pathogenesis is still unclear. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a kind of endogenous small non-coding RNAs that play important roles in the post-transcriptional regulation of genes. Recent researches show that miRNAs are edited in multiple ways especially in central nervous systems. A-to-I editing of RNA catalyzed by Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) happens intensively in brain and is also noticed in other organs and tissues. Although miRNAs are widely edited in human brain, miRNA editing in ASD is still largely unexplored. In order to reveal the editing events of miRNAs in ASD, we analyzed 131 miRNA-seq samples from 8 different brain regions of ASD patients and normal controls. We identified 834 editing sites with significant editing levels, of which 70 sites showed significantly different editing levels in the superior frontal gyrus samples of ASD patients (ASD-SFG) when compared with those of control samples. The editing level of an A-to-I editing site in hsa-mir-376a-1 (hsa-mir-376a-1_9_A_g) in ASD-SFG is higher than that of normal controls, and the difference is exaggerated in individuals under 10 years. The increased expression of ADAR1 is consistent with the increased editing level of hsa-mir-376a-1_9_A_g in ASD-SFG samples compared to normal SFG samples. Furthermore, we verify that A-to-I edited hsa-mir-376a-5p directly represses GPR85 and NAPB, which may contribute to the abnormal neuronal development of ASD patients.

36908580,Hippocampal ceRNA networks from chronic intermittent ethanol vapor-exposed male mice and functional analysis of top-ranked lncRNA genes for ethanol drinking phenotypes.,"The molecular mechanisms regulating the development and progression of alcohol use disorder (AUD) are largely unknown. While noncoding RNAs have previously been implicated as playing key roles in AUD, long-noncoding RNA (lncRNA) remains understudied in relation to AUD. In this study, we first identified ethanol-responsive lncRNAs in the mouse hippocampus that are transcriptional network hub genes. Microarray analysis of lncRNA, miRNA, circular RNA, and protein coding gene expression in the hippocampus from chronic intermittent ethanol vapor- or air- (control) exposed mice was used to identify ethanol-responsive competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks. Highly interconnected lncRNAs (genes that had the strongest overall correlation to all other dysregulated genes identified) were ranked. The top four lncRNAs were novel, previously uncharacterized genes named Gm42575, 4930413E15Rik, Gm15767, and Gm33447, hereafter referred to as Pitt1, Pitt2, Pitt3, and Pitt4, respectively. We subsequently tested the hypothesis that CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis of the putative promoter and first exon of these lncRNAs in C57BL/6J mice would alter ethanol drinking behavior. The Drinking in the Dark (DID) assay was used to examine binge-like drinking behavior, and the Every-Other-Day Two-Bottle Choice (EOD-2BC) assay was used to examine intermittent ethanol consumption and preference. No significant differences between control and mutant mice were observed in the DID assay. Female-specific reductions in ethanol consumption were observed in the EOD-2BC assay for Pitt1, Pitt3, and Pitt4 mutant mice compared to controls. Male-specific alterations in ethanol preference were observed for Pitt1 and Pitt2. Female-specific increases in ethanol preference were observed for Pitt3 and Pitt4. Total fluid consumption was reduced in Pitt1 and Pitt2 mutants at 15% v/v ethanol and in Pitt3 and Pitt4 at 20% v/v ethanol in females only. We conclude that all lncRNAs targeted altered ethanol drinking behavior, and that lncRNAs Pitt1, Pitt3, and Pitt4 influenced ethanol consumption in a sex-specific manner. Further research is necessary to elucidate the biological mechanisms for these effects. These findings add to the literature implicating noncoding RNAs in AUD and suggest lncRNAs also play an important regulatory role in the disease.",2022,Adv Drug Alcohol Res. 2022;2:10831. doi: 10.3389/adar.2022.10831.

Oligonucleotide-based therapeutics hold particular promise for treating incurable muscular dystrophies, including Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). DMD is a severe monogenic disease triggered by deletions, duplications, or point mutations in the DMD gene, which encodes a membrane-linked cytoskeletal protein to protect muscle fibers from contraction-induced injury. Patients with DMD inevitably succumb to muscle degeneration and atrophy early in life, leading to premature death from cardiac and respiratory failure. Thus far, the disease has thwarted all curative strategies. Transcriptomic manipulation, employing exon skipping using antisense oligonucleotides (ASO), has made significant progress in the search for DMD therapeutics. Several exon-skipping drugs employing RNA manipulation technology have been approved by regulatory agencies and have shown promise in clinical trials.

35935998,IFN-I inducible miR-3614-5p targets ADAR1 isoforms and fine tunes innate immune activation.,"Regulation of innate immune responses is essential for maintenance of immune homeostasis and development of an appropriate immunity against microbial infection. We show here that miR-3614-5p, product of the TRIM25 host gene, is induced by type I interferon (IFN-I) in several human non-immune and immune cell types, in particular in primary myeloid cells. Studies in HeLa cells showed that miR-3614-5p represses both p110 and p150 ADAR1 and reduces constitutive and IFN-induced A-to-I RNA editing. In line with this, activation of innate sensors and expression of IFN-β and the pro-inflammatory IL-6 are promoted. MiR-3614-5p directly targets ADAR1 transcripts by binding to one specific site in the 3'UTR. Moreover, we could show that endogenous miR-3614-5p is associated with Ago2 and targets ADAR1 in IFN-stimulated cells. Overall, we propose that, by reducing ADAR1, IFN-I-induced miR-3614-5p contributes to lowering the activation threshold of innate sensors.

36034848,Distinct alterations of fecal microbiota refer to the efficacy of adalimumab in Crohn's disease.,"Background and Aims: Anti-tumor necrosis factor mAb (i.e., adalimumab, ADA) is currently used in the treatment of patients with Crohn's disease (CD). However, its regulation on fecal microbiota is still not fully understood. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 115 patients with CD who received treatment with ADA for 12 weeks at the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Center in Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital and Department of Gastroenterology in Shanghai General Hospital. The Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) evaluation was applied to patients before ADA therapy at week 0, 4, 8, and 12. Clinical remission (CR) was defined as the CDAI < 150. All patients underwent ileocolonoscopy or enteroscopy at baseline (week 0) and week 12. Crohn's Disease Endoscopic Index of Severity (CDEIS) scores were calculated by two experienced physicians to assess endoscopic activity. Mucosal healing (MH) was assigned a CDEIS score between 0 and 3. Fecal samples were collected from eight CD patients at baseline and week 12, and the microbiota was analyzed by using 16S RNA sequencing. Results: At week 12, CR was achieved in 70.6% (72/102) of the patients with active CD. A total of 47.1% (48/102) of the patients with active CD attained MH, among which, 56.6% (30/53) of the patients with mildly active CD (3 ≤ CDEIS <9) and 48.0% (12/25) of the moderately active CD patients (9 ≤ CDEIS <12) attained MH, but only 25.0% (6/24) achieved MH in severely active CD patients (CDEIS ≥12). The efficacy of ADA was not associated with lesion locations (χ (2) = 0.409, p = 0.815). Unexpectedly, we found an increase in protective microbiota at the genus level (e.g., Barnesiella, Anaerostipes, Tyzzerella, Lachnoclostridium, and Lachnospiraceae_unclassified) but a decrease in pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia-Shigella) in fecal samples of the ADA-responsive group (ADA-R) when compared with those in the ADA-nonresponsive group (ADA-NR). Notably, the gene bglX coding β-glucosidase and gph encoding phosphoglycolate phosphatase were enriched in fecal samples of ADA-R. Conversely, the abundance of genes coding ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter system proteins was significantly enriched in fecal samples of ADA-NR when compared with that of the ADA-R. Conclusion: This study reveals that ADA markedly improves clinical remission and induces MH in mildly to moderately active CD patients and that distinct changes in the gut microbiota can be used to predict the efficacy of ADA.",2022,Front Pharmacol. 2022 Aug 11;13:913720. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2022.913720. eCollection 2022.,"['Chen L', 'Lu Z', 'Kang D', 'Feng Z', 'Li G', 'Sun M', 'Liu Z', 'Wu W', 'Fang L']",True

Theoretically targetable to any RNA type and site, its flexibility and reversibility makes it a potentially powerful gene editing tool. RNA editing offers a host of potential advantages in specific niches when compared to currently available alternative gene manipulation techniques. Unlike DNA editors, which are currently too large to be delivered in vivo using a viral vector, smaller RNA editors fit easily within the capabilities of an adeno-associated virus (AAV). Unlike gene augmentation, which is limited by gene size and viral packaging constraints, RNA editing may correct transcripts too long to fit within a viral vector. In this article we examine the development of RNA editing and discuss potential applications and pitfalls.

36177442,Buprenorphine as a Treatment for Major Depression and Opioid Use Disorder.,"Rates of major depressive disorder (MDD) are disproportionally high in subjects with opioid use disorder (OUD) relative to the general population. MDD is often more severe in OUD patients, leading to compliance issues with maintenance therapies and poor outcomes. A growing body of literature suggests that endogenous opioid system dysregulation may play a role in the emergence of MDD. Buprenorphine, a mixed opioid receptor agonist/antagonist approved for the treatment of OUD and chronic pain, may have potential as a novel therapeutic for MDD, especially for patients with a dual diagnosis of MDD and OUD. This paper presents a comprehensive review of papers relevant to the assessment of buprenorphine as a treatment for MDD, OUD, and/or suicide compiled using electronic databases per Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The principal goal of this literature review was to compile the clinical studies that have interrogated the antidepressant activity of buprenorphine in opioid naïve MDD patients and OUD patients with comorbid MDD. Evidence supporting buprenorphine's superiority over methadone for treating comorbid OUD and MDD was also considered. Finally, recent evidence for the ability of buprenorphine to alleviate suicidal ideation in both opioid-naïve patients and opioid-experienced patients was evaluated. Synthesizing all of this information, buprenorphine emerges as a potentially effective therapeutic for the dual purposes of treating MDD and OUD.",2022,Adv Drug Alcohol Res. 2022;2:10254. doi: 10.3389/adar.2022.10254.

36199571,Identification and analysis of microRNA editing events in recurrent bladder cancer based on RNA sequencing: MicroRNA editing level is a potential novel biomarker.,"Background: With the continued advancement of RNA-seq (RNA-sequencing), microRNA (miRNA) editing events have been demonstrated to play an important role in different malignancies. However, there is yet no description of the miRNA editing events in recurrent bladder cancer. Objective: To identify and compare miRNA editing events in primary and recurrent bladder cancer, as well as to investigate the potential molecular mechanism and its impact on patient prognosis. Methods: We examined the mRNA and miRNA transcriptomes of 12 recurrent bladder cancer cases and 13 primary bladder cancer cases. The differentially expressed mRNA sequences were analyzed. Furthermore, we identified the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in recurrent bladder cancer. The Gene Ontology (GO) functional enrichment analyses on DEGs and gene set enrichment analysis were performed. The consensus molecular subtype (CMS) classification of bladder cancer was identified using the Consensus MIBC package in R (4.1.0); miRNA sequences were then further subjected to differentially expressed analysis and pathway enrichment analysis. MiRNA editing events were identified using miRge3.0. miRDB and TargetScanHuman were used to predict the downstream targets of specific differentially edited or expressed miRNAs. The expression levels of miR-154-5p and ADAR were validated by RT-qPCR. Finally, survival and co-expression studies were performed on the TCGA-BLCA cohort. Results: First, the mRNA expression levels in recurrent bladder cancer changed significantly, supporting progression via related molecular signal pathways. Second, significantly altered miRNAs in recurrent bladder cancer were identified, with miR-154-5p showing the highest level of editing in recurrent bladder cancer and may up-regulate the expression levels of downstream targets HS3ST3A1, AQP9, MYLK, and RAB23. The survival analysis results of TCGA data revealed that highly expressed HS3ST3A1 and RAB23 exhibited poor prognosis. In addition, miR-154 editing events were found to be significant to CMS classification. Conclusion: MiRNA editing in recurrent bladder cancer was detected and linked with poor patient prognosis, providing a reference for further uncovering the intricate molecular mechanism in recurrent bladder cancer. Therefore, inhibiting A-to-I editing of miRNA may be a viable target for bladder cancer treatment, allowing current treatment choices to be expanded and individualized.",2022,Front Genet. 2022 Sep 19;13:984279. doi: 10.3389/fgene.2022.984279. eCollection 2022.,"['Qin JX', 'Liu X', 'Wang XL', 'Wang GY', 'Liang Q', 'Dong Y', 'Pang K', 'Hao L', 'Xue L', 'Zhao Y', 'Hu ZX', 'Li R', 'Lv Q', 'Chao L', 'Meng FL', 'Shi ZD', 'Han CH']",True
36237573,Combining affinity purification and mass spectrometry to define the network of the nuclear proteins interacting with the N-terminal region of FMRP.,"Fragile X-Syndrome (FXS) represents the most common inherited form of intellectual disability and the leading monogenic cause of Autism Spectrum Disorders. In most cases, this disease results from the absence of expression of the protein FMRP encoded by the FMR1 gene (Fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1). FMRP is mainly defined as a cytoplasmic RNA-binding protein regulating the local translation of thousands of target mRNAs. Interestingly, FMRP is also able to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. However, to date, its roles in the nucleus of mammalian neurons are just emerging. To broaden our insight into the contribution of nuclear FMRP in mammalian neuronal physiology, we identified here a nuclear interactome of the protein by combining subcellular fractionation of rat forebrains with pull- down affinity purification and mass spectrometry analysis. By this approach, we listed 55 candidate nuclear partners. This interactome includes known nuclear FMRP-binding proteins as Adar or Rbm14 as well as several novel candidates, notably Ddx41, Poldip3, or Hnrnpa3 that we further validated by target-specific approaches. Through our approach, we identified factors involved in different steps of mRNA biogenesis, as transcription, splicing, editing or nuclear export, revealing a potential central regulatory function of FMRP in the biogenesis of its target mRNAs. Therefore, our work considerably enlarges the nuclear proteins interaction network of FMRP in mammalian neurons and lays the basis for exciting future mechanistic studies deepening the roles of nuclear FMRP in neuronal physiology and the etiology of the FXS.",2022,Front Mol Biosci. 2022 Sep 27;9:954087. doi: 10.3389/fmolb.2022.954087. eCollection 2022.,"['Kieffer F', 'Hilal F', 'Gay AS', 'Debayle D', 'Pronot M', 'Poupon G', 'Lacagne I', 'Bardoni B', 'Martin S', 'Gwizdek C']",False
36277748,Proteomics and bioinformatics analysis of cardiovascular related proteins in offspring exposed to gestational diabetes mellitus.,"INTRODUCTION: Previous studies have demonstrated that exposed to the initial suboptimal intrauterine environment of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) may increase risk of cardiovascular disease in adulthood. METHODS: In order to investigate the underlying mechanisms involved in the increased risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) in the offspring of GDM, we applied a high-throughput proteomics approach to compare the proteomic expression profile of human umbilical vessels of normal and GDM offspring. RESULTS: A total of significantly different 100 proteins were identified in umbilical vessels from GDM group compared with normal controls, among which 31 proteins were up-regulated, while 69 proteins were down-regulated. Differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) are validated using Western blotting analysis. The analysis of these differently expressed proteins (DEPs) related diseases and functions results, performed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software. Based on ""Diseases and Disorders"" analysis, 17 proteins (ACTA2, ADAR, CBFB, DDAH1, FBN1, FGA, FGB, FGG, GLS, GSTM1, HBB, PGM3, PPP1R13L, S100A8, SLC12A4, TPP2, VCAN) were described to be associated with CVD, especially in Anemia, Thrombus and Myocardial infarction. Functional analysis indicated that DEPs involved in many cardiovascular functions, especially in ""vasoconstriction of blood vessel"" (related DEPs: ACTA2, DDAH1, FBN1, FGA, FGB, and FGG).

36398055,"The ""Janus-like"" RNA-editing machinery in innate antiviral immunity.","Our innate immune systems are evolved to provide the first line of immune defense against microbial infections. A key effector component is the adenosine deaminase acting on the RNA-1 (ADAR-1)/interferon (IFN) pathway of the innate cytoplasmic immunity that mounts rapid responses to many viral pathogens. As an RNA-editing enzyme, ADAR-1 targets viral RNA intermediates in the cytoplasmic compartment to interfere with the infection. However, ADAR-1 may also edit characteristic RNA structures of certain host genes, notably, the 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) receptor 2C (5-HT(2C)R). Dysfunction of 5-HT(2C)R has been linked to the pathology of several human mental conditions, such as Schizophrenia, anxiety, bipolar disorder, major depression, and the mental illnesses of substance use disorders (SUD). Thus, the ADAR-1-mediated RNA editing may be either beneficial or harmful; these effects need to be tightly modulated to sustain innate antiviral immunity while restricting undesired off-target self-reactivity. In this communication, we discuss ideas and tools to identify the orphan drug candidates, including small molecules and biologics that may serve as effective modulators of the ADAR-1/IFN innate immunity and are thereby promising for use in treating or preventing SUD- and/or viral infection-associated mental illnesses.",2022,Curr Trends Immunol. 2022;23:23-32.,"['Wu L', 'Wang D']",False

Therefore, it is of great significance to understand how mutations drive the virulence of HIV. Based on the 11897 reliable genomes of HIV-1 retrieved from HIV sequence Database, we analyze the 12 types of point mutation (A>C, A>G, A>T, C>A, C>G, C>T, G>A, G>C, G>T, T>A, T>C, T>G) from multiple statistical perspectives for the first time. The global/geographical location/subtype/k-mer analysis results report that A>G, G>A, C>T and T>C account for nearly 64% among all SNPs, which suggest that APOBEC-editing and ADAR-editing may play an important role in HIV-1 infectivity. Time analysis shows that most genomes with abnormal mutation numbers comes from African countries. Finally, we use natural vector method to check the k-mer distribution changing patterns in the genome, and find that there is an important substitution pattern between nucleotides A and G, and 2-mer CG may have a significant impact on viral infectivity.

36518246,ADAR1-dependent editing regulates human β cell transcriptome diversity during inflammation.,"INTRODUCTION: Enterovirus infection has long been suspected as a possible trigger for type 1 diabetes. Upon infection, viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is recognized by membrane and cytosolic sensors that orchestrate type I interferon signaling and the recruitment of innate immune cells to the pancreatic islets. In this context, adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) editing plays an important role in dampening the immune response by inducing adenosine mispairing, destabilizing the RNA duplexes and thus preventing excessive immune activation. METHODS: Using high-throughput RNA sequencing data from human islets and EndoC-βH1 cells exposed to IFNα or IFNγ/IL1β, we evaluated the role of ADAR1 in human pancreatic β cells and determined the impact of the type 1 diabetes pathophysiological environment on ADAR1-dependent RNA editing. RESULTS: We show that both IFNα and IFNγ/IL1β stimulation promote ADAR1 expression and increase the A-to-I RNA editing of Alu-Containing mRNAs in EndoC-βH1 cells as well as in primary human islets. DISCUSSION: We demonstrate that ADAR1 overexpression inhibits type I interferon response signaling, while ADAR1 silencing potentiates IFNα effects. In addition, ADAR1 overexpression triggers the generation of alternatively spliced mRNAs, highlighting a novel role for ADAR1 as a regulator of the β cell transcriptome under inflammatory conditions.",2022,Front Endocrinol (Lausanne). 2022 Nov 28;13:1058345. doi: 10.3389/fendo.2022.1058345. eCollection 2022.,"['Szymczak F', 'Cohen-Fultheim R', 'Thomaidou S', 'de Brachène AC', 'Castela A', 'Colli M', 'Marchetti P', 'Levanon E', 'Eizirik D', 'Zaldumbide A']",False

36684421,ADAR RNA editing on antisense RNAs results in apparent U-to-C base changes on overlapping sense transcripts.,"Despite hundreds of RNA modifications described to date, only RNA editing results in a change in the nucleotide sequence of RNA molecules compared to the genome. In mammals, two kinds of RNA editing have been described so far, adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) and cytidine to uridine (C-to-U) editing. Recent improvements in RNA sequencing technologies have led to the discovery of a continuously growing number of editing sites. These methods are powerful but not error-free, making routine validation of newly-described editing sites necessary. During one of these validations on DDX58 mRNA, along with A-to-I RNA editing sites, we encountered putative U-to-C editing. These U-to-C edits were present in several cell lines and appeared regulated in response to specific environmental stimuli. The same findings were also observed for the human long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (hLincRNA-p21). A more in-depth analysis revealed that putative U-to-C edits result from A-to-I editing on overlapping antisense RNAs that are transcribed from the same loci. Such editing events, occurring on overlapping genes transcribed in opposite directions, have recently been demonstrated to be immunogenic and have been linked with autoimmune and immune-related diseases. Our findings, also confirmed by deep transcriptome data, demonstrate that such loci can be recognized simply through the presence of A-to-I and U-to-C mismatches within the same locus, reflective A-to-I editing both in the sense-oriented transcript and in the cis-natural antisense transcript (cis-NAT), implying that such clusters could be a mark of functionally relevant ADAR1 editing events.",2022,Front Cell Dev Biol. 2023 Jan 6;10:1080626. doi: 10.3389/fcell.2022.1080626. eCollection 2022.,"['Pecori R', 'Chillón I', 'Lo Giudice C', 'Arnold A', 'Wüst S', 'Binder M', 'Marcia M', 'Picardi E', 'Papavasiliou FN']",True

We hypothesized that the use of fluoroquinolones is associated with aortic aneurysm (AA) and aortic dissection or aortic rupture (AD/AR). We performed a systematic review with meta-analysis on studies published until March 2019. Seven observational studies were included, comprising 2,851,646 participants. The studies were evaluated regarding their risk of bias. Results on fluoroquinolone use risk comparing with nontreatment and with beta-lactam antibiotic use were extracted. The estimates were pooled through a random-effects model meta-analysis and heterogeneity assessed through the I(2) statistic. Sensitivity analysis were performed, grouping studies per design and with exclusion of studies with critical risk of bias. Fluoroquinolone use was associated with a higher risk of AA/AD/AR, comparing with a nontreatment intervention (odds ratio = 2.26; 95%CI 1.93-2.65; I(2) = 30%) and comparing with a beta-lactam intervention (odds ratio = 1.56; 95%CI 1.37-1.79; I(2) = 0%).

34346762,Marburg and Ebola Virus mRNA 3' Untranslated Regions Contain Negative Regulators of Translation That Are Modulated by ADAR1 Editing.,"The filovirus family includes deadly pathogens such as Ebola virus (EBOV) and Marburg virus (MARV). A substantial portion of filovirus genomes encode 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of viral mRNAs. Select viral genomic RNA sequences corresponding to 3' UTRs are prone to editing by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1). A reporter mRNA approach, in which different 5' or 3' UTRs were inserted into luciferase-encoding mRNAs, demonstrates that MARV 3' UTRs yield different levels of reporter gene expression, suggesting modulation of translation. The modulation occurs in cells unable to produce microRNAs (miRNAs) and can be recapitulated in a MARV minigenome assay. Deletion mutants identified negative regulatory regions at the ends of the MARV nucleoprotein (NP) and large protein (L) 3' UTRs. Apparent ADAR1 editing mutants were previously identified within the MARV NP 3' UTR. Introduction of these changes into the MARV nucleoprotein (NP) 3' UTR or deletion of the region targeted for editing enhances translation, as indicated by reporter assays and polysome analysis. In addition, the parental NP 3' UTR, but not the edited or deletion mutant NP 3' UTRs, induces a type I interferon (IFN) response upon transfection into cells. Because some EBOV isolates from the West Africa outbreak exhibited ADAR1 editing of the viral protein of 40 kDa (VP40) 3' UTR, VP40 3' UTRs with parental and edited sequences were similarly assayed. The EBOV VP40 3' UTR edits also enhanced translation, but neither the wild-type nor the edited 3' UTRs induced IFN. These findings implicate filoviral mRNA 3' UTRs as negative regulators of translation that can be inactivated by innate immune responses that induce ADAR1. IMPORTANCE UTRs comprise a large percentage of filovirus genomes and are apparent targets of editing by ADAR1, an enzyme with pro- and antiviral activities. However, the functional significance of the UTRs and ADAR1 editing has been uncertain. This study demonstrates that MARV and EBOV 3' UTRs can modulate translation, in some cases negatively. ADAR1 editing or deletion of select regions within the translation suppressing 3' UTRs relieves the negative effects of the UTRs. These data indicate that filovirus 3' UTRs contain translation regulatory elements that are modulated by activation of ADAR1, suggesting a complex interplay between filovirus gene expression and innate immunity.",2021 Sep 9,J Virol. 2021 Sep 9;95(19):e0065221. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00652-21.

34496885,An ADAR1-dependent RNA editing event in the cyclin-dependent kinase CDK13 promotes thyroid cancer hallmarks.,"BACKGROUND: Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) modify many cellular RNAs by catalyzing the conversion of adenosine to inosine (A-to-I), and their deregulation is associated with several cancers. We recently showed that A-to-I editing is elevated in thyroid tumors and that ADAR1 is functionally important for thyroid cancer cell progression. The downstream effectors regulated or edited by ADAR1 and the significance of ADAR1 deregulation in thyroid cancer remain, however, poorly defined. METHODS: We performed whole transcriptome sequencing to determine the consequences of ADAR1 deregulation for global gene expression, RNA splicing and editing. The effects of gene silencing or RNA editing were investigated by analyzing cell viability, proliferation, invasion and subnuclear localization, and by protein and gene expression analysis. RESULTS: We report an oncogenic function for CDK13 in thyroid cancer and identify a new ADAR1-dependent RNA editing event that occurs in the coding region of its transcript. CDK13 was significantly over-edited (c.308A > G) in tumor samples and functional analysis revealed that this editing event promoted cancer cell hallmarks. Finally, we show that CDK13 editing increases the nucleolar abundance of the protein, and that this event might explain, at least partly, the global change in splicing produced by ADAR1 deregulation. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our data support A-to-I editing as an important pathway in cancer progression and highlight novel mechanisms that might be used therapeutically in thyroid and other cancers.",2021 Sep 8,Mol Cancer. 2021 Sep 8;20(1):115. doi: 10.1186/s12943-021-01401-y.,"['Ramírez-Moya J', 'Miliotis C', 'Baker AR', 'Gregory RI', 'Slack FJ', 'Santisteban P']",False
34297039,ADAR and hnRNPC deficiency synergize in activating endogenous dsRNA-induced type I IFN responses.,"Cytosolic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) initiates type I IFN responses. Endogenous retroelements, notably Alu elements, constitute a source of dsRNA. Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing by ADAR induces mismatches in dsRNA and prevents recognition by MDA5 and autoinflammation. To identify additional endogenous dsRNA checkpoints, we conducted a candidate screen in THP-1 monocytes and found that hnRNPC and ADAR deficiency resulted in synergistic induction of MDA5-dependent IFN responses. RNA-seq analysis demonstrated dysregulation of Alu-containing introns in hnRNPC-deficient cells via utilization of unmasked cryptic splice sites, including introns containing ADAR-dependent A-to-I editing clusters. These putative MDA5 ligands showed reduced editing in the absence of ADAR, providing a plausible mechanism for the combined effects of hnRNPC and ADAR. This study contributes to our understanding of the control of repetitive element-induced autoinflammation and suggests that patients with hnRNPC-mutated tumors might maximally benefit from ADAR inhibition-based immunotherapy.",2021 Sep 6,J Exp Med. 2021 Sep 6;218(9):e20201833. doi: 10.1084/jem.20201833.

Despite similarities in genome structure, in the number of genes and in the diverse transcriptomic architectures, we measured a ten-fold higher transcript variability in HaHV-1, with more extended antisense gene transcription. Transcriptional dynamics also appeared different, both in timing and expression trends. Both viruses were heavily affected by post-transcriptional modifications performed by ADAR1 affecting sense-antisense gene pairs forming dsRNAs. However, OsHV-1 concentrated these modifications in a few genomic hotspots, whereas HaHV-1 diluted ADAR1 impact by elongated and polycistronic transcripts distributed over its whole genome. These transcriptional strategies might thus provide alternative potential roles for sense-antisense transcription in viral transcriptomes to evade the host's immune response in different virus-host combinations.",2021 Sep 30,Viruses. 2021 Sep 30;13(10):1971. doi: 10.3390/v13101971.,"['Bai CM', 'Rosani U', 'Zhang X', 'Xin LS', 'Bortoletto E', 'Wegner KM', 'Wang CM']",True

33882257,Adenosine Deaminases Acting on RNA (ADARs) and Viral Infections.,"C6 deamination of adenosine (A) to inosine (I) in double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is catalyzed by a family of enzymes known as ADARs (adenosine deaminases acting on RNA) encoded by three genes in mammals. Alternative promoters and splicing produce two ADAR1 proteins, an interferon-inducible cytoplasmic p150 and a constitutively expressed p110 that like ADAR2 is a nuclear enzyme. ADAR3 lacks deaminase activity. A-to-I editing occurs with both viral and cellular RNAs. Deamination activity is dependent on dsRNA substrate structure and regulatory RNA-binding proteins and ranges from highly site selective with hepatitis D RNA and glutamate receptor precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) to hyperediting of measles virus and polyomavirus transcripts and cellular inverted Alu elements. Because I base-pairs as guanosine instead of A, editing can alter mRNA decoding, pre-mRNA splicing, and microRNA silencing. Editing also alters dsRNA structure, thereby suppressing innate immune responses including interferon production and action.",2021 Sep 29,Annu Rev Virol. 2021 Sep 29;8(1):239-264. doi: 10.1146/annurev-virology-091919-065320.

RNA editing, the post-transcriptional sequence alteration of RNA, has a profound effect on cell homeostasis, but its implication in the response to DNA damage was not previously explored. Here we show that, in response to DNA breaks, an overall change of the Adenosine-to-Inosine RNA editing is observed, a phenomenon we call the RNA Editing DAmage Response (REDAR). REDAR relies on the checkpoint kinase ATR and the recombination factor CtIP. Moreover, depletion of the RNA editing enzyme ADAR2 renders cells hypersensitive to genotoxic agents, increases genomic instability and hampers homologous recombination by impairing DNA resection. Such a role of ADAR2 in DNA repair goes beyond the recoding of specific transcripts, but depends on ADAR2 editing DNA:RNA hybrids to ease their dissolution.",2021 Sep 17,Nat Commun. 2021 Sep 17;12(1):5512. doi: 10.1038/s41467-021-25790-2.,"['Jimeno S', 'Prados-Carvajal R', 'Fernández-Ávila MJ', 'Silva S', 'Silvestris DA', 'Endara-Coll M', 'Rodríguez-Real G', 'Domingo-Prim J', 'Mejías-Navarro F', 'Romero-Franco A', 'Jimeno-González S', 'Barroso S', 'Cesarini V', 'Aguilera A', 'Gallo A', 'Visa N', 'Huertas P']",True
34564319,Modulation of MicroRNA Processing by Dicer via Its Associated dsRNA Binding Proteins.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that are about 22 nucleotides in length. They regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally by guiding the effector protein Argonaute to its target mRNA in a sequence-dependent manner, causing the translational repression and destabilization of the target mRNAs. Both Drosha and Dicer, members of the RNase III family proteins, are essential components in the canonical miRNA biogenesis pathway. miRNA is transcribed into primary-miRNA (pri-miRNA) from genomic DNA. Drosha then cleaves the flanking regions of pri-miRNA into precursor-miRNA (pre-miRNA), while Dicer cleaves the loop region of the pre-miRNA to form a miRNA duplex. Although the role of Drosha and Dicer in miRNA maturation is well known, the modulation processes that are important for regulating the downstream gene network are not fully understood. In this review, we summarized and discussed current reports on miRNA biogenesis caused by Drosha and Dicer.

Adar1(mZα/mZα) mice, bearing two point mutations in the Z-nucleic acid binding (Zα) domain that abolish Z-RNA binding, displayed spontaneous induction of type I interferons (IFNs) in multiple organs, including in the lung, where both stromal and hematopoietic cells showed IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) induction.

However, the mechanisms of MDA5-dependent disease pathogenesis in vivo remain unknown. Here we generated mice with a single amino acid change in ADAR1 that models the most common human ADAR AGS mutation.

A small-molecule inhibitor of the integrated stress response (ISR) that acts downstream of eIF2α phosphorylation prevented immunopathology and rescued the mice from mortality.

34397095,ADAR1 limits stress granule formation through both translation-dependent and translation-independent mechanisms.,"Stress granules (SGs) are cytoplasmic assemblies of RNA and protein that form when translation is repressed during the integrated stress response. SGs assemble from the combination of RNA-RNA, RNA-protein and protein-protein interactions between messenger ribonucleoprotein complexes (mRNPs). The protein adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1, also known as ADAR) recognizes and modifies double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) within cells to prevent an aberrant innate immune response. ADAR1 localizes to SGs, and since RNA-RNA interactions contribute to SG assembly and dsRNA induces SGs, we examined how ADAR1 affects SG formation. First, we demonstrate that ADAR1 depletion triggers SGs by allowing endogenous dsRNA to activate the integrated stress response through activation of PKR (also known as EIF2AK2) and translation repression. However, we also show that ADAR1 limits SG formation independently of translation inhibition. ADAR1 repression of SGs is independent of deaminase activity but is dependent on dsRNA-binding activity, suggesting a model where ADAR1 binding limits RNA-RNA and/or RNA-protein interactions necessary for recruitment to SGs. Given that ADAR1 expression is induced during viral infection, these findings have implications for the role of ADAR1 in the antiviral response.

34311888,"Double MS2 guided restoration of genetic code in amber (TAG), opal (TGA) and ochre (TAA) stop codon.","The popularity and promise of gene therapy for common genetic diseases are currently increasing. Although effective treatments for genetic disorders are rare, editing of the mutated gene is a possible therapeutic approach for conditions caused by stop codon mutations, including either amber (TAG), opal (TGA) or ochre (TAA) stop codons. Restoration of point-mutated RNAs using artificial RNA editing can be used to modify gene-encoded information and generate functionally distinct proteins from a single gene. By linking the catalytic domain of the RNA editing enzyme, adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR), to an antisense guide RNA, speciﬁc adenosines (A) can be converted to inosine (I), which is recognized as guanosine (G) during translation. In this study, we engineered the deaminase domain of ADAR1 and the MS2 system to target a specific adenosine and restore the G to A mutations. To this end, the ADAR1 deaminase domain was fused with the RNA binding protein, MS2, which binds to MS2 RNA. Guide RNAs of 19 bp were designed to be complementary to target mRNAs, with either 6X stem-loops downstream of the guide RNA and a CMV promoter, or a 1X MS2 stem-loop on either side of the guide RNA and a U6 promoter. The engineered ADAR1 deaminase domain could convert adenosine to inosine at the desired editing site in EGFP, which was edited to contain an amber (TAG), opal (TGA) or ochre (TAA) stop codon. The system could convert the stop codons to a read-through tryptophan codon (TGG) in a cellular system, leading to fluorescence emission, observed using JuLi microscopy. PCR-RFLP and Sanger sequencing of the target transcript were also conducted, revealing an editing efficiency of 20.97 % for the opal stop codon, and 26 % and 17 % for the 5' and 3' A residues, respectively, in the ochre stop codon, using the double MS2. This was a higher editing rate than that achieved using the MS2-6X guide RNA. Observation of restoration of the read-through codon from the three different stop codons over time demonstrated a relatively low percentage of edited codons after 24 h, which increased after 48 h, but decreased again after 72 h. Successful establishment of this system has the potential to represent a new era in the field of gene therapy.",2021 Sep,Enzyme Microb Technol. 2021 Sep;149:109851. doi: 10.1016/j.enzmictec.2021.109851.

34768866,Deciphering the Biological Significance of ADAR1-Z-RNA Interactions.,"Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) is an enzyme responsible for double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-specific adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing, which is estimated to occur at over 100 million sites in humans. ADAR1 is composed of two isoforms transcribed from different promoters: p150 and N-terminal truncated p110. Deletion of ADAR1 p150 in mice activates melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5)-sensing pathway, which recognizes endogenous unedited RNA as non-self. In contrast, we have recently demonstrated that ADAR1 p110-mediated RNA editing does not contribute to this function, implying that a unique Z-DNA/RNA-binding domain α (Zα) in the N terminus of ADAR1 p150 provides specific RNA editing, which is critical for preventing MDA5 activation. In addition, a mutation in the Zα domain is identified in patients with Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS), an inherited encephalopathy characterized by overproduction of type I interferon. Accordingly, we and other groups have recently demonstrated that Adar1 Zα-mutated mice show MDA5-dependent type I interferon responses. Furthermore, one such mutant mouse carrying a W197A point mutation in the Zα domain, which inhibits Z-RNA binding, manifests AGS-like encephalopathy.

34686350,ADAR1 restricts ZBP1-mediated immune response and PANoptosis to promote tumorigenesis.,"Cell death provides host defense and maintains homeostasis. Zα-containing molecules are essential for these processes. Z-DNA binding protein 1 (ZBP1) activates inflammatory cell death, PANoptosis, whereas adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) serves as an RNA editor to maintain homeostasis. Here, we identify and characterize ADAR1's interaction with ZBP1, defining its role in cell death regulation and tumorigenesis. Combining interferons (IFNs) and nuclear export inhibitors (NEIs) activates ZBP1-dependent PANoptosis. ADAR1 suppresses this PANoptosis by interacting with the Zα2 domain of ZBP1 to limit ZBP1 and RIPK3 interactions. Adar1(fl/fl)LysM(cre) mice are resistant to development of colorectal cancer and melanoma, but deletion of the ZBP1 Zα2 domain restores tumorigenesis in these mice. In addition, treating wild-type mice with IFN-γ and the NEI KPT-330 regresses melanoma in a ZBP1-dependent manner.

However, the extent to which RNA editing affect gene expression via modifying miRNA binding site remains unexplored. Here, we first profiled the dynamic A-to-I RNA editome across tissues of Duroc and Luchuan pigs. The RNA editing events at the miRNA binding sites were generated. The biological function of the differentially edited gene in skeletal muscle was further characterized in pig muscle-derived satellite cells. RNA editome analysis revealed a total of 171,909 A-to-I RNA editing sites (RESs), and examination of its features showed that these A-to-I editing sites were mainly located in SINE retrotransposons PRE-1/Pre0_SS element.

A-to-I RNA editing occurs predominantly in mammalian and human central nervous systems and can alter the function of translated proteins, including neurotransmitter receptors and ion channels; therefore, the role of dysregulated RNA editing in the pathogenesis of neurological diseases has been speculated. Specifically, the failure of A-to-I RNA editing at the glutamine/arginine (Q/R) site of the GluA2 subunit causes excessive permeability of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptors to Ca(2+), inducing fatal status epilepticus and the neurodegeneration of motor neurons in mice. Therefore, an RNA editing deficiency at the Q/R site in GluA2 due to the downregulation of ADAR2 in the motor neurons of sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients suggests that Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptors and the dysregulation of RNA editing are suitable therapeutic targets for ALS.

33742389,Solution NMR backbone assignments of the N-terminal Zα-linker-Zβ segment from Homo sapiens ADAR1p150.,"Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing of a subset of RNAs in a eukaryotic cell is required in order to avoid triggering the innate immune system. Editing is carried out by ADAR1, which exists as short (p110) and long (p150) isoforms. ADAR1p150 is mostly cytoplasmic, possesses a Z-RNA binding domain (Zα), and is only expressed during the innate immune response. A structurally homologous domain to Zα, the Zβ domain, is separated by a long linker from Zα on the N-terminus of ADAR1 but its function remains unknown. Zβ does not bind to RNA in isolation, yet the binding kinetics of the segment encompassing Zα, Zβ and the 95-residue linker between the two domains (Zα-Zβ) are markedly different compared to Zα alone.

34244459,Regulation and functional consequences of mGlu(4) RNA editing.,"Metabotropic glutamate receptor 4 (mGlu(4)) is one of eight mGlu receptors within the Class C G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. mGlu(4) is primarily localized to the presynaptic membrane of neurons where it functions as an auto and heteroreceptor controlling synaptic release of neurotransmitter. mGlu(4) is implicated in numerous disorders and is a promising drug target; however, more remains to be understood about its regulation and pharmacology. Using high-throughput sequencing, we have validated and quantified an adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing event that converts glutamine 124 to arginine in mGlu(4); additionally, we have identified a rare but novel K129R site. Using an in vitro editing assay, we then validated the pre-mRNA duplex that allows for editing by ADAR enzymes and predicted its conservation across the mammalian species. Structural modeling of the mGlu(4) protein predicts the Q124R substitution to occur in the B helix of the receptor that is critical for receptor dimerization and activation. Interestingly, editing of a receptor homodimer does not disrupt G protein activation in response to the endogenous agonist, glutamate. Using an assay designed to specifically measure heterodimer populations at the surface, however, we found that Q124R substitution decreased the propensity of mGlu(4) to heterodimerize with mGlu(2) and mGlu(7) Our study is the first to extensively describe the extent and regulatory factors of RNA editing of mGlu(4) mRNA transcripts. In addition, we have proposed a novel functional consequence of this editing event that provides insights regarding its effects in vivo and expands the regulatory capacity for mGlu receptors.",2021 Oct,RNA. 2021 Oct;27(10):1220-1240. doi: 10.1261/rna.078729.121.

34426254,A concise review on the role of BDNF-AS in human disorders.,"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor-antisense (BDNF-AS) is a long non-coding RNA with tens of alternatively spliced variants being transcribed from 11p14 cytogenetic band. As a naturally occurring anti-sense, it regulates expression of BDNF, a factor which as essential roles in the pathoetiology of neurodevelopmental diseases. Notably, BDNF-AS has been reported to be down-regulated in colorectal cancer, osteosarcoma, esophageal cancer, glioblastoma, prostate cancer, cervical cancer and breast cancer. This lncRNA has direct/indirect functional interactions with GSK-3β, EZH2, miR-214, PABPC1, RAX2, DLG5, p53 and ADAR as well as RNH1/TRIM21/mTOR signaling. In prostate and breast cancers, down-regulation of BDNF-AS has been associated with poor clinical outcome. In the present review, we assessed the existing literature on the role of BDNF-AS in this process and summarized the available data in three distinct sections based of the methodology of experiments and source of expression assays.

The 5-HT(2C) R is the only G-protein-coupled receptor known to undergo post-transcriptional adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) editing by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR). 5-HT(2C) R has emerged as an important role in the modulation of pancreatic β cell functions. This study investigated mechanisms behind the effects of palmitic acid (PA) on insulin secretion in different overexpressed 5-HT(2C) R edited isoforms in pancreatic MIN6 β cells. Results showed that the expressions of 5HT(2C) R and ADAR2 were upregulated in the pancreatic islets of mice fed with high-fat diet (HFD) compared to control mice. PA treatment significantly induced the expressions of 5-HT(2C) R and ADAR2 in pancreatic MIN6 β cells. PA treatment significantly induced the editing of 5-HT(2C) R in pancreatic MIN6 β cells. There was no significant difference in cell viability between naïve cells and three overexpressed 5-HT(2C) R edited isoforms in pancreatic MIN6 β cells. Overexpressed 5-HT(2C) R edited isoforms showed reduced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) compared with green fluorescent protein (GFP) expressed cells. Moreover, 5-HT(2C) R edited isoforms displayed reduced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium release and store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) activation, probably through inhibition of stromal interaction molecule 1 trafficking under PA treatment. Altogether, our results show that PA-mediated editing of 5-HT(2C) R modulates GSIS through alteration of ER calcium release and SOCE activation in pancreatic MIN6 β cells.",2021 Oct,FASEB J. 2021 Oct;35(10):e21929. doi: 10.1096/fj.202100265RR.,"['Xie KY', 'Chien SJ', 'Tan BC', 'Chen YW']",True
34665969,Arabidopsis thaliana endonuclease V is a ribonuclease specific for inosine-containing single-stranded RNA.,"Endonuclease V is highly conserved, both structurally and functionally, from bacteria to humans, and it cleaves the deoxyinosine-containing double-stranded DNA in Escherichia coli, whereas in Homo sapiens it catalyses the inosine-containing single-stranded RNA. Thus, deoxyinosine and inosine are unexpectedly produced by the deamination reactions of adenine in DNA and RNA, respectively. Moreover, adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing is carried out by adenosine deaminase acting on dsRNA (ADARs). We focused on Arabidopsis thaliana endonuclease V (AtEndoV) activity exhibiting variations in DNA or RNA substrate specificities. Since no ADAR was observed for A-to-I editing in A. thaliana, the possibility of inosine generation by A-to-I editing can be ruled out. Purified AtEndoV protein cleaved the second and third phosphodiester bonds, 3' to inosine in single-strand RNA, at a low reaction temperature of 20-25°C, whereas the AtEndoV (Y100A) protein bearing a mutation in substrate recognition sites did not cleave these bonds. Furthermore, AtEndoV, similar to human EndoV, prefers RNA substrates over DNA substrates, and it could not cleave the inosine-containing double-stranded RNA. Thus, we propose the possibility that AtEndoV functions as an RNA substrate containing inosine induced by RNA damage, and not by A-to-I RNA editing in vivo.",2021 Oct,Open Biol. 2021 Oct;11(10):210148. doi: 10.1098/rsob.210148.

Moreover, alcohol misuse usually leads to several diseases and conditions, including alcoholism, which is a chronic condition and a form of addiction. Alcohol misuse, whether as acute intoxication or alcoholism, adversely affects skeletal, cardiac and/or smooth muscle contraction. Ethanol (ethyl alcohol) is the main effector of alcohol-induced dysregulation of muscle contractility, regardless of alcoholic beverage type or the ethanol metabolite (with acetaldehyde being a notable exception). Ethanol, however, is a simple and ""promiscuous"" ligand that affects many targets to mediate a single biological effect. In this review, we firstly summarize the processes of excitation-contraction coupling and calcium homeostasis which are critical for the regulation of contractility in all muscle types. Secondly, we present the effects of acute and chronic alcohol exposure on the contractility of skeletal, cardiac, and vascular/ nonvascular smooth muscles. Distinctions are made between in vivo and in vitro experiments, intoxicating vs. sub-intoxicating ethanol levels, and human subjects vs. animal models. The differential effects of alcohol on biological sexes are also examined. Lastly, we show that alcohol-mediated disruption of muscle contractility, involves a wide variety of molecular players, including contractile proteins, their regulatory factors, membrane ion channels and pumps, and several signaling molecules. Clear identification of these molecular players constitutes a first step for a rationale design of pharmacotherapeutics to prevent, ameliorate and/or reverse the negative effects of alcohol on muscle contractility.",2021 Oct,Adv Drug Alcohol Res. 2021 Oct;1:10011. doi: 10.3389/ADAR.2021.10011.

34694399,ADAR Editing in Viruses: An Evolutionary Force to Reckon with.,"Adenosine Deaminases that Act on RNA (ADARs) are RNA editing enzymes that play a dynamic and nuanced role in regulating transcriptome and proteome diversity. This editing can be highly selective, affecting a specific site within a transcript, or nonselective, resulting in hyperediting. ADAR editing is important for regulating neural functions and autoimmunity, and has a key role in the innate immune response to viral infections, where editing can have a range of pro- or antiviral effects and can contribute to viral evolution. Here we examine the role of ADAR editing across a broad range of viral groups. We propose that the effect of ADAR editing on viral replication, whether pro- or antiviral, is better viewed as an axis rather than a binary, and that the specific position of a given virus on this axis is highly dependent on virus- and host-specific factors, and can change over the course of infection. However, more research needs to be devoted to understanding these dynamic factors and how they affect virus-ADAR interactions and viral evolution. Another area that warrants significant attention is the effect of virus-ADAR interactions on host-ADAR interactions, particularly in light of the crucial role of ADAR in regulating neural functions. Answering these questions will be essential to developing our understanding of the relationship between ADAR editing and viral infection. In turn, this will further our understanding of the effects of viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, as well as many others, and thereby influence our approach to treating these deadly diseases.",2021 Nov 5,Genome Biol Evol. 2021 Nov 5;13(11):evab240. doi: 10.1093/gbe/evab240.,"['Piontkivska H', 'Wales-McGrath B', 'Miyamoto M', 'Wayne ML']",False

However, no available RNA editing inhibitors have so far been developed to inhibit cancer-associated RNA editing events. Here, we decipher the RNA secondary structure of antizyme inhibitor 1 (AZIN1), one of the best-studied A-to-I editing targets in cancer, by locating its editing site complementary sequence (ECS) at the 3' end of exon 12. Chemically modified antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) that target the editing region of AZIN1 caused a substantial exon 11 skipping, whereas ECS-targeting ASOs effectively abolished AZIN1 editing without affecting splicing and translation. We demonstrate that complete 2'-O-methyl (2'-O-Me) sugar ring modification in combination with partial phosphorothioate (PS) backbone modification may be an optimal chemistry for editing inhibition. ASO3.2, which targets the ECS, specifically inhibits cancer cell viability in vitro and tumor incidence and growth in xenograft models.

34827627,Comprehensive Atlas of the Myelin Basic Protein Interaction Landscape.,"Intrinsically disordered myelin basic protein (MBP) is one of the key autoantigens in autoimmune neurodegeneration and multiple sclerosis particularly. MBP is highly positively charged and lacks distinct structure in solution and therefore its intracellular partners are still mostly enigmatic. Here we used combination of formaldehyde-induced cross-linking followed by immunoprecipitation and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to elucidate the interaction network of MBP in mammalian cells and provide the list of potential MBP interacting proteins. Our data suggest that the largest group of MBP-interacting proteins belongs to cellular proteins involved in the protein translation machinery, as well as in the spatial and temporal regulation of translation. MBP interacts with core ribosomal proteins, RNA helicase Ddx28 and RNA-binding proteins STAU1, TDP-43, ADAR-1 and hnRNP A0, which are involved in various stages of RNA biogenesis and processing, including specific maintaining MBP-coding mRNA. Among MBP partners we identified CTNND1, which has previously been shown to be necessary for myelinating Schwann cells for cell-cell interactions and the formation of a normal myelin sheath. MBP binds proteins MAGEB2/D2 associated with neurotrophin receptor p75NTR, involved in pathways that promote neuronal survival and neuronal death. Finally, we observed that MBP interacts with RNF40-a component of heterotetrameric Rnf40/Rnf20 E3 ligase complex, recruited by Egr2, which is the central transcriptional regulator of peripheral myelination. Concluding, our data suggest that MBP may be more actively involved in myelination not only as a main building block but also as a self-regulating element.",2021 Nov 3,Biomolecules. 2021 Nov 3;11(11):1628. doi: 10.3390/biom11111628.,"['Smirnova EV', 'Rakitina TV', 'Ziganshin RH', 'Arapidi GP', 'Saratov GA', 'Kudriaeva AA', 'Belogurov AA']",False

The robust inter-dependence of parameters in the global fitting process using multi-magnetic field CPMG profiles allows us characterizing the dynamic properties of conformational changes in hZα(ADAR1).

A recent study has demonstrated that ADAR1 affects BDNF expression via miR-432 and is involved in antidepressant action. However, the detailed molecular mechanism is still unclear. We have uncovered a new molecular mechanism showing the involvement of miR-432 and circ_0000418 in mediating the antidepressant action of ADAR1. We demonstrate that the ADAR1 inducer (IFN-γ) alleviates the depressive-like behaviors of BALB/c mice treated with chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) exposure. Moreover, both in vivo and in vitro studies show that ADAR1 differently impacts miR-432 and circ_0000418 expressions.

Several studies have reported that ADAR1 is closely associated with numerous malignancies. However, the functional roles of ADAR1 in prostate cancer (PCa) have not been fully elucidated. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the effects of ADAR1 on PCa. The results demonstrated that ADAR1 was highly expressed in PCa tissues compared with normal tissues. Furthermore, the protein expression level of ADAR1 was significantly increased in castration-resistant PCa (CRPCa) tissues and CRPCa cell lines. Thus, these findings indicated that ADAR1 may act as a tumor promoter for PCa development. Next, the potential effects of ADAR1-knockdown on the proliferation of DU145 and PC3 cells were investigated. ADAR1 was knocked down via small interfering RNA transfection, which was found to exert antitumor effects on DU145 and PC3 cells at 24 and 48 h post transfection. Furthermore, a significant positive association was observed between ADAR1-knockdown and the apoptosis of DU145 and PC3 cells, which increased the phosphorylation of H2A.X variant histone.

33593231,The effects of RNA editing in cancer tissue at different stages in carcinogenesis.,"RNA editing is one of the most prevalent and abundant forms of post-transcriptional RNA modification observed in normal physiological processes and often aberrant in diseases including cancer. RNA editing changes the sequences of mRNAs, making them different from the source DNA sequence. Edited mRNAs can produce editing-recoded protein isoforms that are functionally different from the corresponding genome-encoded protein isoforms. The major type of RNA editing in mammals occurs by enzymatic deamination of adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) within double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) or hairpins in pre-mRNA transcripts. Enzymes that catalyse these processes belong to the adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) family. The vast majority of knowledge on the RNA editing landscape relevant to human disease has been acquired using in vitro cancer cell culture models. The limitation of such in vitro models, however, is that the physiological or disease relevance of results obtained is not necessarily obvious. In this review we focus on discussing in vivo occurring RNA editing events that have been identified in human cancer tissue using samples surgically resected or clinically retrieved from patients.

However, the mechanisms involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of the expression of disease-associated lncRNAs are not fully understood. Gene expression studies revealed that Nuclear Paraspeckle Assembly Transcript 1 (NEAT1) lncRNA expression was increased by >2-fold in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) derived from patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) or in carotid artery atherosclerotic plaques. We observed a linear association between NEAT1 lncRNA expression and prevalence of CAD which was independent of age, sex, cardiovascular traditional risk factors and renal function. NEAT1 expression was induced by TNF-α, while silencing of NEAT1 profoundly attenuated the TNF-α-induced vascular endothelial cell pro-inflammatory response as defined by the expression of CXCL8, CCL2, VCAM1 and ICAM1. Overexpression of the RNA editing enzyme adenosine deaminase acting on RNA-1 (ADAR1), but not of its editing-deficient mutant, upregulated NEAT1 levels. Conversely, silencing of ADAR1 suppressed the basal levels and the TNF-α-induced increase of NEAT1. NEAT1 lncRNA expression was strongly associated with ADAR1 in CAD and peripheral arterial vascular disease. RNA editing mapping studies revealed the presence of several inosines in close proximity to AU-rich elements within the AluSx3(+)/AluJo(-) double-stranded RNA complex.

For example, A-to-I editing of microRNAs through adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) enzymes can affect their expression levels and functional roles, but editing isoform-specific assays are not commercially available. Here, we describe RT-qPCR assays that are specific for editing isoforms, using microRNA-379 (miR-379) as a model. The assays are based on two-tailed RT-qPCR, and we show them to be compatible both with SYBR Green and hydrolysis-based chemistries, as well as with both qPCR and digital PCR. The assays could readily detect different miR-379 editing isoforms in various human tissues as well as changes of editing levels in ADAR-overexpressing cell lines. We found that the miR-379 editing frequency was higher in prostate cancer samples compared to benign prostatic hyperplasia samples. Furthermore, decreased expression of unedited miR-379, but not edited miR-379, was associated with treatment resistance, metastasis, and shorter overall survival.

Virtual docking and molecular dynamics simulation approaches were used to screen the potential activity of 2115 FDA-approved compounds on the Zα domain of ADAR1 and filtered for to obtain the top-scoring hits. The top three compounds with the best XP Gscore-namely alendronate (-7.045), etidronate (-6.923), and zoledronate (-6.77)-were subjected to 50 ns simulations to characterize complex stability and identify the fundamental interactions that contribute to inhibition of the ADAR1 Zα domain. The three compounds were shown to interact with Lys169, Lys170, Asn173, and Tyr177 of the Zα domain-like helical backbone of Z-RNA.

The SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence data of many infected patients have been largely curated in a number of publicly available databases, including the corresponding epidemiological data made available by the Victorian Department of Health and Human Services. We have critically analysed the available SARS-CoV-2 haplotypes and genomic sequences in the context of putative deficits in innate immune APOBEC and ADAR deaminase anti-viral responses. It is now known that immune impaired elderly co-morbid patients display clear deficits in interferon type 1 (α/β) and III (λ) stimulated innate immune gene cascades, of which APOBEC and ADAR induced expression are part. These deficiencies may help explain some of the clear genetic patterns in SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated in Victoria, Australia, during the 2nd Wave (June-September, 2020). We tested the hypothesis that predicted lowered innate immune APOBEC and ADAR anti-viral deaminase responses in a significant proportion of elderly patients would be consistent with/reflected in a low level of observed mutagenesis in many isolated SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Our findings are consistent with this expectation. The analysis also supports the conclusions of the Victorian government's Department of Health that essentially one variant or haplotype infected Victorian aged care facilities where the great majority (79%) of all 820 SARS-CoV-2 associated deaths occurred.

35586115,8-azaadenosine and 8-chloroadenosine are not selective inhibitors of ADAR.,"The RNA editing enzyme ADAR, is an attractive therapeutic target for multiple cancers. Through its deaminase activity, ADAR edits adenosine to inosine in dsRNAs. Loss of ADAR in some cancer cell lines causes activation of the type I interferon pathway and the PKR translational repressor, leading to inhibition of proliferation and stimulation of cell death. As such, inhibition of ADAR function is a viable therapeutic strategy for many cancers. However, there are no FDA approved inhibitors of ADAR. Two small molecules have been previously shown to inhibit ADAR or reduce its expression: 8-azaadenosine and 8-chloroadenosine. Here we show that neither molecule is a selective inhibitor of ADAR. Both 8-azaadenosine and 8-chloroadenosine show similar toxicity to ADAR-dependent and independent cancer cell lines. Furthermore, the toxicity of both small molecules is comparable between cell lines with either knockdown or overexpression of ADAR, and cells with unperturbed ADAR expression. Treatment with neither molecule causes activation of PKR. Finally, treatment with either molecule has no effect on A-to-I editing of multiple ADAR substrates. Together these data show that 8-azaadenosine and 8-chloroadenosine are not suitable small molecules for therapies that require selective inhibition of ADAR, and neither should be used in preclinical studies as ADAR inhibitors.",2021 Nov,Cancer Res Commun. 2021 Nov;1(2):56-64. doi: 10.1158/2767-9764.crc-21-0027.,"['Cottrell KA', 'Torres LS', 'Dizon MG', 'Weber JD']",False

The study of RNA editing is limited by the absence of editing maps for most model organisms, hindering the understanding of its impact on various physiological conditions. Here, we mapped the vertebrate developmental landscape of A-to-I RNA editing, and generated the first comprehensive atlas of editing sites in zebrafish. Tens of thousands unique editing events and 149 coding sites were identified with high-accuracy. Some of these edited sites are conserved between zebrafish and humans. Sequence analysis of RNA over seven developmental stages revealed high levels of editing activity in early stages of embryogenesis, when embryos rely on maternal mRNAs and proteins. In contrast to the other organisms studied so far, the highest levels of editing were detected in the zebrafish ovary and testes. This resource can serve as the basis for understanding of the role of editing during zebrafish development and maturity.",2021 May 7,Nucleic Acids Res. 2021 May 7;49(8):4325-4337. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkab247.,"['Buchumenski I', 'Holler K', 'Appelbaum L', 'Eisenberg E', 'Junker JP', 'Levanon EY']",True
34037233,Enrichment of Zα domains at cytoplasmic stress granules is due to their innate ability to bind to nucleic acids.,"Zα domains recognize the left-handed helical Z conformation of double-stranded nucleic acids. They are found in proteins involved in the nucleic acid sensory pathway of the vertebrate innate immune system and host evasion by viral pathogens. Previously, it has been demonstrated that ADAR1 (encoded by ADAR in humans) and DAI (also known as ZBP1) localize to cytoplasmic stress granules (SGs), and this localization is mediated by their Zα domains. To investigate the mechanism, we determined the interactions and localization pattern for the N-terminal region of human DAI (ZαβDAI), which harbours two Zα domains, and for a ZαβDAI mutant deficient in nucleic acid binding. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated the ability of ZαβDAI to bind to hyperedited nucleic acids, which are enriched in SGs. Furthermore, using immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation coupled with mass spectrometry, we identified several interacting partners of the ZαβDAI-RNA complex in vivo under conditions of arsenite-induced stress. These interactions are lost upon loss of nucleic acid-binding ability or upon RNase treatment. Thus, we posit that the mechanism for the translocation of Zα domain-containing proteins to SGs is mainly mediated by the nucleic acid-binding ability of their Zα domains.

34068948,From Antisense RNA to RNA Modification: Therapeutic Potential of RNA-Based Technologies.,"Therapeutic oligonucleotides interact with a target RNA via Watson-Crick complementarity, affecting RNA-processing reactions such as mRNA degradation, pre-mRNA splicing, or mRNA translation. Since they were proposed decades ago, several have been approved for clinical use to correct genetic mutations. Three types of mechanisms of action (MoA) have emerged: RNase H-dependent degradation of mRNA directed by short chimeric antisense oligonucleotides (gapmers), correction of splicing defects via splice-modulation oligonucleotides, and interference of gene expression via short interfering RNAs (siRNAs). These antisense-based mechanisms can tackle several genetic disorders in a gene-specific manner, primarily by gene downregulation (gapmers and siRNAs) or splicing defects correction (exon-skipping oligos). Still, the challenge remains for the repair at the single-nucleotide level. The emerging field of epitranscriptomics and RNA modifications shows the enormous possibilities for recoding the transcriptome and repairing genetic mutations with high specificity while harnessing endogenously expressed RNA processing machinery. Some of these techniques have been proposed as alternatives to CRISPR-based technologies, where the exogenous gene-editing machinery needs to be delivered and expressed in the human cells to generate permanent (DNA) changes with unknown consequences. Here, we review the current FDA-approved antisense MoA (emphasizing some enabling technologies that contributed to their success) and three novel modalities based on post-transcriptional RNA modifications with therapeutic potential, including ADAR (Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA)-mediated RNA editing, targeted pseudouridylation, and 2'-O-methylation.",2021 May 14,Biomedicines. 2021 May 14;9(5):550. doi: 10.3390/biomedicines9050550.,"['Adachi H', 'Hengesbach M', 'Yu YT', 'Morais P']",False
33939417,Rational Design of RNA Editing Guide Strands: Cytidine Analogs at the Orphan Position.,"Adenosine Deaminases Acting on RNA (ADARs) convert adenosine to inosine in double stranded RNA. Human ADARs can be directed to predetermined target sites in the transcriptome by complementary guide strands, allowing for the correction of disease-causing mutations at the RNA level. Here we use structural information available for ADAR2-RNA complexes to guide the design of nucleoside analogs for the position in the guide strand that contacts a conserved glutamic acid residue in ADARs (E488 in human ADAR2), which flips the adenosine into the ADAR active site for deamination. Mutating this residue to glutamine (E488Q) results in higher activity because of the hydrogen bond donating ability of Q488 to N3 of the orphan cytidine on the guide strand. We describe the evaluation of cytidine analogs for this position that stabilize an activated conformation of the enzyme-RNA complex and increase catalytic rate for deamination by the wild-type enzyme. A new crystal structure of ADAR2 bound to duplex RNA bearing a cytidine analog revealed a close contact between E488, stabilized by an additional hydrogen bond and altered charge distribution when compared to cytidine. In human cells and mouse primary liver fibroblasts, this single nucleotide modification increased directed editing yields when compared to an otherwise identical guide oligonucleotide. Our results show that modification of the guide RNA can mimic the effect of hyperactive mutants and advance the approach of recruiting endogenous ADARs for site-directed RNA editing.",2021 May 12,J Am Chem Soc. 2021 May 12;143(18):6865-6876. doi: 10.1021/jacs.0c13319.

33983932,RNA editing at a limited number of sites is sufficient to prevent MDA5 activation in the mouse brain.,"Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1), an enzyme responsible for adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing, is composed of two isoforms: nuclear p110 and cytoplasmic p150. Deletion of Adar1 or Adar1 p150 genes in mice results in embryonic lethality with overexpression of interferon-stimulating genes (ISGs), caused by the aberrant recognition of unedited endogenous transcripts by melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5). However, among numerous RNA editing sites, how many RNA sites require editing, especially by ADAR1 p150, to avoid MDA5 activation and whether ADAR1 p110 contributes to this function remains elusive. In particular, ADAR1 p110 is abundant in the mouse brain where a subtle amount of ADAR1 p150 is expressed, whereas ADAR1 mutations cause Aicardi-Goutières syndrome, in which the brain is one of the most affected organs accompanied by the elevated expression of ISGs. Therefore, understanding RNA editing-mediated prevention of MDA5 activation in the brain is especially important. Here, we established Adar1 p110-specific knockout mice, in which the upregulated expression of ISGs was not observed. This result suggests that ADAR1 p150-mediated RNA editing is enough to suppress MDA5 activation. Therefore, we further created Adar1 p110/Adar2 double knockout mice to identify ADAR1 p150-mediated editing sites. This analysis demonstrated that although the elevated expression of ISGs was not observed, only less than 2% of editing sites were preserved in the brains of Adar1 p110/Adar2 double knockout mice. Of note, we found that some sites were highly edited, which was comparable to those found in wild-type mice, indicating the presence of ADAR1 p150-specific sites. These data suggest that RNA editing at a very limited sites, which is mediated by a subtle amount of ADAR1 p150, is sufficient to prevents MDA5 activation, at least in the mouse brain.",2021 May,PLoS Genet. 2021 May 13;17(5):e1009516. doi: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1009516. eCollection 2021 May.,"['Kim JI', 'Nakahama T', 'Yamasaki R', 'Costa Cruz PH', 'Vongpipatana T', 'Inoue M', 'Kanou N', 'Xing Y', 'Todo H', 'Shibuya T', 'Kato Y', 'Kawahara Y']",True
33639276,The role of A-to-I RNA editing in infections by RNA viruses: Possible implications for SARS-CoV-2 infection.,"RNA editing is a fundamental biological process with 2 major forms, namely adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I, recognized as A-to-G) and cytosine-to-uracil (C-to-U) deamination, mediated by ADAR and APOBEC enzyme families, respectively. A-to-I RNA editing has been shown to directly affect the genome/transcriptome of RNA viruses with significant repercussions for viral protein synthesis, proliferation and infectivity, while it also affects recognition of double-stranded RNAs by cytosolic receptors controlling the host innate immune response. Recent evidence suggests that RNA editing may be present in SARS-CoV-2 genome/transcriptome. The majority of mapped mutations in SARS-CoV-2 genome are A-to-G/U-to-C(opposite strand) and C-to-U/G-to-A(opposite strand) substitutions comprising potential ADAR-/APOBEC-mediated deamination events. A single nucleotide substitution can have dramatic effects on SARS-CoV-2 infectivity as shown by the D614G(A-to-G) substitution in the spike protein. Future studies utilizing serial sampling from patients with COVID-19 are warranted to delineate whether RNA editing affects viral replication and/or the host immune response to SARS-CoV-2.",2021 May,Clin Immunol. 2021 May;226:108699. doi: 10.1016/j.clim.2021.108699.

33983939,"To ""Z"" or not to ""Z"": Z-RNA, self-recognition, and the MDA5 helicase.","Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is produced both by virus and host. Its recognition by the melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) initiates type I interferon responses. How can a host distinguish self-transcripts from nonself to ensure that responses are targeted correctly? Here, I discuss a role for MDA5 helicase in inducing Z-RNA formation by Alu inverted repeat (AIR) elements. These retroelements have highly conserved sequences that favor Z-formation, creating a site for the dsRNA-specific deaminase enzyme ADAR1 to dock. The subsequent editing destabilizes the dsRNA, ending further interaction with MDA5 and terminating innate immune responses directed against self. By enabling self-recognition, Alu retrotransposons, once invaders, now are genetic elements that keep immune responses in check. I also discuss the possible but less characterized roles of the other helicases in modulating innate immune responses, focusing on DExH-box helicase 9 (DHX9) and Mov10 RISC complex RNA helicase (MOV10). DHX9 and MOV10 function differently from MDA5, but still use nucleic acid structure, rather than nucleotide sequence, to define self. Those genetic elements encoding the alternative conformations involved, referred to as flipons, enable helicases to dynamically shape a cell's repertoire of responses. In the case of MDA5, Alu flipons switch off the dsRNA-dependent responses against self. I suggest a number of genetic systems in which to study interactions between flipons and helicases further.",2021 May,PLoS Genet. 2021 May 13;17(5):e1009513. doi: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1009513. eCollection 2021 May.,['Herbert A'],True

The contribution of the RNA silencing machinery remains to be established, but several recent studies indicate that the ribonuclease DICER can generate viral siRNAs in specific conditions. It has also been proposed that type I IFN and RNA silencing could be mutually exclusive antiviral responses. In order to decipher the implication of DICER during infection of human cells with alphaviruses such as the Sindbis virus and Semliki forest virus, we determined its interactome by proteomics analysis. We show that DICER specifically interacts with several double-stranded RNA binding proteins and RNA helicases during viral infection. In particular, proteins such as DHX9, ADAR-1 and the protein kinase RNA-activated (PKR) are enriched with DICER in virus-infected cells.

Nevertheless, the biological effects and underlying mechanisms of circRNAs in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remain unclear. METHODS: Differentially expressed circRNAs between cancerous tissue and adjacent normal tissues were identified by RNA sequencing in PDAC. Subsequently, in vitro and in vivo functional experiments were performed to investigate the functional roles of circNEIL3 in PDAC tumour growth and metastasis. Furthermore, RNA pull-down, dual-luciferase reporter assays, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and Sanger sequencing assays were performed to examine the circular interaction among circNEIL3, miR-432-5p and adenosine deaminases acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1). RESULTS: CircNEIL3 was upregulated in PDAC and promoted the progression of PDAC cells both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, circNEIL3 was shown to regulate the expression of ADAR1 by sponging miR-432-5p to induce RNA editing of glioma-associated oncogene 1 (GLI1), ultimately influencing cell cycle progression and promoting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in PDAC cells. Moreover, we discovered that the circNEIL3/miR-432-5p/ADAR1 axis was correlated with the PDAC clinical stage and overall survival of PDAC patients, while ADAR1 may reduce the biogenesis of circNEIL3. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal that circNEIL3 facilitates the proliferation and metastasis of PDAC through the circNEIL3/miR-432-5p/ADAR1/GLI1/cell cycle and EMT axis and that its expression is regulated by ADAR1 through a negative feedback loop. Therefore, circNEIL3 may serve as a prognostic marker and a therapeutic target for PDAC.",2021 Mar 9,Mol Cancer. 2021 Mar 9;20(1):51. doi: 10.1186/s12943-021-01333-7.,"['Shen P', 'Yang T', 'Chen Q', 'Yuan H', 'Wu P', 'Cai B', 'Meng L', 'Huang X', 'Liu J', 'Zhang Y', 'Hu W', 'Miao Y', 'Lu Z', 'Jiang K']",True

Genetic variation contributes to RNA editing variability between individuals and has the potential to impact phenotypic variability. RESULTS: We analyze matched genetic and transcriptomic data in 49 tissues across 437 individuals to identify RNA editing events that are associated with genetic variation. Using an RNA editing quantitative trait loci (edQTL) mapping approach, we identify 3117 unique RNA editing events associated with a cis genetic polymorphism. Fourteen percent of these edQTL events are also associated with genetic variation in their gene expression. A subset of these events are associated with genome-wide association study signals of complex traits or diseases. We determine that tissue-specific levels of ADAR and ADARB1 are able to explain a subset of tissue-specific edQTL events. We find that certain microRNAs are able to differentiate between the edited and unedited isoforms of their targets. Furthermore, microRNAs can generate an expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) signal from an edQTL locus by microRNA-mediated transcript degradation in an editing-specific manner. By integrative analyses of edQTL, eQTL, and microRNA expression profiles, we computationally discover and experimentally validate edQTL-microRNA pairs for which the microRNA may generate an eQTL signal from an edQTL locus in a tissue-specific manner.

33279720,ADAR1 Stimulation by IFN-α Downregulates the Expression of MAVS via RNA Editing to Regulate the Anti-HBV Response.,"The partial response of chronic hepatitis B virus (CHB) patients to interferon-α (IFN-α) therapy remains elusive, which requires a better understanding of the involved molecular mechanism. In our study, bioinformatics analysis was applied to relate IFN-α regulated candidate genes and RNA editing sites by RNA sequencing. Mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) antiviral effect was confirmed in HepG2.2.15 cells and in two mouse models. The associations between polymorphisms in MAVS gene and response to IFN-α therapy were confirmed in CHB patients. We found that IFN-α downregulates MAVS via RNA editing that was mediated by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR1). ADAR1 inhibited MAVS expression via a human antigen R (HuR)-mediated post-transcriptional regulation. MAVS exerted an antiviral activity and reduced the level of hepatitis B virus (HBV) markers in vitro and in vivo. IFN-α antiviral effects were significantly enhanced by MAVS co-transfection. Hepatitis B core protein (HBc) interacted with SP1 to inhibit the promoter activity of MAVS that regulates its expression. CHB patients with a rs3746662A allele had higher MAVS expression and thus were more responsive to IFN-α treatment. In this work, we demonstrated that the decrease of MAVS expression is mediated by the IFN-α-ADAR1 axis.

To elucidate the dynamics and mechanism of protein binding, parameters implementing CPMG relaxation dispersion results must be appropriately determined. Building an analytical model for multi-state transitions is particularly complex. In this study, we developed a new global search algorithm that incorporates a random search approach combined with a field-dependent global parameterization method. The robust inter-dependence of the parameters carrying out the global search for individual residues (GSIR) or the global search for total residues (GSTR) provides information on the global minimum of the conformational transition process of the Zα domain of human ADAR1 (hZα(ADAR1))-DNA complex. The global search results indicated that a α-helical segment of hZα(ADAR1) provided the main contribution to the three-state conformational changes of a hZα(ADAR1)-DNA complex with a slow B-Z exchange process. The two global exchange rate constants, k(ex) and k(ZB), were found to be 844 and 9.8 s(-1), respectively, in agreement with two regimes of residue-dependent chemical shift differences-the ""dominant oscillatory regime"" and ""semi-oscillatory regime"".

Recent studies have found adenosine deaminase acting on RNA1 (ADAR1) is a novel target being sensitive to stress at epigenetic level. The epigenetic regulation mechanism of stress-related depression is still unclear so far. To explore the potential regulating mechanism of ADAR1 on BDNF, over and low expression of ADAR1 in PC12 and SH-SY5Y cell lines are prepared. In the meanwhile, chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) mice are treated with ADAR1 inducer (interferon-γ, IFN-γ). ADAR1 regulates BDNF expression, which is proven by that over and low expressions of ADAR1 increase and decrease BDNF mRNA and protein respectively in vitro. Additionally, ADAR1 inducer alleviates the depressive-like behavior of CUS mice by recovering the decreased BDNF protein in brain and serum. Moreover, over and low expressions of ADAR1 reduce and enhance microRNA-432 (miR-432) expression respectively in vitro. Furtherly, over and low miR-432 expressions lead to decreased and increased BDNF and ADAR1 mRNA, protein and immunoreactivity respectively in vitro. The above results demonstrate that ADAR1 is involved in antidepressant action by regulating BDNF via miR-432.

33723056,Decoupling expression and editing preferences of ADAR1 p150 and p110 isoforms.,"Human adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) catalyzes adenosine-to-inosine deamination reactions on double-stranded RNA molecules to regulate cellular responses to endogenous and exogenous RNA. Defective ADAR1 editing leads to disorders such as Aicardi-Goutières syndrome, an autoinflammatory disease that manifests in the brain and skin, and dyschromatosis symmetrica hereditaria, a skin pigmentation disorder. Two ADAR1 protein isoforms, p150 (150 kDa) and p110 (110 kDa), are expressed and can edit RNA, but the contribution of each isoform to the editing landscape remains unclear, largely because of the challenges in expressing p150 without p110. In this study, we demonstrate that p110 is coexpressed with p150 from the canonical p150-encoding mRNA due to leaky ribosome scanning downstream of the p150 start codon. The presence of a strong Kozak consensus context surrounding the p110 start codon suggests the p150 mRNA is optimized to leak p110 alongside expression of p150. To reduce leaky scanning and translation initiation at the p110 start codon, we introduced synonymous mutations in the coding region between the p150 and p110 start codons. Cells expressing p150 constructs with these mutations produced significantly reduced levels of p110. Editing analysis of total RNA from ADAR1 knockout cells reconstituted separately with modified p150 and p110 revealed that more than half of the A-to-I edit sites are selectively edited by p150, and the other half are edited by either p150 or p110.

The cytoplasmic ADAR1p150 edits 3'UTR double-stranded RNAs and thereby suppresses induction of interferons. Loss of this ADAR1p150 function underlies the embryonic lethality of Adar1 null mice, pathogenesis of the severe autoimmune disease Aicardi-Goutières syndrome, and the resistance developed in cancers to immune checkpoint blockade. In contrast, the biological functions of the nuclear-localized ADAR1p110 remain largely unknown. Here, we report that ADAR1p110 regulates R-loop formation and genome stability at telomeres in cancer cells carrying non-canonical variants of telomeric repeats. ADAR1p110 edits the A-C mismatches within RNA:DNA hybrids formed between canonical and non-canonical variant repeats. Editing of A-C mismatches to I:C matched pairs facilitates resolution of telomeric R-loops by RNase H2. This ADAR1p110-dependent control of telomeric R-loops is required for continued proliferation of telomerase-reactivated cancer cells, revealing the pro-oncogenic nature of ADAR1p110 and identifying ADAR1 as a promising therapeutic target of telomerase positive cancers.",2021 Mar 12,Nat Commun. 2021 Mar 12;12(1):1654. doi: 10.1038/s41467-021-21921-x.,"['Shiromoto Y', 'Sakurai M', 'Minakuchi M', 'Ariyoshi K', 'Nishikura K']",True
33383047,Immune-related IncRNA LINC00944 responds to variations in ADAR1 levels and it is associated with breast cancer prognosis.,"AIMS: Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of woman deaths worldwide, being a major public health problem. It has been reported that the expression of the RNA-editing enzyme Adenosine Deaminase Acting on RNAs 1 (ADAR1) is upregulated in breast cancer, predicting poor prognosis in patients. A few reports in literature examine ADAR1 and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) interplay in cancer and suggest key roles in cancer-related pathways. This study aimed to investigate whether ADAR1 could alter the expression levels of lncRNAs and explore how those changes are related to breast cancer biology. MAIN METHODS: ADAR1 overexpression and knockdown studies were performed in breast cancer cell lines to analyze the effects over lncRNAs expression. Guilt-by-Association correlation analysis of the TCGA-BRCA cohort was performed to predict the function of the lncRNA LINC00944. KEY FINDINGS: Here, we show that LINC00944 is responsive to ADAR1 up- and downregulation in breast cancer cells. We found that LINC00944 expression has a strong relationship with immune signaling pathways. Further assessment of the TCGA-BRCA cohort showed that LINC00944 expression was positively correlated to tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes and pro-apoptotic markers. Moreover, we found that LINC00944 expression was correlated to the age at diagnosis, tumor size, and estrogen and progesterone receptor expression. Finally, we show that low expression of LINC00944 is correlated to poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. SIGNIFICANCE: Our study provides further evidence of the effect of ADAR1 over lncRNA expression levels, and on the participation of LINC00944 in breast cancer, suggesting to further investigate its potential role as prognostic biomarker.",2021 Mar 1,Life Sci. 2021 Mar 1;268:118956. doi: 10.1016/j.lfs.2020.118956.

33077959,RNA timestamps identify the age of single molecules in RNA sequencing.,"Current approaches to single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) provide only limited information about the dynamics of gene expression. Here we present RNA timestamps, a method for inferring the age of individual RNAs in RNA-seq data by exploiting RNA editing. To introduce timestamps, we tag RNA with a reporter motif consisting of multiple MS2 binding sites that recruit the adenosine deaminase ADAR2 fused to an MS2 capsid protein. ADAR2 binding to tagged RNA causes A-to-I edits to accumulate over time, allowing the age of the RNA to be inferred with hour-scale accuracy. By combining observations of multiple timestamped RNAs driven by the same promoter, we can determine when the promoter was active. We demonstrate that the system can infer the presence and timing of multiple past transcriptional events. Finally, we apply the method to cluster single cells according to the timing of past transcriptional activity. RNA timestamps will allow the incorporation of temporal information into RNA-seq workflows.",2021 Mar,Nat Biotechnol. 2021 Mar;39(3):320-325. doi: 10.1038/s41587-020-0704-z.

33307177,Sequence dependent influence of an A…A mismatch in a DNA duplex: An insight into the recognition by hZα(ADAR1) protein.,"Base pair mismatches can erroneously be incorporated in the DNA. An adenine pairing with another adenine is one of the eight possible mismatches. The atomistic insights about the structure and dynamics of an A…A mismatch in a DNA (unbound form) is not yet accessible to any experimental technique. Earlier molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have shown that A…A mismatch in the midst of 5'CAG/3'GAC, 5'GAC/3'CAG and 5'CAA/3'GAT (underline represents the mismatch) are highly dynamic in nature. By employing MD simulation, the influence of an A…A mismatch in the midst of 5'GAA/3'CAT, 5'GAG/3'CAC, 5'AAC/3'TAG, 5'AAG/3'TAC, 5'TAA/3'AAT, 5'TAT/3'AAA and 5'AAT/3'TAA sequences have been investigated here. The results indicate that irrespective of the flanking sequences, the mismatch samples a variety of transient conformations, including a B-Z junction. Further, circular dichroism studies have been carried out to explore the ability of these sequences to bind with hZα(ADAR1) which specifically recognizes B-Z junction/Z-DNA. The results indicate that hZα(ADAR1) could not lead to a complete B to Z transition in the above sequences. Notably, a complete transition to Z-form has been reported earlier for 5'GAC/3'CAG upon titrating with hZα(ADAR1). Intriguingly, 5'AAC/3'TAG, 5'AAG/3'TAC and 5'GAA/3'CAT exhibit a B-Z junction formation rather than a complete transition to Z-form, similar to the situation of 5'CAA/3'GAT. These indicate that although A…A mismatch could induce a local B-Z junction transiently, hZα(ADAR1) requires the presence of a G…C/C…G base pair adjacent to the A…A mismatch for the binding. Additionally, the extent of B-Z junction has enhanced upon binding with hZα(ADAR1) in the presence of the A…A mismatch (specifically when CG, CA, AC, GA and AG steps occur), but not in the presence of the canonical base pairs. These confirm the inclination of A…A mismatch towards the B-Z junction.",2021 Mar,J Struct Biol. 2021 Mar;213(1):107678. doi: 10.1016/j.jsb.2020.107678.

However, its genomic landscape and characters have not been systematically explored in the bovine genome. In the present study, we characterized global RNA editing profiles from 50 samples of cattle and revealed a range of RNA editing profiles in different tissues. Most editing sites were significantly enriched in specific BovB-derived SINEs, especially the dispersed Bov-tAs, which likely forms dsRNA structures similar to the primate-specific Alu elements. Interestingly, ADARB1 (ADAR2) was observed to be predominant in determining global editing in the bovine genome. Common RNA editing sites among similar tissues were associated with tissue-specific biological functions.

This study examined the psychometric properties of the mVLT among older persons with and without human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). METHODS: Sixty-eight persons with HIV and 36 HIV-negative individuals (aged 50-74) completed three trials of the mVLT on a smartphone once daily for 14 days. A different word list was administered each day. RESULTS: Participants completed 80% of the 14 mVLT administrations, equating to 1166 valid and complete mVLTs. Neither adherence nor mean mVLT total score (number correct in 3 recall trials) differed by HIV status. No practice effects from repeated mVLT administration were observed, and there were moderately strong correlations of mVLT performance with performance on the in-lab version of the task and with traditional cognitive assessments of cognitive processes contributing to memory. We found evidence of within-person learning across mVLT trials, with persons with HIV demonstrating less learning from trials 1 to 3 compared to HIV-negative participants. CONCLUSIONS: The mVLT is a valid method to assess learning in the real world in older adults with and without HIV.",2021 Mar,Int J Methods Psychiatr Res. 2021 Mar;30(1):e1859. doi: 10.1002/mpr.1859.

33575975,Identification and expression of adenosine deaminases acting on tRNA (ADAT) during early tail regeneration of the earthworm.,"BACKGROUND: RNA editing is a widespread phenomenon in all metazoans. One of the common RNA editing event is the chemical conversion of adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) catalyzed by adenosine deaminases acting on tRNA (ADAT). During D. melanogaster development, the ADAT1 transcript was found to localize mainly to the central nervous system including brain and ventral nerve cord during brain development. Although an earthworm adenosine deaminases acting on mRNA (ADAR) has been identified and its possible implication in earthworm regeneration has been investigated, there is little accumulated information on ADAT and tRNA editing in the annelid including terrestrial earthworms. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the molecular characteristics and the expression pattern of earthworm ADAT during tail regeneration to understand its physiological significance. METHODS: Nucleotide sequence of Ean-ADAT was retrieved from the genome assembly of Eisenia andrei via Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST). The genome assembly of Eisenia andrei was downloaded from National Genomics Data Center ( http://bigd.big.ac.cn/gwh/ ). The alignment and phylogenetic relationship of the core deaminase domains of ADATs and ADARs were analyzed. Its temporal expression during early tail regeneration was measured using real-time PCR. RESULTS: The open reading frame of Ean-ADAT consists of 1719 nucleotides encoding 573 amino acids. Domain analysis indicates that Ean-ADAT has a deaminase domain composed of 498 amino acids and a predicted nuclear localization signal at the N-terminal. Its subcellular localization was predicted to be nuclear. The core deaminase region of Ean-ADAT encompasses the three active-site motifs, including zinc-chelating residues and a glutamate residue for catalytic activity. In addition, Ean-ADAT shares highly conserved RNA recognition region flanking the third cysteine of the deaminase motif with other ADAT1s even from the yeast. Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis indicate that Ean-ADAT shows greater similarity to vertebrate ADARs than to yeast Tad1p. Ean-ADAT mRNA expression began to remarkably decrease before 12 h post-amputation, showing a tendency to gradual decrease until 7 dpa and then it slightly rebounded at 10 dpa. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that Ean-ADAT belongs to a class of ADAT1s and support the hypothesis of a common evolutionary origin for ADARs and ADATs. The temporal expression of Ean-ADAT could suggest that its activity is unrelated to the molecular mechanisms of dedifferentiation.",2021 Mar,Genes Genomics. 2021 Mar;43(3):295-301. doi: 10.1007/s13258-020-01031-6.

33905683,Deciphering the principles of the RNA editing code via large-scale systematic probing.,"Adenosine-to-inosine editing is catalyzed by ADAR1 at thousands of sites transcriptome-wide. Despite intense interest in ADAR1 from physiological, bioengineering, and therapeutic perspectives, the rules of ADAR1 substrate selection are poorly understood. Here, we used large-scale systematic probing of ∼2,000 synthetic constructs to explore the structure and sequence context determining editability. We uncover two structural layers determining the formation and propagation of A-to-I editing, independent of sequence. First, editing is robustly induced at fixed intervals of 35 bp upstream and 30 bp downstream of structural disruptions. Second, editing is symmetrically introduced on opposite sites on a double-stranded structure. Our findings suggest a recursive model for RNA editing, whereby the structural alteration induced by the editing at one site iteratively gives rise to the formation of an additional editing site at a fixed periodicity, serving as a basis for the propagation of editing along and across both strands of double-stranded RNA structures.",2021 Jun 3,Mol Cell. 2021 Jun 3;81(11):2374-2387.e3. doi: 10.1016/j.molcel.2021.03.024.

While RNA is subject to the formation of similar lesions as DNA, the evolutionary and physiological impacts RNA lesions have on viral genomes are yet to be characterized. Lesions that may drive the evolution of RNA genomes can induce breaks that are repaired by recombination or can cause base substitution mutagenesis, also known as base editing. Over the past decade or so, base editing mutagenesis of DNA genomes has been subject to many studies, revealing that exposure of ssDNA is subject to hypermutation that is involved in the etiology of cancer. However, base editing of RNA genomes has not been studied to the same extent. Recently hypermutation of single-stranded RNA viral genomes have also been documented though its role in evolution and population dynamics. Here, we will summarize the current knowledge of key mechanisms and causes of RNA genome instability covering areas from the RNA world theory to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic of today.

METHODS: Patients with nanophthalmos and available family members received a comprehensive ophthalmological examination. Genetic analysis was based on whole-exome sequencing and variant calling in core genes including MFRP, BEST1, TMEM98, PRSS56, CRB1, GJA1, C1QTNF5, MYRF and FAM111A. A minigene assay was performed for functional characterization of a splice site variant. RESULTS: Seven patients, aged between three and 65 years, from five unrelated families were included. Novel pathogenic variants in MFRP (c.497C>T, c.899-3C>A, c.1180G>A), and PRSS56 (c.1202C>A), and a recurrent de novo variant in FAM111A (c.1706G>A) in a patient with Kenny-Caffey syndrome type 2, were identified. In addition, we report co-inheritance of MFRP-related nanophthalmos and ADAR-related Aicardi-Goutières syndrome. CONCLUSION: Nanophthalmos is a genetically heterogeneous condition, and the severity of ocular manifestations appears not to correlate with variants in a specific gene. However, retinal dystrophy is only observed in patients harbouring pathogenic MFRP variants.

While oncogenic Sox2 largely maintains actions observed in normal tissue, Sox2 overexpression with p53 and p16 inactivation promotes chromatin remodeling and evolution of the Sox2 cistrome. With Klf5, oncogenic Sox2 acquires new binding sites and enhances activity of oncogenes such as Stat3.

35116583,Genome-wide expression changes mediated by A-to-I RNA editing correlate with hepatic oncogenesis.,"BACKGROUND: Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing is one of the most prevalent RNA modifications in the animal kingdom. Since inosine is recognized as guanosines, the A-to-I process mimics A-to-G DNA mutations but can be controlled in a more flexible manner compared to DNA alterations. METHODS: We parsed the transcriptomes and translatomes of liver cancer and normal tissues from ten patients. We profiled the landscape of the A-to-I RNA editome in these samples and interrogated whether the A-to-I processes participated in the gene expression regulation in oncogenesis. RESULTS: Globally, editing activity was enhanced in all tumor samples compared to that in normal samples. Accordingly, expression of the gene encoding the RNA editing enzyme ADAR (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA) was elevated. Two intronic self-editing sites in ADAR mRNAs controlled its splicing pattern and may regulate its translation efficiency (TE). Moreover, the expression of oncogenes was generally upregulated in tumors, whereas tumor suppressor genes (TSG) were downregulated, possibly due to alterations to microRNA binding sites or RNA splicing defects caused by A-to-I editing. CONCLUSIONS: A-to-I RNA editing plays a crucial role in the oncogenesis of liver cancer. ADAR regulates its own expression via self-editing, and it also affects global transcriptomes and translatomes involving cancer-related genes by RNA editing and changing their expression patterns.",2021 Jun,Transl Cancer Res. 2021 Jun;10(6):2725-2737. doi: 10.21037/tcr-21-236.,"['Li J', 'Li Q', 'Yu CP', 'Chang S', 'Xie LL', 'Wang S']",True

Let-7d is a microRNA of the conserved let-7 family that is dysregulated in female malignancies including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, and cervical cancer. Moreover, a dysregulation is observed in endometriosis and pregnancy-associated diseases such as preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction. Let-7d expression is regulated by cytokines and steroids, involving transcriptional regulation by OCT4, MYC and p53, as well as posttranscriptional regulation via LIN28 and ADAR. By downregulating a wide range of relevant mRNA targets, let-7d affects cellular processes that drive disease progression such as cell proliferation, apoptosis (resistance), angiogenesis and immune cell function. In an oncological context, let-7d has a tumor-suppressive function, although some of its functions are context-dependent. Notably, its expression is associated with improved therapeutic responses to chemotherapy in breast and ovarian cancer. Studies in mouse models have furthermore revealed important roles in uterine development and function, with implications for obstetric diseases. Apart from a possible utility as a diagnostic blood-based biomarker, pharmacological modulation of let-7d emerges as a promising therapeutic concept in a variety of female disease conditions.",2021 Jul 8,Int J Mol Sci. 2021 Jul 8;22(14):7359. doi: 10.3390/ijms22147359.,"['De Santis C', 'Götte M']",False

34332594,Aicardi-Goutières syndrome-associated mutation at ADAR1 gene locus activates innate immune response in mouse brain.,"BACKGROUND: Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS) is a severe infant or juvenile-onset autoimmune disease characterized by inflammatory encephalopathy with an elevated type 1 interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression signature in the brain. Mutations in seven different protein-coding genes, all linked to DNA/RNA metabolism or sensing, have been identified in AGS patients, but none of them has been demonstrated to activate the IFN pathway in the brain of an animal. The molecular mechanism of inflammatory encephalopathy in AGS has not been well defined. Adenosine Deaminase Acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) is one of the AGS-associated genes. It carries out A-to-I RNA editing that converts adenosine to inosine at double-stranded RNA regions. Whether an AGS-associated mutation in ADAR1 activates the IFN pathway and causes autoimmune pathogenesis in the brain is yet to be determined. METHODS: Mutations in the ADAR1 gene found in AGS patients were introduced into the mouse genome via CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Molecular activities of the specific p.K999N mutation were investigated by measuring the RNA editing levels in brain mRNA substrates of ADAR1 through RNA sequencing analysis. IFN pathway activation in the brain was assessed by measuring ISG expression at the mRNA and protein level through real-time RT-PCR and Luminex assays, respectively. The locations in the brain and neural cell types that express ISGs were determined by RNA in situ hybridization (ISH). Potential AGS-related brain morphologic changes were assessed with immunohistological analysis. Von Kossa and Luxol Fast Blue staining was performed on brain tissue to assess calcification and myelin, respectively. RESULTS: Mice bearing the ADAR1 p.K999N were viable though smaller than wild type sibs. RNA sequencing analysis of neuron-specific RNA substrates revealed altered RNA editing activities of the mutant ADAR1 protein. Mutant mice exhibited dramatically elevated levels of multiple ISGs within the brain. RNA ISH of brain sections showed selective activation of ISG expression in neurons and microglia in a patchy pattern. ISG-15 mRNA was upregulated in ADAR1 mutant brain neurons whereas CXCL10 mRNA was elevated in adjacent astroglia. No calcification or gliosis was detected in the mutant brain. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that an AGS-associated mutation in ADAR1, specifically the p.K999N mutation, activates the IFN pathway in the mouse brain. The ADAR1 p.K999N mutant mouse replicates aspects of the brain interferonopathy of AGS. Neurons and microglia express different ISGs. Basal ganglia calcification and leukodystrophy seen in AGS patients were not observed in K999N mutant mice, indicating that development of the full clinical phenotype may need an additional stimulus besides AGS mutations. This mutant mouse presents a robust tool for the investigation of AGS and neuroinflammatory diseases including the modeling of potential ""second hits"" that enable severe phenotypes of clinically variable diseases.",2021 Jul 31,J Neuroinflammation. 2021 Jul 31;18(1):169. doi: 10.1186/s12974-021-02217-9.,"['Guo X', 'Wiley CA', 'Steinman RA', 'Sheng Y', 'Ji B', 'Wang J', 'Zhang L', 'Wang T', 'Zenatai M', 'Billiar TR', 'Wang Q']",True
33941613,Targeting DDX3X Triggers Antitumor Immunity via a dsRNA-Mediated Tumor-Intrinsic Type I Interferon Response.,"Induction of nucleic acid sensing-mediated type I interferon (IFN) has emerged as a novel approach to activate the immune system against cancer. Here we show that the depletion of DEAD-box RNA helicase 3X (DDX3X) triggers a tumor-intrinsic type I IFN response in breast cancer cells. Depletion or inhibition of DDX3X activity led to aberrant cytoplasmic accumulation of cellular endogenous double-stranded RNAs (dsRNA), which triggered type I IFN production through the melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5)-mediated dsRNA-sensing pathway. Furthermore, DDX3X interacted with dsRNA-editing ADAR1 and dual depletion of DDX3X and ADAR1 synergistically activated the cytosolic dsRNA pathway in breast cancer cells. Loss of DDX3X in mouse mammary tumors enhanced antitumor activity by increasing the tumor-intrinsic type I IFN response, antigen presentation, and tumor infiltration of cytotoxic T and dendritic cells. These findings may lead to the development of a novel therapeutic approach for breast cancer by targeting DDX3X in combination with immune-checkpoint blockade. SIGNIFICANCE: This study elucidates the novel role of DDX3X in regulating endogenous cellular dsRNA homeostasis and type I IFN signaling in breast cancer.

34356042,An I for an A: Dynamic Regulation of Adenosine Deamination-Mediated RNA Editing.,"RNA-editing by adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) converts adenosines to inosines in structured RNAs. Inosines are read as guanosines by most cellular machineries. A to I editing has two major functions: first, marking endogenous RNAs as ""self"", therefore helping the innate immune system to distinguish repeat- and endogenous retrovirus-derived RNAs from invading pathogenic RNAs; and second, recoding the information of the coding RNAs, leading to the translation of proteins that differ from their genomically encoded versions. It is obvious that these two important biological functions of ADARs will differ during development, in different tissues, upon altered physiological conditions or after exposure to pathogens. Indeed, different levels of ADAR-mediated editing have been observed in different tissues, as a response to altered physiology or upon pathogen exposure. In this review, we describe the dynamics of A to I editing and summarize the known and likely mechanisms that will lead to global but also substrate-specific regulation of A to I editing.",2021 Jul 1,Genes (Basel). 2021 Jul 1;12(7):1026. doi: 10.3390/genes12071026.,"['Vesely C', 'Jantsch MF']",True
32719099,"Biallelic variants in ADARB1, encoding a dsRNA-specific adenosine deaminase, cause a severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathy.","BACKGROUND: Adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing is a co-transcriptional/post-transcriptional modification of double-stranded RNA, catalysed by one of two active adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs), ADAR1 and ADAR2. ADARB1 encodes the enzyme ADAR2 that is highly expressed in the brain and essential to modulate the function of glutamate and serotonin receptors. Impaired ADAR2 editing causes early onset progressive epilepsy and premature death in mice. In humans, ADAR2 dysfunction has been very recently linked to a neurodevelopmental disorder with microcephaly and epilepsy in four unrelated subjects. METHODS: We studied three children from two consanguineous families with severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) through detailed physical and instrumental examinations. Exome sequencing (ES) was used to identify ADARB1 mutations as the underlying genetic cause and in vitro assays with transiently transfected cells were performed to ascertain the impact on ADAR2 enzymatic activity and splicing. RESULTS: All patients showed global developmental delay, intractable early infantile-onset seizures, microcephaly, severe-to-profound intellectual disability, axial hypotonia and progressive appendicular spasticity. ES revealed the novel missense c.1889G>A, p.(Arg630Gln) and deletion c.1245_1247+1 del, p.(Leu415PhefsTer14) variants in ADARB1 (NM_015833.4). The p.(Leu415PhefsTer14) variant leads to incorrect splicing resulting in frameshift with a premature stop codon and loss of enzyme function. In vitro RNA editing assays showed that the p.(Arg630Gln) variant resulted in a severe impairment of ADAR2 enzymatic activity. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, these data support the pathogenic role of biallelic ADARB1 variants as the cause of a distinctive form of DEE, reinforcing the importance of RNA editing in brain function and development.",2021 Jul,J Med Genet. 2021 Jul;58(7):495-504. doi: 10.1136/jmedgenet-2020-107048.

34324489,N6-methyladenosine promotes induction of ADAR1-mediated A-to-I RNA editing to suppress aberrant antiviral innate immune responses.,"Among over 150 distinct RNA modifications, N6-methyladenosine (m6A) and adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing represent 2 of the most studied modifications on mammalian mRNAs. Although both modifications occur on adenosine residues, knowledge on potential functional crosstalk between these 2 modifications is still limited. Here, we show that the m6A modification promotes expression levels of the ADAR1, which encodes an A-to-I RNA editing enzyme, in response to interferon (IFN) stimulation. We reveal that YTH N6-methyladenosine RNA binding protein 1 (YTHDF1) mediates up-regulation of ADAR1; YTHDF1 is a reader protein that can preferentially bind m6A-modified transcripts and promote translation. Knockdown of YTHDF1 reduces the overall levels of IFN-induced A-to-I RNA editing, which consequently activates dsRNA-sensing pathway and increases expression of various IFN-stimulated genes. Physiologically, YTHDF1 deficiency inhibits virus replication in cells through regulating IFN responses. The A-to-I RNA editing activity of ADAR1 plays important roles in the YTHDF1-dependent IFN responses. Therefore, we uncover that m6A and YTHDF1 affect innate immune responses through modulating the ADAR1-mediated A-to-I RNA editing.",2021 Jul,PLoS Biol. 2021 Jul 29;19(7):e3001292. doi: 10.1371/journal.pbio.3001292. eCollection 2021 Jul.,"['Terajima H', 'Lu M', 'Zhang L', 'Cui Q', 'Shi Y', 'Li J', 'He C']",True

33446603,A-to-I editing of miR-200b-3p in airway cells is associated with moderate-to-severe asthma.,"BACKGROUND: Asthma is a chronic lung disease characterised by persistent airway inflammation. Altered microRNA (miRNA)-mediated gene silencing in bronchial epithelial cells (BECs) has been reported in asthma, yet adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR)-mediated miRNA editing in asthma remains unexplored. METHODS: We first identified adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) edited sites in miRNAs in BECs from 142 adult asthma cases and controls. A-to-I edited sites were tested for associations with asthma severity and clinical measures of asthma. Paired RNA sequencing data were used to perform pathway enrichments and test for associations with bioinformatically predicted target genes of the unedited and edited miRNAs. RESULTS: Of 19 A-to-I edited sites detected in these miRNAs, one site at position 5 of miR-200b-3p was edited less frequently in cases compared with controls (p(corrected)=0.013), and especially compared with cases with moderate (p(corrected)=0.029) and severe (p(corrected)=3.9×10(-4)), but not mild (p(corrected)=0.38), asthma. Bioinformatic prediction revealed 232 target genes of the edited miR-200b-3p, which were enriched for both interleukin-4 and interferon-γ signalling pathways, and included the SOCS1 (suppressor of cytokine signalling 1) gene. SOCS1 was more highly expressed in moderate (p(corrected)=0.017) and severe (p(corrected)=5.4×10(-3)) asthma cases compared with controls. Moreover, both miR-200b-3p editing and SOCS1 were associated with bronchoalveolar lavage eosinophil levels. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced A-to-I editing of position 5 of miR-200b-3p in lower airway cells from moderate-to-severe asthmatic subjects may lead to overexpression of SOCS1 and impaired cytokine signalling.

33894004,RNA editing-mediated regulation of calcium-dependent activator protein for secretion (CAPS1) localization and its impact on synaptic transmission.,"Calcium-dependent activator protein for secretion 1 (CAPS1) is a SNARE accessory protein that facilitates formation of the SNARE complex to enable neurotransmitter release. Messenger RNAs encoding CAPS1 are subject to a site-specific adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing event resulting in a glutamate-to-glycine (E-to-G) substitution in the C-terminal domain of the encoded protein product. The C-terminal domain of CAPS1 is necessary for its synaptic enrichment and Cadps RNA editing has been shown previously to enhance the release of neuromodulatory transmitters. Using mutant mouse lines engineered to solely express CAPS1 protein isoforms encoded by either the non-edited or edited Cadps transcript, primary neuronal cultures from mouse hippocampus were used to explore the effect of Cadps editing on neurotransmission and CAPS1 synaptic localization at both glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses. While the editing of Cadps does not alter baseline evoked neurotransmission, it enhances short-term synaptic plasticity, specifically short-term depression, at inhibitory synapses. Cadps editing also alters spontaneous inhibitory neurotransmission. Neurons that solely express edited Cadps have a greater proportion of synapses that contain CAPS1 than neurons that solely express non-edited Cadps for both glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses. Editing of Cadps transcripts is regulated by neuronal activity, as global network stimulation increases the extent of transcripts edited in wild-type hippocampal neurons, whereas chronic network silencing decreases the level of Cadps editing. Taken together, these results provide key insights into the importance of Cadps editing in modulating its own synaptic localization, as well as the modulation of neurotransmission at inhibitory synapses in hippocampal neurons.",2021 Jul,J Neurochem. 2021 Jul;158(2):182-196. doi: 10.1111/jnc.15372.

33781748,RNA editing enzyme ADAR1 governs the circadian expression of P-glycoprotein in human renal cells by regulating alternative splicing of the ABCB1 gene.,"The expression and function of some xenobiotic transporters vary according to the time of the day, causing the dosing time-dependent changes in drug disposition and toxicity. P-glycoprotein (P-gp), encoded by the ABCB1 gene, is highly expressed in the kidneys and functions in the renal elimination of various drugs. The elimination of several P-gp substrates was demonstrated to vary depending on administration time, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. We found that adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR1) was involved in the circadian regulation of P-gp expression in human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (RPTECs). After synchronization of the cellular circadian clock by dexamethasone treatment, the expression of P-gp exhibited a significant 24-h oscillation in RPTECs, but this oscillation was disrupted by the downregulation of ADAR1. Although ADAR1 catalyzes adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing in double-stranded RNA substrates, no significant ADAR1-regulated editing sites were detected in the human ABCB1 transcripts in RPTECs. On the other hand, downregulation of ADAR1 induced alternative splicing in intron 27 of the human ABCB1 gene, resulting in the production of retained intron transcripts. The aberrant spliced transcript was sensitive to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, leading to the decreased stability of ABCB1 mRNA and prevention of the 24-h oscillation of P-gp expression. These findings support the notion that ADAR1-mediated regulation of alternative splicing of the ABCB1 gene is a key mechanism of circadian expression of P-gp in RPTECs, and the regulatory mechanism may underlie the dosing time-dependent variations in the renal elimination of P-gp substrates.",2021 Jan-Jun,J Biol Chem. 2021 Jan-Jun;296:100601. doi: 10.1016/j.jbc.2021.100601.

ADAR mediated RNA editing is widespread in humans in which millions of A-to-I changes modify thousands of primary transcripts. RNA editing has pivotal roles in the regulation of gene expression or modulation of the innate immune response or functioning of several neurotransmitter receptors.

33430133,Editing and Chemical Modifications on Non-Coding RNAs in Cancer: A New Tale with Clinical Significance.,"Currently, for seemingly every type of cancer, dysregulated levels of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are reported and non-coding transcripts are expected to be the next class of diagnostic and therapeutic tools in oncology. Recently, alterations to the ncRNAs transcriptome have emerged as a novel hallmark of cancer. Historically, ncRNAs were characterized mainly as regulators and little attention was paid to the mechanisms that regulate them. The role of modifications, which can control the function of ncRNAs post-transcriptionally, only recently began to emerge. Typically, these modifications can be divided into reversible (i.e., chemical modifications: m(5)C, hm(5)C, m(6)A, m(1)A, and pseudouridine) and non-reversible (i.e., editing: ADAR dependent, APOBEC dependent and ADAR/APOBEC independent). The first research papers showed that levels of these modifications are altered in cancer and can be part of the tumorigenic process. Hence, the aim of this review paper is to describe the most common regulatory modifications (editing and chemical modifications) of the traditionally considered ""non-functional"" ncRNAs (i.e., microRNAs, long non-coding RNAs and circular RNAs) in the context of malignant disease. We consider that only by understanding this extra regulatory layer is it possible to translate the knowledge about ncRNAs and their modifications into clinical practice.",2021 Jan 8,Int J Mol Sci. 2021 Jan 8;22(2):581. doi: 10.3390/ijms22020581.,"['Torsin LI', 'Petrescu GED', 'Sabo AA', 'Chen B', 'Brehar FM', 'Dragomir MP', 'Calin GA']",False

Both these RNA modifications determine mRNA fate and play a pivotal role in tumor development and progression. RESULTS: Here, we show that METTL3, upregulated in glioblastoma, methylates ADAR1 mRNA and increases its protein level leading to a pro-tumorigenic mechanism connecting METTL3, YTHDF1, and ADAR1. We show that ADAR1 plays a cancer-promoting role independently of its deaminase activity by binding CDK2 mRNA, underlining the importance of ADARs as essential RNA-binding proteins for cell homeostasis as well as cancer progression.

33503434,Inflammation-driven deaminase deregulation fuels human pre-leukemia stem cell evolution.,"Inflammation-dependent base deaminases promote therapeutic resistance in many malignancies. However, their roles in human pre-leukemia stem cell (pre-LSC) evolution to acute myeloid leukemia stem cells (LSCs) had not been elucidated. Comparative whole-genome and whole-transcriptome sequencing analyses of FACS-purified pre-LSCs from myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) patients reveal APOBEC3C upregulation, an increased C-to-T mutational burden, and hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) proliferation during progression, which can be recapitulated by lentiviral APOBEC3C overexpression. In pre-LSCs, inflammatory splice isoform overexpression coincides with APOBEC3C upregulation and ADAR1p150-induced A-to-I RNA hyper-editing. Pre-LSC evolution to LSCs is marked by STAT3 editing, STAT3β isoform switching, elevated phospho-STAT3, and increased ADAR1p150 expression, which can be prevented by JAK2/STAT3 inhibition with ruxolitinib or fedratinib or lentiviral ADAR1 shRNA knockdown. Conversely, lentiviral ADAR1p150 expression enhances pre-LSC replating and STAT3 splice isoform switching. Thus, pre-LSC evolution to LSCs is fueled by primate-specific APOBEC3C-induced pre-LSC proliferation and ADAR1-mediated splicing deregulation.",2021 Jan 26,Cell Rep. 2021 Jan 26;34(4):108670. doi: 10.1016/j.celrep.2020.108670.,"['Jiang Q', 'Isquith J', 'Ladel L', 'Mark A', 'Holm F', 'Mason C', 'He Y', 'Mondala P', 'Oliver I', 'Pham J', 'Ma W', 'Reynoso E', 'Ali S', 'Morris IJ', 'Diep R', 'Nasamran C', 'Xu G', 'Sasik R', 'Rosenthal SB', 'Birmingham A', 'Coso S', 'Pineda G', 'Crews L', 'Donohoe ME', 'Venter JC', 'Whisenant T', 'Mesa RA', 'Alexandrov LB', 'Fisch KM', 'Jamieson C']",True
33530472,Loss of Cnot6l Impairs Inosine RNA Modifications in Mouse Oocytes.,"Mammalian oocytes must degrade maternal transcripts through a process called translational mRNA decay, in which maternal mRNA undergoes translational activation, followed by deadenylation and mRNA decay. Once a transcript is translationally activated, it becomes deadenylated by the CCR4-NOT complex. Knockout of CCR4-NOT Transcription Complex Subunit 6 Like (Cnot6l), a deadenylase within the CCR4-NOT complex, results in mRNA decay defects during metaphase I (MI) entry. Knockout of B-cell translocation gene-4 (Btg4), an adaptor protein of the CCR4-NOT complex, results in mRNA decay defects following fertilization. Therefore, mechanisms controlling mRNA turnover have significant impacts on oocyte competence and early embryonic development. Post-transcriptional inosine RNA modifications can impact mRNA stability, possibly through a translation mechanism. Here, we assessed inosine RNA modifications in oocytes, eggs, and embryos from Cnot6l(-/-) and Btg4(-/-) mice, which display stabilization of mRNA and over-translation of the stabilized transcripts. If inosine modifications have a role in modulating RNA stability, we hypothesize that in these mutant backgrounds, we would observe changes or a disruption in inosine mRNA modifications. To test this, we used a computational approach to identify inosine RNA modifications in total and polysomal RNA-seq data during meiotic maturation (GV, MI, and MII stages). We observed pronounced depletion of inosine mRNA modifications in samples from Cnot6l(-/-), but not in Btg4(-/-) mice. Additionally, analysis of ribosome-associated RNA revealed clearance of inosine modified mRNA. These observations suggest a novel mechanism of mRNA clearance during oocyte maturation, in which inosine-containing transcripts decay in an independent, but parallel mechanism to CCR4-NOT deadenylation.",2021 Jan 26,Int J Mol Sci. 2021 Jan 26;22(3):1191. doi: 10.3390/ijms22031191.,"['Brachova P', 'Alvarez NS', 'Christenson LK']",False
33482855,Systemic inflammation and chronic kidney disease in a patient due to the RNASEH2B defect.,"INTRODUCTION: Aicardi-Goutières (AGS) is a rare immune dysregulated disease due to mutations in TREX1, RNASEH2A, RNASEH2B, RNASEH2C, SAMHD1, ADAR1, or IFIH1. Clinical features include basal ganglia calcifications, white matter abnormalities, and cerebral atrophy. Severe systemic inflammation and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are extremely rare in AGS. Herein, we report a patient presenting with systemic inflammation and CKD to broaden the clinical phenotype spectrum of the RNASEH2B defect. METHODS: All testing and molecular genetic analysis were performed after obtaining the informed consent of the parents. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory findings were abstracted from outpatient and inpatient encounters. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) scans, and renal biopsy histopathology reports were reviewed and summarized. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed on peripheral blood cells. After exposure to cGAMP in vitro for 24 h, mRNA expression of 12 IFN-stimulated cytokine genes in PBMCs was assessed. Serum cytokine levels were detected by Milliplex. RESULTS: A 11-year-old girl presented with recurrent aseptic fever, arthritis, chilblains, failure to thrive, mild hearing loss, and neurological manifestations. Laboratory and immunologic findings demonstrated lymphopenia, low complement levels, positive autoantibodies, elevated levels of acute-phase reactants and inflammatory cytokines. Cerebral imaging showed cerebral atrophy, white matter abnormalities, and intracranial calcification. Renal biopsy showed glomerular sclerosis in 3 of 14 glomeruli, infiltration of lymphocytes and other mononuclear cells. WES revealed a homozygous and heterozygous mutations in RNASEH2B. Over-expression of IFN-stimulated cytokine genes was observed, including IFI44, IFI27, IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3, ISG15, OAS1, and SIGLEC1. CONCLUSIONS: To date, only two cases with AGS have been reported to have renal disease. Here, we describe a patient with both homozygous and heterozygous variants in RNASEH2B, presenting with neurological manifestations, persistently systemic autoinflammation, and CKD.

The ADAR-mediated adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing, an evolutionarily conserved mechanism, facilitates adaptive evolution by expanding proteomic diversities. Here, we characterize the A-to-I RNA editome of honeybees (Apis mellifera), identifying 407 high-confidence A-to-I editing sites. Editing is most abundant in the heads and shows signatures for positive selection. Editing behavior differs between foragers and nurses, suggesting a role for editing in caste differentiation. Although only five sites are conserved between bees and flies, an unexpectedly large number of genes exhibit editing in both species, albeit at different locations, including the nonsynonymous auto-editing of Adar.

33445472,Evaluation of the Interplay between the ADAR Editome and Immunotherapy in Melanoma.,"BACKGROUND: RNA editing is a highly conserved posttranscriptional mechanism that contributes to transcriptome diversity. In mammals, it includes nucleobase deaminations that convert cytidine (C) into uridine (U) and adenosine (A) into inosine (I). Evidence from cancer studies indicates that RNA-editing enzymes promote certain mechanisms of tumorigenesis. On the other hand, recoding editing in mRNA can generate mutations in proteins that can participate in the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) ligandome and can therefore be recognized by the adaptive immune system. Anti-cancer treatment based on the administration of immune checkpoint inhibitors enhance these natural anti-cancer immune responses. RESULTS: Based on RNA-Seq datasets, we evaluated the editome of melanoma cell lines generated from patients pre- and post-immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Our results reveal a differential editing in Arthrobacter luteus (Alu) sequences between samples pre-therapy and relapses during therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors. CONCLUSION: These data pave the way towards the development of new diagnostics and therapies targeted to editing that could help in preventing relapses during immunotherapies.",2021 Jan 12,Noncoding RNA. 2021 Jan 12;7(1):5. doi: 10.3390/ncrna7010005.,"['Tusup M', 'Cheng PF', 'Picardi E', 'Raziunaite A', 'Dummer R', 'Levesque MP', 'French LE', 'Guenova E', 'Kundig TM', 'Pascolo S']",True
33252250,ADAR1 deficiency protects against high-fat diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance in mice.,"Obesity is an important independent risk factor for type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and many other chronic diseases. The objective of this study was to determine the role of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) in the development of obesity and insulin resistance. Wild-type (WT) and heterozygous ADAR1-deficient (Adar1(+/-)) mice were fed normal chow or a high-fat diet (HFD) for 12 wk. Adar1(+/-) mice fed with HFD exhibited a lean phenotype with reduced fat mass compared with WT controls, although no difference was found under chow diet conditions. Blood biochemical analysis and insulin tolerance test showed that Adar1(+/-) improved HFD-induced dyslipidemia and insulin resistance. Metabolic studies showed that food intake was decreased in Adar1(+/-) mice compared with the WT mice under HFD conditions. Paired feeding studies further demonstrated that Adar1(+/-) protected mice from HFD-induced obesity through decreased food intake. Furthermore, Adar1(+/-) restored the increased ghrelin expression in the stomach and the decreased serum peptide YY levels under HFD conditions. These data indicate that ADAR1 may contribute to diet-induced obesity, at least partially, through modulating the ghrelin and peptide YY expression and secretion.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This study identifies adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 as a novel factor promoting high-fat diet-induced obesity, at least partially, through modulating appetite-related genes ghrelin and PYY.",2021 Jan 1,Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab. 2021 Jan 1;320(1):E131-E138. doi: 10.1152/ajpendo.00175.2020.

32693003,RNA editing mediates the functional switch of COPA in a novel mechanism of hepatocarcinogenesis.,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: RNA editing introduces nucleotide changes in RNA sequences. Recent studies have reported that aberrant adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing is implicated in cancers. Until now, very few functionally important protein-recoding editing targets have been discovered. Here, we investigated the role of a recently discovered protein-recoding editing target COPA (coatomer subunit α) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: Clinical implication of COPA editing was studied in a cohort of 125 HCC patients. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of the editing site complementary sequence (ECS) was used to delete edited COPA transcripts endogenously. COPA editing-mediated change in its transcript or protein stability was investigated upon actinomycin D or cycloheximide treatment, respectively. Functional difference in tumourigenesis between wild-type and edited COPA (COPA(WT)vs. COPA(I164V)) and the exact mechanisms were also studied in cell models and mice. RESULTS: ADAR2 binds to double-stranded RNA formed between edited exon 6 and the ECS at intron 6 of COPA pre-mRNA, causing an isoleucine-to-valine substitution at residue 164. Reduced editing of COPA is implicated in the pathogenesis of HCC, and more importantly, it may be involved in many cancer types. Upon editing, COPA(WT) switches from a tumour-promoting gene to a tumour suppressor that has a dominant-negative effect. Moreover, COPA(I164V) may undergo protein conformational change and therefore become less stable than COPA(WT). Mechanistically, COPA(I164V) may deactivate the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway through downregulation of caveolin-1 (CAV1). CONCLUSIONS: We uncover an RNA editing-associated mechanism of hepatocarcinogenesis by which downregulation of ADAR2 caused the loss of tumour suppressive COPA(I164V) and concurrent accumulation of tumour-promoting COPA(WT) in tumours; a rapid degradation of COPA(I164V) protein and hyper-activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway further promote tumourigenesis. LAY SUMMARY: RNA editing is a process in which RNA is changed after it is made from DNA, resulting in an altered gene product. In this study, we found that RNA editing of a gene known as coatomer subunit α (COPA) is lower in tumour samples and discovered that this editing process changes COPA protein from a tumour-promoting form to a tumour-suppressive form. Loss of the edited COPA promotes the development of liver cancer.",2021 Jan,J Hepatol. 2021 Jan;74(1):135-147. doi: 10.1016/j.jhep.2020.07.021.

33110236,Evaluating the therapeutic potential of ADAR1 inhibition for triple-negative breast cancer.,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the deadliest form of breast cancer. Unlike other types of breast cancer that can be effectively treated by targeted therapies, no such targeted therapy exists for all TNBC patients. The ADAR1 enzyme carries out A-to-I editing of RNA to prevent sensing of endogenous double-stranded RNAs. ADAR1 is highly expressed in breast cancer including TNBC. Here, we demonstrate that expression of ADAR1, specifically its p150 isoform, is required for the survival of TNBC cell lines. In TNBC cells, knockdown of ADAR1 attenuates proliferation and tumorigenesis. Moreover, ADAR1 knockdown leads to robust translational repression. ADAR1-dependent TNBC cell lines also exhibit elevated IFN stimulated gene expression. IFNAR1 reduction significantly rescued the proliferative defects of ADAR1 loss. These findings establish ADAR1 as a novel therapeutic target for TNBC tumors.",2021 Jan,Oncogene. 2021 Jan;40(1):189-202. doi: 10.1038/s41388-020-01515-5.

33355311,Profiling neural editomes reveals a molecular mechanism to regulate RNA editing during development.,"Adenosine (A) to inosine (I) RNA editing contributes to transcript diversity and modulates gene expression in a dynamic, cell type-specific manner. During mammalian brain development, editing of specific adenosines increases, whereas the expression of A-to-I editing enzymes remains unchanged, suggesting molecular mechanisms that mediate spatiotemporal regulation of RNA editing exist. Herein, by using a combination of biochemical and genomic approaches, we uncover a molecular mechanism that regulates RNA editing in a neural- and development-specific manner. Comparing editomes during development led to the identification of neural transcripts that were edited only in one life stage. The stage-specific editing is largely regulated by differential gene expression during neural development. Proper expression of nearly one-third of the neurodevelopmentally regulated genes is dependent on adr-2, the sole A-to-I editing enzyme in C. elegans However, we also identified a subset of neural transcripts that are edited and expressed throughout development. Despite a neural-specific down-regulation of adr-2 during development, the majority of these sites show increased editing in adult neural cells. Biochemical data suggest that ADR-1, a deaminase-deficient member of the adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) family, is competing with ADR-2 for binding to specific transcripts early in development. Our data suggest a model in which during neural development, ADR-2 levels overcome ADR-1 repression, resulting in increased ADR-2 binding and editing of specific transcripts. Together, our findings reveal tissue- and development-specific regulation of RNA editing and identify a molecular mechanism that regulates ADAR substrate recognition and editing efficiency.",2021 Jan,Genome Res. 2021 Jan;31(1):27-39. doi: 10.1101/gr.267575.120.

33738124,SARS-CoV-2 genomic analyses in cancer patients reveal elevated intrahost genetic diversity.,"Numerous factors have been identified to influence susceptibility to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and disease severity. Cancer patients are more prone to clinically evolve to more severe COVID-19 conditions, but the determinants of such a more severe outcome remain largely unknown. We have determined the full-length SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences of cancer patients and healthcare workers (non-cancer controls) by deep sequencing and investigated the within-host viral population of each infection, quantifying intrahost genetic diversity. Naso- and oropharyngeal SARS-CoV-2(+) swabs from 57 cancer patients and 14 healthcare workers from the Brazilian National Cancer Institute were collected in April to May 2020. Complete genome amplification using ARTIC network V3 multiplex primers was performed followed by next-generation sequencing. Assemblies were conducted in Geneious R11, where consensus sequences were extracted and intrahost single nucleotide variants were identified. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis was performed using PhyMLv.3.0 and lineages were classified using Pangolin and CoV-GLUE. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all but one strain belonged to clade B1.1. Four genetically linked mutations known as the globally dominant SARS-CoV-2 haplotype (C241T, C3037T, C14408T and A23403G) were found in the majority of consensus sequences. SNV signatures of previously characterized Brazilian genomes were also observed in most samples. Another 85 SNVs were found at a lower frequency (1.4%-19.7%) among the consensus sequences. Cancer patients displayed a significantly higher intrahost viral genetic diversity compared to healthcare workers. This difference was independent of SARS-CoV-2 Ct values obtained at the diagnostic tests, which did not differ between the two groups. The most common nucleotide changes of intrahost SNVs in both groups were consistent with APOBEC and ADAR activities. Intrahost genetic diversity in cancer patients was not associated with disease severity, use of corticosteroids, or use of antivirals, characteristics that could influence viral diversity. Moreover, the presence of metastasis, either in general or specifically in the lung, was not associated with intrahost diversity among cancer patients. Cancer patients carried significantly higher numbers of minor variants compared to non-cancer counterparts. Further studies on SARS-CoV-2 diversity in especially vulnerable patients will shed light onto the understanding of the basis of COVID-19 different outcomes in humans.",2021 Jan,Virus Evol. 2021 Feb 16;7(1):veab013. doi: 10.1093/ve/veab013. eCollection 2021 Jan.,"['Siqueira JD', 'Goes LR', 'Alves BM', 'de Carvalho PS', 'Cicala C', 'Arthos J', 'Viola JPB', 'de Melo AC', 'Soares MA']",False
33542240,Recognition of non-CpG repeats in Alu and ribosomal RNAs by the Z-RNA binding domain of ADAR1 induces A-Z junctions.,"Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing of eukaryotic cellular RNAs is essential for protection against auto-immune disorders. Editing is carried out by ADAR1, whose innate immune response-specific cytoplasmic isoform possesses a Z-DNA binding domain (Zα) of unknown function. Zα also binds to CpG repeats in RNA, which are a hallmark of Z-RNA formation. Unexpectedly, Zα has been predicted - and in some cases even shown - to bind to specific regions within mRNA and rRNA devoid of such repeats. Here, we use NMR, circular dichroism, and other biophysical approaches to demonstrate and characterize the binding of Zα to mRNA and rRNA fragments. Our results reveal a broad range of RNA sequences that bind to Zα and adopt Z-RNA conformations. Binding is accompanied by destabilization of neighboring A-form regions which is similar in character to what has been observed for B-Z-DNA junctions. The binding of Zα to non-CpG sequences is specific, cooperative and occurs with an affinity in the low micromolar range. This work allows us to propose a model for how Zα could influence the RNA binding specificity of ADAR1.",2021 Feb 4,Nat Commun. 2021 Feb 4;12(1):793. doi: 10.1038/s41467-021-21039-0.,"['Nichols PJ', 'Bevers S', 'Henen M', 'Kieft JS', 'Vicens Q', 'Vögeli B']",False
33627618,RNA editing of the 5-HT2C receptor in the central nucleus of the amygdala is involved in resilience behavior.,"Post-traumatic-stress-disorder (PTSD) is a stress-related condition that may develop after exposure to a severe trauma-event. One of the core brain areas that is considered to be a key regulatory region of PTSD is the amygdala. Specifically, the central amygdala (CeA) is involved in emotion processing and associative fear learning memory, two main circuits involved in PTSD. Long term dysregulation of trauma-related emotional processing may be caused by neuroadaptations that affect gene expression. The adenosine-(A) to-inosine (I) RNA editing machinery is a post-transcriptional process that converts a genomic encoded A to I and is critical for normal brain function and development. Such editing has the potential to increase the transcriptome diversity, and disruption of this process has been linked to various central nervous system disorders. Here, we employed a unique animal model to examine the possibility that the RNA editing machinery is involved in PTSD. Detection of RNA editing specifically in the CeA revealed changes in the editing pattern of the 5-HT2C serotonin receptor (5-HT2CR) transcript accompanied by dynamic changes in the expression levels of the ADAR family enzymes (ADAR and ADARb1). Deamination by ADAR and ADARb1 enzymes induces conformational changes in the 5-HT2CR that decrease the G-protein-coupling activity, agonist affinity, and thus serotonin signaling. Significantly, a single intra-CeA administration of a 5-HT2CR pharmacological antagonist produced a robust alleviation of PTSD-like behaviors (that was maintained for three weeks) as well as single systemic treatment. This work may suggest the way to a new avenue in the understanding of PTSD regulation.",2021 Feb 24,Transl Psychiatry. 2021 Feb 24;11(1):137. doi: 10.1038/s41398-021-01252-7.,"['Warhaftig G', 'Sokolik CM', 'Khermesh K', 'Lichtenstein Y', 'Barak M', 'Bareli T', 'Levanon EY', 'Yadid G']",True

The decomposition of minor variants profiles unveils three non-overlapping mutational signatures related to nucleotide substitutions and likely ruled by APOlipoprotein B Editing Complex (APOBEC), Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), and Adenosine Deaminase Acting on RNA (ADAR), highlighting heterogeneous host responses to SARS-CoV-2 infections. A corrected-for-signatures dN/dS analysis demonstrates that such mutational processes are affected by purifying selection, with important exceptions. In fact, several mutations appear to transit toward clonality, defining new clonal genotypes that increase the overall genomic diversity. Furthermore, the phylogenomic analysis shows the presence of homoplasies and supports the hypothesis of transmission of minor variants.

33158637,PNPT1 mutations may cause Aicardi-Goutières-Syndrome.,"BACKGROUND: Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS) is a clinically and genetically heterogenous autoinflammatory disorder caused by constitutive activation of the type I interferon axis. It has been associated with the genes TREX1, RNASEH2A, RNASEH2B, RNASEH2C, SAMHD1, ADAR1, IFIH1. The clinical diagnosis of AGS is usually made in the context of early-onset encephalopathy in combination with basal ganglia calcification or white matter abnormalities on cranial MRI and laboratory prove of interferon I activation. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a patient with early-onset encephalopathy, severe neurodevelopmental regression, progressive secondary microcephaly, epilepsy, movement disorder, and white matter hyperintensities on T2 weighted MRI images. Via whole-exome sequencing, we identified a novel homozygous missense variant (c.1399C > T, p.Pro467Ser) in PNPT1 (NM_033109). Longitudinal assessment of the interferon signature showed a massively elevated interferon score and chronic type I interferon-mediated autoinflammation. CONCLUSION: Bi-allelic mutations in PNPT1 have been reported in early-onset encephalopathy. Insufficient nuclear RNA import into mitochondria with consecutive disruption of the respiratory chain was proposed as the main underlying pathomechanism. Recent studies have shown that PNPT1 deficiency causes an accumulation of double-stranded mtRNAs in the cytoplasm, leading to aberrant type I interferon activation, however, longitudinal assessment has been lacking. Here, we present a case of AGS with continuously elevated type I interferon signature with a novel likely-pathogenic homozygous PNTP1 variant.

Increasingly, a spectrum of neurological dysfunction and presentation beyond the infantile period is being recognized in AGS. The aim of this study was to characterize late-infantile and juvenile-onset AGS. METHODS: We conducted a multi-institution review of individuals with AGS who were older than one year at the time of presentation, including medical history, imaging characteristics, and suspected diagnoses at presentation. RESULTS: Thirty-four individuals were identified, all with pathogenic variants in RNASEH2B, SAMHD1, ADAR1, or IFIH1. Most individuals had a history of developmental delay and/or systemic symptoms, such as sterile pyrexias and chilblains, followed by a prodromal period associated with increasing symptoms. This was followed by an abrupt onset of neurological decline (fulminant phase), with a median onset at 1.33 years (range 1.00 to 17.68 years). Most individuals presented with a change in gross motor skills (97.0%), typically with increased tone (78.8%). Leukodystrophy was the most common magnetic resonance imaging finding (40.0%). Calcifications were less common (12.9%). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to characterize the presentation of late-infantile and juvenile onset AGS and its phenotypic spectrum. Late-onset AGS can present insidiously and lacks classical clinical and neuroimaging findings.

34152393,Node similarity-based graph convolution for link prediction in biological networks.,"BACKGROUND: Link prediction is an important and well-studied problem in network biology. Recently, graph representation learning methods, including Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)-based node embedding have drawn increasing attention in link prediction. MOTIVATION: An important component of GCN-based network embedding is the convolution matrix, which is used to propagate features across the network. Existing algorithms use the degree-normalized adjacency matrix for this purpose, as this matrix is closely related to the graph Laplacian, capturing the spectral properties of the network. In parallel, it has been shown that GCNs with a single layer can generate more robust embeddings by reducing the number of parameters. Laplacian-based convolution is not well suited to single-layered GCNs, as it limits the propagation of information to immediate neighbors of a node. RESULTS: Capitalizing on the rich literature on unsupervised link prediction, we propose using node similarity-based convolution matrices in GCNs to compute node embeddings for link prediction. We consider eight representative node-similarity measures (Common Neighbors, Jaccard Index, Adamic-Adar, Resource Allocation, Hub- Depressed Index, Hub-Promoted Index, Sorenson Index and Salton Index) for this purpose. We systematically compare the performance of the resulting algorithms against GCNs that use the degree-normalized adjacency matrix for convolution, as well as other link prediction algorithms. In our experiments, we use three-link prediction tasks involving biomedical networks: drug-disease association prediction, drug-drug interaction prediction and protein-protein interaction prediction.

34419568,ADAR3 alleviated inflammation and pyroptosis of neuropathic pain by targeting NLRP3 in chronic constriction injury mice.,"BACKGROUND: Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 3 (ADAR3) was known as a prognosis factor in gliomas, while its function on neuropathic pain (NP) is barely investigated. Therefore, our present study concentrated on the potential role of ADAR3 in NP. METHODS: The chronic constriction injury (CCI) mouse model was established to induce NP in vivo. Behavioral experiments were carried out to analyze mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia. RT-qPCR and western blotting assays were used to detect the mRNA and protein expressions. The ADAR3-overexpressed adenovirus was injected into the CCI mice through an intrathecal catheter. ELISA was used to detect the contents of IL (interleukin)-6, IL-10, TNF (tumor necrosis factor)-α, IL-1β and IL-18. NLR Family Pyrin Domain Containing 3 (NLRP3) was predicted to be the target gene of ADAR3 using Starbase. The interaction between ADAR3 and NLRP3 was verified via RNA pull-down, RNA immunoprecipitation and Pearson's correlation coefficient assays. Immunohistochemical staining assay visualized the expressions of NLRP3 and caspase1. RESULTS: Allodynia and hyperalgesia were exacerbated in the CCI mice, which implied a successful establishment of the NP model, while ADAR3 expression level was suppressed. After injecting ADAR3-overexpressed adenovirus into the CCI mice, allodynia, hyperalgesia and inflammation were all restrained. Moreover, NLRP3 was verified to negatively correlated with ADAR3. Additionally, the pyroptosis-related protein NLRP3, ASC, caspase1, IL-1β, IL-18 and GSDMD expressions were all decreased by ADAR3. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, ADAR3 alleviated inflammation and pyroptosis of NP through targeting NLRP3, which suggested a therapeutical target for NP.",2021 Dec 30,Gene. 2021 Dec 30;805:145909. doi: 10.1016/j.gene.2021.145909.

34760335,Global RNA editing identification and characterization during human pluripotent-to-cardiomyocyte differentiation.,"RNA editing is widely involved in stem cell differentiation and development; however, RNA editing events during human cardiomyocyte differentiation have not yet been characterized and elucidated. Here, we identified genome-wide RNA editing sites and systemically characterized their genomic distribution during four stages of human cardiomyocyte differentiation. It was found that the expression level of ADAR1 affected the global number of adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) editing sites but not the editing degree. Next, we identified 43, 163, 544, and 141 RNA editing sites that contribute to changes in amino acid sequences, variation in alternative splicing, alterations in miRNA-target binding, and changes in gene expression, respectively. Generally, RNA editing showed a stage-specific pattern with 211 stage-shared editing sites. Interestingly, cardiac muscle contraction and heart-disease-related pathways were enriched by cardio-specific editing genes, emphasizing the connection between cardiomyocyte differentiation and heart diseases from the perspective of RNA editing. Finally, it was found that these RNA editing sites are also related to several congenital and noncongenital heart diseases. Together, our study provides a new perspective on cardiomyocyte differentiation and offers more opportunities to understand the mechanisms underlying cell fate determination, which can promote the development of cardiac regenerative medicine and therapies for human heart diseases.",2021 Dec 3,Mol Ther Nucleic Acids. 2021 Oct 8;26:879-891. doi: 10.1016/j.omtn.2021.10.001. eCollection 2021 Dec 3.,"['Chen J', 'Liu HF', 'Qiao LB', 'Wang FB', 'Wang L', 'Lin Y', 'Liu J']",True
35052382,Detection of A-to-I RNA Editing in SARS-COV-2.,"ADAR1-mediated deamination of adenosines in long double-stranded RNAs plays an important role in modulating the innate immune response. However, recent investigations based on metatranscriptomic samples of COVID-19 patients and SARS-COV-2-infected Vero cells have recovered contrasting findings. Using RNAseq data from time course experiments of infected human cell lines and transcriptome data from Vero cells and clinical samples, we prove that A-to-G changes observed in SARS-COV-2 genomes represent genuine RNA editing events, likely mediated by ADAR1. While the A-to-I editing rate is generally low, changes are distributed along the entire viral genome, are overrepresented in exonic regions, and are (in the majority of cases) nonsynonymous. The impact of RNA editing on virus-host interactions could be relevant to identify potential targets for therapeutic interventions.",2021 Dec 23,Genes (Basel). 2021 Dec 23;13(1):41. doi: 10.3390/genes13010041.,"['Picardi E', 'Mansi L', 'Pesole G']",True

To date, none of the mouse models carrying an AGS-causative mutation has mimicked such brain pathology. Here, we established a mutant mouse model carrying a K948N point mutation, corresponding to an AGS-causative K999N mutation, located in a deaminase domain of the Adar1 gene that encodes an RNA editing enzyme. Adar1(K948N/K948N) mice displayed postnatal growth retardation. Hyperplasia of splenic white pulps with germinal centers and hepatic focal inflammation were observed from 2 mo of age. Inflammation developed in the lungs and heart with lymphocyte infiltration in an age-dependent manner. Furthermore, white matter abnormalities with astrocytosis and microgliosis were detected at 1 y of age. The increased expression of IFN-stimulated genes was detected in multiple organs, including the brain, from birth. In addition, single-nucleus RNA sequencing revealed that this elevated expression of IFN-stimulated genes was commonly observed in all neuronal subtypes, including neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes. We further showed that a K948N point mutation reduced the RNA editing activity of ADAR1 in vivo. The pathological abnormalities found in Adar1(K948N/K948N) mice were ameliorated by either the concurrent deletion of MDA5, a cytosolic sensor of unedited transcripts, or the sole expression of active ADAR1 p150, an isoform of ADAR1. Collectively, such data suggest that although the degree is mild, Adar1(K948N/K948N) mice mimic multiple AGS phenotypes, including encephalopathy, which is caused by reduced RNA editing activity of the ADAR1 p150 isoform.",2021 Dec 15,J Immunol. 2021 Dec 15;207(12):3016-3027. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.2100526.

RNA-binding motif protein 8a (RBM8A) mRNA editing increases in mouse tissues upon asbestos exposure. The aim of this study was to further characterize the role of RBM8A in mesothelioma and the consequences of its mRNA editing. RBM8A protein expression was higher in mesothelioma compared to mesothelial cells. Silencing RBM8A changed splicing patterns in mesothelial and mesothelioma cells but drastically reduced viability only in mesothelioma cells. In the tissues of asbestos-exposed mice, editing of Rbm8a mRNA was associated with increased protein immunoreactivity, with no change in mRNA levels. Increased adenosine deaminase acting on dsRNA (ADAR)-dependent editing of Alu elements in the RBM8A 3'UTR was observed in mesothelioma cells compared to mesothelial cells. Editing stabilized protein expression. The unedited RBM8A 3'UTR had a stronger interaction with Musashi (MSI) compared to the edited form. The silencing of MSI2 in mesothelioma or overexpression of Adar2 in mesothelial cells resulted in increased RBM8A protein levels. Therefore, ADAR-dependent editing contributes to maintaining elevated RBM8A protein levels in mesothelioma by counteracting MSI2-driven downregulation. A wider implication of this mechanism for the translational control of protein expression is suggested by the editing of similarly structured Alu elements in several other transcripts.",2021 Dec 15,Cells. 2021 Dec 15;10(12):3543. doi: 10.3390/cells10123543.,"['Abukar A', 'Wipplinger M', 'Hariharan A', 'Sun S', 'Ronner M', 'Sculco M', 'Okonska A', 'Kresoja-Rakic J', 'Rehrauer H', 'Qi W', 'Beusechem VWV', 'Felley-Bosco E']",False
34536489,A new strategy to increase RNA editing at the Q/R site of GluA2 AMPA receptor subunits by targeting alternative splicing patterns of ADAR2.,"BACKGROUND: The GluA2 subunit of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) undergoes RNA editing at a specific base mediated by the enzyme ADAR2, changing the coded amino acid from a glutamine to arginine at the so-called Q/R site, which is critical for regulating calcium permeability. ADAR2 exists as multiple alternatively-spliced variants within mammalian cells with differing editing efficiency. NEW METHOD: In this study, phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs) were used to increase Q/R site editing, by affecting the alternative splicing of ADAR2. RESULTS: PMOs targeting the ADAR2 pre-mRNA transcript successfully induced alternative splicing around the AluJ cassette leading to expression of a more active isoform with increased editing of the GluA2 subunit compared to control. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD(S): Previously PMOs have been used to disrupt RNA editing via steric hindrance of the GluA2 RNA duplex. In contrast we report PMOs that can increase the expression of more catalytically active variants of ADAR2, leading to enhanced GluA2 Q/R RNA editing. CONCLUSIONS: Using PMOs to increase Q/R site editing is presented here as a validated method that would allow investigation of downstream cellular processes implicated in altered ADAR2 activity.",2021 Dec 1,J Neurosci Methods. 2021 Dec 1;364:109357. doi: 10.1016/j.jneumeth.2021.109357.

Our aim was to evaluate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with advanced liver fibrosis in HIV-1/HCV co-infected patients. DESIGN/METHODS: In a cohort of 102 participants, we genotyped 16 SNPs in 10 genes previously associated with NAFLD and the innate immune response and correlated the genotypes with liver fibrosis and fat accumulation. RESULTS: Multinomial logistic regression analysis identified three metabolic parameters that were significantly associated with advanced liver fibrosis (stage F3-F4): albumin [odds ratio (OR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.69-0.91, P = 0.001], percentage of visceral fat area (PVFA) (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.01-1.12, P = 0.03) and BMI (OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.22-1.77, P < 0.0001).

34402744,Host-dependent editing of SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients.,"A common trait among RNA viruses is their high capability to acquire genetic variability due to viral and host mechanisms. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis enables the deep study of the viral quasispecies in samples from infected individuals. In this study, the viral quasispecies complexity and single nucleotide polymorphisms of the SARS-CoV-2 spike gene of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with mild or severe disease were investigated using next-generation sequencing (Illumina platform). SARS-CoV-2 spike variability was higher in patients with long-lasting infection. Most substitutions found were present at frequencies lower than 1%, and had an A → G or T → C pattern, consistent with variants caused by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA-1 (ADAR1). ADAR1 affected a small fraction of replicating genomes, but produced multiple, mainly non-synonymous mutations. ADAR1 editing during replication rather than the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12) was the predominant mechanism generating SARS-CoV-2 genetic variability. However, the mutations produced are not fixed in the infected human population, suggesting that ADAR1 may have an antiviral role, whereas nsp12-induced mutations occurring in patients with high viremia and persistent infection are the main source of new SARS-CoV-2 variants.",2021 Dec,Emerg Microbes Infect. 2021 Dec;10(1):1777-1789. doi: 10.1080/22221751.2021.1969868.,"['Gregori J', 'Cortese MF', 'Piñana M', 'Campos C', 'Garcia-Cehic D', 'Andrés C', 'Abril JF', 'Codina MG', 'Rando A', 'Esperalba J', 'Sulleiro E', 'Joseph J', 'Saubí N', 'Colomer-Castell S', 'Martin MC', 'Castillo C', 'Esteban JI', 'Pumarola T', 'Rodriguez-Frias F', 'Antón A', 'Quer J']",False
34552007,Growth Inhibition and Induction of Innate Immune Signaling of Chondrosarcomas with Epigenetic Inhibitors.,"Chondrosarcomas are inherently resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, pointing to an unmet need for new treatment options. Immune checkpoint inhibitors, which have shown remarkable promise in multiple solid cancer types, have limited efficacy in chondrosarcomas. Mutations in IDH1/2 genes, which result in progressive increases in DNA and histone methylation, are observed in 50% of conventional chondrosarcomas, suggesting that epigenetic dysregulation represents a potential barrier for tumor progression and target for therapeutic intervention. Here, we demonstrated that combined treatment of FDA-approved inhibitors of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza), and histone deacetylases (HDACs) suberanilohydroxamic acid (SAHA) impaired the proliferation of chondrosarcoma cell lines in vitro and in xenograft studies. Transcriptomic analysis reveals that chondrosarcoma cells treated with 5-aza and SAHA markedly elevated the expression of IFN-stimulated genes including PD-L1, indicating that these epigenetic drugs induced a potent innate immune response. We demonstrated that 5-aza and SAHA resulted in both genomic and epigenomic instability, as shown by elevated DNA damage response and derepression of retrotransposons, respectively, which in turn activated pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and the downstream IFN signaling pathways. Importantly, the cytotoxic effects of 5-aza and SAHA can be rescued by depletion of PRRs such as cGAS and MAVS, and potentiated by depletion of the RNA-editing enzyme ADAR1. Together, our results demonstrate preclinical activity of combined DNMT and HDAC inhibition against chondrosarcomas and suggest that targeted epigenetic therapies could represent a new therapeutic approach in the treatment of chondrosarcomas, and this is being tested in an ongoing clinical trial (NCT04340843).",2021 Dec,Mol Cancer Ther. 2021 Dec;20(12):2362-2371. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-21-0066.

34857436,Adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing contributes to type I interferon responses in systemic sclerosis.,"OBJECTIVE: Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA-1 (ADAR1) enzyme is a type I interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene (ISG) catalyzing the deamination of adenosine-to-inosine, a process called A-to-I RNA editing. A-to-I RNA editing takes place mainly in Alu elements comprising a primate-specific level of post-transcriptional gene regulation. Whether RNA editing is involved in type I IFN responses in systemic sclerosis (SSc) patients remains unknown. METHODS: ISG expression was quantified in skin biopsies and peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived from SSc patients and healthy subjects. A-to-I RNA editing was examined in the ADAR1-target cathepsin S (CTSS) by an RNA editing assay. The effect of ADAR1 on interferon-α/β-induced CTSS expression was assessed in human endothelial cells in vitro. RESULTS: Increased expression levels of the RNA editor ADAR1, and specifically the long ADAR1p150 isoform, and its target CTSS are strongly associated with type I IFN signature in skin biopsies and peripheral blood derived from SSc patients. Notably, IFN-α/β-treated human endothelial cells show 8-10-fold increased ADAR1p150 and 23-35-fold increased CTSS expression, while silencing of ADAR1 reduces CTSS expression by 60-70%. In SSc patients, increased RNA editing rate of individual adenosines located in CTSS 3' UTR Alu elements is associated with higher CTSS expression (r = 0.36-0.6, P < 0.05 for all). Similar findings were obtained in subjects with activated type I IFN responses including SLE patients or healthy subjects after influenza vaccination.

34190025,An integrated DNA and RNA variant detector identifies a highly conserved three base exon in the MAP4K5 kinase locus.,"RNA variants that emerge from editing and alternative splicing form important regulatory stages in protein signalling. In this report, we apply an integrated DNA and RNA variant detection workbench to define the range of RNA variants that deviate from the reference genome in a human melanoma cell model. The RNA variants can be grouped into (i) classic ADAR-like or APOBEC-like RNA editing events and (ii) multiple-nucleotide variants (MNVs) including three and six base pair in-frame non-canonical unmapped exons. We focus on validating representative genes of these classes. First, clustered non-synonymous RNA edits (A-I) in the CDK13 gene were validated by Sanger sequencing to confirm the integrity of the RNA variant detection workbench. Second, a highly conserved RNA variant in the MAP4K5 gene was detected that results most likely from the splicing of a non-canonical three-base exon. The two RNA variants produced from the MAP4K5 locus deviate from the genomic reference sequence and produce V569E or V569del isoform variants. Low doses of splicing inhibitors demonstrated that the MAP4K5-V569E variant emerges from an SF3B1-dependent splicing event. Mass spectrometry of the recombinant SBP-tagged MAP4K5(V569E) and MAP4K5(V569del) proteins pull-downs in transfected cell systems was used to identify the protein-protein interactions of these two MAP4K5 isoforms and propose possible functions.

The development of limbs has been the milestone in vertebrate evolution. Several limb and bone-related genes were verified experimentally, but other indirect and regulatory factors of limb development remained untested, especially very few cases were observed in natural environment. We report a naturally born serpentized pig without hindlimbs. Whole genome sequencing followed by comparative genomic analysis revealed multiple interesting patterns on the handicapped pig-specific mutations. Although the bone-related genes are not directly subjected to mutations, other regulatory factors such as the RNA deaminase genes Adar are damaged in the handicapped pig, leading to the abolished A-to-I deamination in many functional, conserved genes as well as the bone-related genes. This is a precious case that the limbless phenotype is observed in naturally born non-model organisms.

Editing is dysregulated in neuropsychiatric diseases, but has not yet been investigated at scale at the level of individual neurons. We quantified RNA editing sites in nuclear transcriptomes of 3055 neurons from six cortical regions of a neurotypical female donor, and found 41,930 sites present in at least ten nuclei. Most sites were located within Alu repeats in introns or 3' UTRs, and approximately 80% were cataloged in public RNA editing databases. We identified 9285 putative novel editing sites, 29% of which were also detectable in unrelated donors. Intersection with results from bulk RNA-seq studies provided cell-type and spatial context for 1730 sites that are differentially edited in schizophrenic brain donors, and 910 such sites in autistic donors. Autism-related genes were also enriched with editing sites predicted to modify RNA structure. Inhibitory neurons showed higher overall transcriptome editing than excitatory neurons, and the highest editing rates were observed in the frontal cortex. We used generalized linear models to identify differentially edited sites and genes between cell types. Twenty nine genes were preferentially edited in excitatory neurons, and 43 genes were edited more heavily in inhibitory neurons, including RBFOX1, its target genes, and genes in the autism-associated Prader-Willi locus (15q11). The abundance of SNORD115/116 genes from locus 15q11 was positively associated with editing activity across the transcriptome.

By doing so, it alters protein-coding sequences, resulting in novel protein products that diversify the proteome beyond its genomic blueprint. Recoding is exceptionally abundant in the neural tissues of coleoid cephalopods (octopuses, squids, and cuttlefishes), with an over-representation of nonsynonymous edits suggesting positive selection. However, the extent to which proteome diversification by recoding provides an adaptive advantage is not known. It was recently suggested that the role of evolutionarily conserved edits is to compensate for harmful genomic substitutions, and that there is no added value in having an editable codon as compared with a restoration of the preferred genomic allele. Here, we show that this hypothesis fails to explain the evolutionary dynamics of recoding sites in coleoids. Instead, our results indicate that a large fraction of the shared, strongly recoded, sites in coleoids have been selected for proteome diversification, meaning that the fitness of an editable A is higher than an uneditable A or a genomically encoded G.",2021 Aug 23,Mol Biol Evol. 2021 Aug 23;38(9):3775-3788. doi: 10.1093/molbev/msab154.,"['Shoshan Y', 'Liscovitch-Brauer N', 'Rosenthal JJC', 'Eisenberg E']",True
34380502,"Developing PspCas13b-based enhanced RESCUE system, eRESCUE, with efficient RNA base editing.","RNA base editing is potential for cellular function research and genetic diseases treating. There are two main RNA base editors, REPAIR and RESCUE, for in vitro use. REPAIR was developed by fusing inactivated Cas13 (dCas13) with the adenine deaminase domain of ADAR2, which efficiently performs adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing. RESCUE, which performs both cytidine-to-uridine (C-to-U) and A-to-I RNA editing, was developed by fusing inactivated Cas13 (dCas13) with the evolved ADAR2. However, the relatively low editing efficiency of the RESCUE system limits its broad application. Here, we constructed an enhanced RESCUE (eRESCUE) system; this dPspCas13b-RESCUE-NES system was generated by fusing inactivated PspCas13b with the evolved ADAR2. We determined the endogenous mRNA A-to-I and C-to-U editing efficiency mediated by the dPspCas13b-RESCUE-NES system in HEK-293T cells. This new RNA base editor was then used to induce 177Ser/Gly conversion of inhibitor kappa B kinase β (IKKβ) by changing the genetic code from AGU to GGU. The results showed that the eRESCUE editor mediates more efficient A-to-I and C-to-U RNA editing than the RESCUE RNA editor, as was previously reported. The 177Ser/Gly conversion of IKKβ, accomplished by converting the genetic code from AGU to GGU, resulted in a decrease in the phosphorylation of IKKβ and downregulation of downstream IKKβ-related genes. In summary, we developed a more efficient RNA base editor, eRESCUE, which may provide a useful tool for biomedical research and genetic disease treatment.

34192517,Vaccinia virus E3 prevents sensing of Z-RNA to block ZBP1-dependent necroptosis.,"Necroptosis mediated by Z-nucleic-acid-binding protein (ZBP)1 (also called DAI or DLM1) contributes to innate host defense against viruses by triggering cell death to eliminate infected cells. During infection, vaccinia virus (VACV) protein E3 prevents death signaling by competing for Z-form RNA through an N-terminal Zα domain. In the absence of this E3 domain, Z-form RNA accumulates during the early phase of VACV infection, triggering ZBP1 to recruit receptor interacting protein kinase (RIPK)3 and execute necroptosis. The C-terminal E3 double-strand RNA-binding domain must be retained to observe accumulation of Z-form RNA and induction of necroptosis.

34380029,ADAR1 interaction with Z-RNA promotes editing of endogenous double-stranded RNA and prevents MDA5-dependent immune activation.,Loss of function of adenosine deaminase acting on double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-1 (ADAR1) causes the severe autoinflammatory disease Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS). ADAR1 converts adenosines into inosines within dsRNA. This process called A-to-I editing masks self-dsRNA from detection by the antiviral dsRNA sensor MDA5. ADAR1 binds to dsRNA in both the canonical A-form and the poorly defined Z conformation (Z-RNA). Mutations in the Z-RNA-binding Zα domain of ADAR1 are common in patients with AGS. How loss of ADAR1/Z-RNA interaction contributes to disease development is unknown. We demonstrate that abrogated binding of ADAR1 to Z-RNA leads to reduced A-to-I editing of dsRNA structures formed by base pairing of inversely oriented short interspersed nuclear elements. Preventing ADAR1 binding to Z-RNA triggers an MDA5/MAVS-mediated type I interferon response and leads to the development of lethal autoinflammation in mice. This shows that the interaction between ADAR1 and Z-RNA restricts sensing of self-dsRNA and prevents AGS development.,2021 Aug 10,Cell Rep. 2021 Aug 10;36(6):109500. doi: 10.1016/j.celrep.2021.109500.,"['de Reuver R', 'Dierick E', 'Wiernicki B', 'Staes K', 'Seys L', 'De Meester E', 'Muyldermans T', 'Botzki A', 'Lambrecht BN', 'Van Nieuwerburgh F', 'Vandenabeele P', 'Maelfait J']",False
34253859,Hepatitis B virus evades immune recognition via RNA adenosine deaminase ADAR1-mediated viral RNA editing in hepatocytes.,"HBV is considered as a ""stealth"" virus that does not invoke interferon (IFN) responses; however, the mechanisms by which HBV bypasses innate immune recognition are poorly understood. In this study, we identified adenosine deaminases acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1), which is a key factor in HBV evasion from IFN responses in hepatocytes. Mechanically, ADAR1 interacted with HBV RNAs and deaminated adenosine (A) to generate inosine (I), which disrupted host immune recognition and thus promoted HBV replication. Loss of ADAR1 or its deficient deaminase activity promoted IFN responses and inhibited HBV replication in hepatocytes, and blocking the IFN signaling pathways released the inhibition of HBV replication caused by ADAR1 deficiency. Notably, the HBV X protein (HBx) transcriptionally promoted ADAR1 expression to increase the threshold required to trigger intrinsic immune activation, which in turn enhanced HBV escape from immune recognition, leading to persistent infection. Supplementation with 8-azaadenosine, an ADAR1 inhibitor, efficiently enhanced liver immune activation to promote HBV clearance in vivo and in vitro. Taken together, our results delineate a molecular mechanism by which HBx promotes ADAR1-derived HBV immune escape and suggest a targeted therapeutic intervention for HBV infection.",2021 Aug,Cell Mol Immunol. 2021 Aug;18(8):1871-1882. doi: 10.1038/s41423-021-00729-1.

34308324,Human hepatitis D virus-specific T cell epitopes.,"HDV is a small, defective RNA virus that requires the HBsAg of HBV for its assembly, release, and transmission. Chronic HBV/HDV infection often has a severe clinical outcome and is difficult to treat. The important role of a robust virus-specific T cell response for natural viral control has been established for many other chronic viral infections, but the exact role of the T cell response in the control and progression of chronic HDV infection is far less clear. Several recent studies have characterised HDV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses on a peptide level. This review comprehensively summarises all HDV-specific T cell epitopes described to date and describes our current knowledge of the role of T cells in HDV infection. While we now have better tools to study the adaptive anti-HDV-specific T cell response, further efforts are needed to define the HLA restriction of additional HDV-specific T cell epitopes, establish additional HDV-specific MHC tetramers, understand the degree of cross HDV genotype reactivity of individual epitopes and understand the correlation of the HBV- and HDV-specific T cell response, as well as the breadth and specificity of the intrahepatic HDV-specific T cell response.",2021 Aug,JHEP Rep. 2021 Apr 23;3(4):100294. doi: 10.1016/j.jhepr.2021.100294. eCollection 2021 Aug.,"['Kohsar M', 'Landahl J', 'Neumann-Haefelin C', 'Schulze Zur Wiesch J']",False
34081786,Proline-arginine poly-dipeptide encoded by the C9orf72 repeat expansion inhibits adenosine deaminase acting on RNA.,"A GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the C9orf72 gene is linked to the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) (C9-ALS/FTD). Unconventional translation of the hexanucleotide repeat expansion generates five dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs). The molecular mechanism underlying the DPR-linked neurotoxicity is under investigation. In this study, using cell-based models, we show that poly-proline-arginine DPR (poly-PR), the most neurotoxic DPR in vitro, binds to adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR)1p110 and ADAR2 and inhibits their RNA editing activity. We further show that poly-PR impairs cellular stress response that is mediated by ADAR1p110. These results together suggest that the poly-PR-mediated inhibition of the ADAR activity contributes to C9-ALS/FTD-linked neurotoxicity.",2021 Aug,J Neurochem. 2021 Aug;158(3):753-765. doi: 10.1111/jnc.15445.

By employing next-generation sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification of tumour samples from 26 patients, we identified somatic alterations in paediatric PTCL including Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-negative (EBV(-) ) and EBV-positive (EBV(+) ) patients. As recurrent mutational targets for PTCL, we identified several previously unreported genes, including TNS1, ZFHX3, LRP2, NCOA2 and HOXA1, as well as genes previously reported in adult patients, e.g. TET2, CDKN2A, STAT3 and TP53. However, for other reported mutations, VAV1-related abnormalities were absent and mutations of NRAS, GATA3 and JAK3 showed a low frequency in our cohort. Concerning the association of EBV infection, two novel fusion genes: STAG2-AFF2 and ITPR2-FSTL4, and deletion and alteration of CDKN2A/2B, LMO1 and HOXA1 were identified in EBV(-) PTCL, but not in EBV(+) PTCL. Conversely, alterations of PCDHGA4, ADAR, CUL9 and TP53 were identified only in EBV(+) PTCL.

33916692,Detecting and Characterizing A-To-I microRNA Editing in Cancer.,"Adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) editing consists of an RNA modification where single adenosines along the RNA sequence are converted into inosines. Such a biochemical transformation is catalyzed by enzymes belonging to the family of adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) and occurs either co- or post-transcriptionally. The employment of powerful, high-throughput detection methods has recently revealed that A-to-I editing widely occurs in non-coding RNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs). MiRNAs are a class of small regulatory non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) acting as translation inhibitors, known to exert relevant roles in controlling cell cycle, proliferation, and cancer development. Indeed, a growing number of recent researches have evidenced the importance of miRNA editing in cancer biology by exploiting various detection and validation methods. Herein, we briefly overview early and currently available A-to-I miRNA editing detection and validation methods and discuss the significance of A-to-I miRNA editing in human cancer.",2021 Apr 3,Cancers (Basel). 2021 Apr 3;13(7):1699. doi: 10.3390/cancers13071699.,"['Marceca GP', 'Tomasello L', 'Distefano R', 'Acunzo M', 'Croce CM', 'Nigita G']",False
33911136,PKR activity modulation by phosphomimetic mutations of serine residues located three aminoacids upstream of double-stranded RNA binding motifs.,"Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase 2 (EIF2AK2), better known as PKR, plays a key role in the response to viral infections and cellular homeostasis by regulating mRNA translation. Upon binding dsRNA, PKR is activated through homodimerization and subsequent autophosphorylation on residues Thr446 and Thr451. In this study, we identified a novel PKR phosphorylation site, Ser6, located 3 amino acids upstream of the first double-stranded RNA binding motif (DRBM1). Another Ser residue occurs in PKR at position 97, the very same position relative to the DRBM2. Ser or Thr residues also occur 3 amino acids upstream DRBMs of other proteins such as ADAR1 or DICER. Phosphoinhibiting mutations (Ser-to-Ala) introduced at Ser6 and Ser97 spontaneously activated PKR. In contrast, phosphomimetic mutations (Ser-to-Asp) inhibited PKR activation following either poly (I:C) transfection or virus infection. These mutations moderately affected dsRNA binding or dimerization, suggesting a model where negative charges occurring at position 6 and 97 tighten the interaction of DRBMs with the kinase domain, thus keeping PKR in an inactive closed conformation even in the presence of dsRNA. This study provides new insights on PKR regulation mechanisms and identifies Ser6 and Ser97 as potential targets to modulate PKR activity for therapeutic purposes.",2021 Apr 28,Sci Rep. 2021 Apr 28;11(1):9188. doi: 10.1038/s41598-021-88610-z.,"['Cesaro T', 'Hayashi Y', 'Borghese F', 'Vertommen D', 'Wavreil F', 'Michiels T']",False

ADAR-mediated RNA editing modulates cellular pathways involved in innate immunity, RNA splicing, RNA interference, and protein recoding, and has been investigated as a strategy for therapeutic intervention of genetic disorders. Despite advances in basic and translational research, the mechanisms regulating RNA editing are poorly understood. Though several trans-acting regulators of editing have been shown to modulate ADAR protein expression, previous studies have not identified factors that modulate ADAR catalytic activity. Here, we show that RNA editing increases upon intracellular acidification, and that these effects are predominantly explained by both enhanced ADAR base-flipping and deamination rate at acidic pH. We also show that the extent of RNA editing increases with the reduction in pH associated with conditions of cellular hypoxia.",2021 Apr 19,Nucleic Acids Res. 2021 Apr 19;49(7):4020-4036. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkab157.,"['Malik TN', 'Doherty EE', 'Gaded VM', 'Hill TM', 'Beal PA', 'Emeson RB']",True

One form of Aicardi-Goutières syndrome caused by inactivating mutations in ADAR results in reduced adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing of endogenous dsRNAs, induction of IFNs, IFN-stimulated genes, other inflammatory mediators, morbidity, and mortality. Alu elements, ∼10% of the human genome, are the most common A-to-I-editing sites. Using leukocyte whole-genome RNA-sequencing data, we found reduced A-to-I editing of Alu dsRNAs in patients with severe COVID-19 disease. Dendritic cells infected with COVID-19 also exhibit reduced A-to-I editing of Alu dsRNAs. Unedited Alu dsRNAs, but not edited Alu dsRNAs, are potent inducers of IRF and NF-κB transcriptional responses, IL6, IL8, and IFN-stimulated genes. Thus, decreased A-to-I editing that may lead to accumulation of unedited Alu dsRNAs and increased inflammatory responses is associated with severe COVID-19 disease.",2021 Apr 15,J Immunol. 2021 Apr 15;206(8):1691-1696. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.2001428.

33853558,Humanized anti-DEspR IgG4(S228P) antibody increases overall survival in a pancreatic cancer stem cell-xenograft peritoneal carcinomatosis rat(nu/nu) model.,"BACKGROUND: Pancreatic peritoneal carcinomatosis (PPC), with the worst median overall-survival (mOS), epitomizes the incurability of metastatic cancer. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) underpin this incurability. However, inhibitors of CSC-stemness fail to increase mOS in cancer patients despite preclinical tumor-reduction. This shortfall reinforces that preclinical efficacy should be defined by increased mOS in the presence of cancer comorbidities, CSC-heterogeneity and plasticity. The primary objectives of this study are: to test the dual endothelin-1/signal peptide receptor, DEspR, as a nodal therapeutic target in PPC, given DEspR induction in anoikis-resistant pancreatic CSCs, and to validate humanized anti-DEspR antibody, hu-6g8, as a potential therapeutic for PPC. METHODS: We used heterogeneous pools of CSCs selected for anoikis resistance from reprogrammed Panc1 and MiaPaCa2 tumor cells (TCs), and adherent TCs reprogrammed from CSCs (cscTCs). We used multiple anti-DEspR blocking antibodies (mAbs) with different epitopes, and a humanized anti-DEspR recombinant mAb cross-reactive in rodents and humans, to test DEspR inhibition effects. We measured DEspR-inhibition efficacy on multiple prometastatic CSC-functions in vitro, and on tumorigenesis and overall survival in a CSC-derived xenograft (CDX) nude rat model of PPC with comorbidities. RESULTS: Here we show that DEspR, a stress-survival receptor, is present on subsets of PDAC Panc1-TCs, TC-derived CSCs, and CSC-differentiated TCs (cscTCs), and that DESpR-inhibition decreases apoptosis-resistance and pro-metastatic mesenchymal functions of CSCs and cscTCs in vitro. We resolve the DNA-sequence/protein-function discordance by confirming ADAR1-RNA editing-dependent DEspR-protein expression in Panc1 and MiaPaCa2 TCs. To advance DEspR-inhibition as a nodal therapeutic approach for PPC, we developed and show improved functionality of a recombinant, humanized anti-DEspR IgG4(S228P) antibody, hu-6g8, over murine precursor anti-DEspR mabs. Hu-6g8 internalizes and translocates to the nucleus colocalized with cyto-nuclear shuttling galectins-1/3, and induces apoptotic cell changes. DEspR-inhibition blocks transperitoneal dissemination and progression to peritoneal carcinomatosis of heterogeneous DEspR±/CD133 ± Panc1-derived CSCs in xenografted nude rats, improving mOS without chemotherapy-like adverse effects. Lastly, we show DEspR expression in Stage II-IV primary and invasive TCs in the stroma in PDAC-patient tumor arrays. CONCLUSION: Collectively, the data support humanized anti-DEspR hu-6g8 as a potential targeted antibody-therapeutic with promising efficacy, safety and prevalence profiles for PPC patients.",2021 Apr 14,BMC Cancer. 2021 Apr 14;21(1):407. doi: 10.1186/s12885-021-08107-w.,"['Gromisch CM', 'Tan GLA', 'Pasion KA', 'Moran AM', 'Gromisch MS', 'Grinstaff MW', 'Carr FJ', 'Herrera VLM', 'Ruiz-Opazo N']",False

The aim of this study is to evaluate the utility of a panel of 142 mutation-signature-associated metrics (P142) for predicting cancer progression in patients from a 'TCGA PanCancer Atlas' cohort. The P142 metrics are comprised of AID/APOBEC and ADAR deaminase associated SNVs analyzed for codon context, strand bias, and transitions/transversions. TCGA tumor-normal mutation data was obtained for 10,437 patients, representing 31 of the most prevalent forms of cancer. Stratified random sampling was used to split patients into training, tuning and validation cohorts for each cancer type. Cancer specific machine learning (XGBoost) models were built using the output from the P142 panel to predict patient Progression Free Survival (PFS) status as either ""High PFS"" or ""Low PFS"". Predictive performance of each model was evaluated using the validation cohort. Models accurately predicted PFS status for several cancer types, including adrenocortical carcinoma, glioma, mesothelioma, and sarcoma. In conclusion, the P142 panel of metrics successfully predicted cancer progression status in patients with some, but not all cancer types analyzed.

We apply a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated saturation mutagenesis approach to generate libraries of mutations near three natural editing substrates at their endogenous genomic loci. We use machine learning to integrate diverse RNA sequence and structure features to model editing levels measured by deep sequencing. We confirm known features and identify new features important for RNA editing. Training and testing XGBoost algorithm within the same substrate yield models that explain 68 to 86 percent of substrate-specific variation in editing levels.

Hence, in addition to somatic mutations and alternative RNA splicing, RNA editing can be a further source for recoding events. Although RNA editing has been detected in many solid cancers and normal tissue, RNA editing in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) has not been addressed so far. We determined global RNA editing and recurrent, recoding RNA editing events from matched RNA-sequencing and whole exome sequencing data in CLL samples from 45 untreated patients. RNA editing was verified in a validation cohort of 98 CLL patients and revealed substantially altered RNA editing profiles in CLL compared with normal B cells. We further found that RNA editing patterns were prognostically relevant. Finally, we showed that ADAR knockout decreased steady state viability of MEC1 cells and made them more susceptible to treatment with fludarabine and ibrutinib in vitro.

Adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing, the most frequent nucleotide conversion on RNA, which is catalyzed by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) enzymes, may modulate gene expression and function. Here, we investigated the potential regulation of human PXR expression by adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing. Knockdown of ADAR1 increased PXR mRNA level, and the knockdown of ADAR1 or ADAR2 significantly increased PXR protein level in HepaRG cells. In HepG2 cells, the knockdown of ADAR1 or ADAR2 significantly increased PXR mRNA and protein levels. The increase in the PXR protein by ADAR1 knockdown resulted in increased cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) transactivity and CYP3A4 and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) expression. A reporter assay revealed that the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of PXR mRNA, especially from +3371 to +3440, is responsible for the ADAR-mediated post-transcriptional control of PXR expression, despite the lack of RNA edited sites in this region.

33768008,Mechanisms of Action of Hypomethylating Agents: Endogenous Retroelements at the Epicenter.,"Abnormal DNA methylation patterns are thought to drive the pathobiology of high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (HR-MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Sixteen years after their initial approval, the hypomethylating agents (HMAs), 5-azacytidine (AZA) and 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, remain the mainstay of treatment for HR-MDS and AML. However, a connection of the hypomethylating or additional effects of HMAs with clinical responses remains yet to be shown, and the mode of action of HMAs remains obscure. Given the relatively short-lived responses and the inevitable development of resistance in HMAs, a thorough understanding of the antineoplastic mechanisms employed by HMAs holds critical importance. Recent data in cancer cell lines demonstrate that reactivation of endogenous retroelements (EREs) and induction of a cell-intrinsic antiviral response triggered by RNA neotranscripts may underlie the antitumor activity of HMAs. However, data on primary CD34(+) cells derived from patients with HR-MDS failed to confirm a link between HMA-mediated ERE modulation and clinical response. Though difficult to reconcile the apparent discrepancy, it is possible that HMAs mediate their effects in more advanced levels of differentiation where cells become responsive to interferon, whereas, inter-individual variations in the process of RNA editing and, in particular, in the ADAR1/OAS/RNase L pathway may also confound the associations of clinical response with the induction of viral mimicry. Further ex vivo studies along with clinical correlations in well-annotated patient cohorts are warranted to decipher the role of ERE derepression in the antineoplastic mechanisms of HMAs.",2021,Front Oncol. 2021 Mar 9;11:650473. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2021.650473. eCollection 2021.,"['Kordella C', 'Lamprianidou E', 'Kotsianidis I']",False

Recent studies have suggested a role for oxidized RNA in several human disorders. Under the conditions of oxidative stress, mRNAs released from polysome dissociation accumulate and initiate stress granule (SG) assembly. SGs are highly enriched in mRNAs, containing inverted repeat (IR) Alus in 3' UTRs, AU-rich elements, and RNA-binding proteins.

However, the types of RNA species exchanged, and the mechanisms and outcomes of exchange are still unknown. Specialized RNA-binding proteins, including adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR1-p150), with an affinity toward inverted repeat Alus, and Tudor staphylococcal nuclease (Tudor-SN) are specifically recruited to SGs under OS along with an RNA transport protein, Staufen1 (STAU1), but their precise biochemical roles in SGs and SG/P-body docking are uncertain.

We describe herein the clinical picture and treatment response to the JAK-inhibitor ruxolitinib in a 5-year-old girl affected by Aicardi-Goutières Syndrome type 6 (AGS6) due to ADAR1 mutation. The girl's interferon score (IS) was compared with that of her older brother, suffering from the same disorder, who was not treated. We observed a limited, but distinct neurological improvement (Gross Motor Function and Griffiths Mental Development Scales). Analysis of IS values of the two siblings during the treatment showed several changes, especially related to infections; the IS values of the child treated with ruxolitinib were consistently lower than those measured in her brother. Based on these observations we suggest that the use of ruxolitinib in children with the same condition might be effective in inhibiting type I interferon response and that starting this therapy at early age in children with AGS could mitigate the detrimental effects of type I interferon hyperproduction.",2021,Front Pediatr. 2021 Oct 27;9:725868. doi: 10.3389/fped.2021.725868. eCollection 2021.,"['Cattalini M', 'Galli J', 'Zunica F', 'Ferraro RM', 'Carpanelli M', 'Orcesi S', 'Palumbo G', 'Pinelli L', 'Giliani S', 'Fazzi E', 'Badolato R']",True

Here, this study observed the function and regulatory mechanism of ADAR1 in peritoneal metastasis of gastric cancer. Methods: ADAR1, CALR and β-catenin proteins were detected in normal mucosa, primary gastric cancer, metastatic lymph node and metastatic omentum tissues by immunohistochemistry, western blot, and immunofluorescence. After silencing ADAR1 by siADAR1, the effect and mechanism of ADAR1 on gastric cancer metastasis were observed in nude mouse models of gastric cancer with peritoneal metastasis as well as HGC-27 and AGS gastric cancer cells. Result: Our results showed that ADAR1 was significantly up-regulated in gastric cancer, metastatic lymph node and metastatic omentum tissues. Its up-regulation was significantly correlated to lymph node metastasis and peritoneal metastasis. Silencing ADAR1 significantly reduced the volume of peritoneal metastatic tumors and weakened oncogene CALR expression, Wnt / β-catenin pathway and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process in vivo. Furthermore, ADAR1 knockdown distinctly suppressed cell viability, colony formation and migration of HGC-27 and AGS cells and ameliorated the effects of Wnt pathway activator on tumor progression. The similar findings were investigated when treated with ADAR1 inhibitor 8-Azaadenosine.

32729076,Adenosine-to-Inosine RNA Editing Enzyme ADAR and microRNAs.,"RNA is subjected to over 100 different types of chemical modifications inside the cell. These modifications have various effects on its function and expression, resulting in RNA diversity. RNA editing or conversion of adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) in a double-stranded RNA is a type of RNA modification that can introduce mutations into the precursor of microRNA (miRNA). It can also regulate miRNA processing independently of A-to-I RNA editing.

32729079,ALU A-to-I RNA Editing: Millions of Sites and Many Open Questions.,"Alu elements are repetitive short interspersed elements prevalent in the primate genome. These repeats account for over 10% of the genome with more than a million highly similar copies. A direct outcome of this is an enrichment in long structures of stable dsRNA, which are the target of adenosine deaminases acting on RNAs (ADARs), the enzymes catalyzing A-to-I RNA editing. Indeed, A-to-I editing by ADARs is extremely abundant in primates: over a hundred million editing sites exist in their genomes. However, despite the radical increase in ADAR targets brought on by the introduction of Alu elements, the few evolutionary conserved editing sites manage to retain their editing levels. Here, we review and discuss the cost of having an unusual amount of dsRNA and editing in the transcriptome, as well as the opportunities it presents, which possibly contributed to accelerating primate evolution.",2021,Methods Mol Biol. 2021;2181:149-162. doi: 10.1007/978-1-0716-0787-9_9.,"['Schaffer AA', 'Levanon EY']",True
32729080,RNA Editing in Human and Mouse Tissues.,"Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing is a fundamental posttranscriptional mechanism that greatly diversifies the transcriptome in many living organisms, including mammals. Multiple studies have demonstrated the importance of this process not just in normal development and physiology but also in various human diseases. Importantly, the precise editing level of a site may have downstream consequences on cellular behavior. Hence, the editing levels should be quantified as accurately as possible. In this chapter, we describe how to examine RNA editing in human and mouse tissues. The rapid development of next-generation sequencing technologies is affording us an unprecedented ability to accurately measure the editing levels of numerous sites simultaneously. Our experimental workflow includes the harvesting of high-quality RNA samples and the construction of different high-throughput sequencing libraries.

However, areas with heavily edited reads produce dense clusters of A-to-G mismatches that hinder alignment, and complicate correct identification of the sites. The presented approach employs prudent alignment and examination of excessive mismatch events, enabling high-accuracy detection of hyper-edited reads and sites.",2021,Methods Mol Biol. 2021;2181:213-227. doi: 10.1007/978-1-0716-0787-9_13.,"['Cohen-Fultheim R', 'Levanon EY']",True
32729084,Proteome Diversification by RNA Editing.,"RNA editing is an RNA modification that alters the RNA sequence relative to its genomic blueprint. The most common type of RNA editing is A-to-I editing by double-stranded RNA-specific adenosine deaminase (ADAR) enzymes. Editing of a protein-coding region within the RNA molecule may result in non-synonymous substitutions, leading to a modified protein product. These editing sites, also known as ""recoding"" sites, contribute to the complexity and diversification of the proteome. Recent computational transcriptomic studies have identified thousands of recoding sites in multiple species, many of which are conserved within (but not usually across) lineages and have functional and evolutionary importance.

To avoid self-RNA recognition, the innate immune sensors have evolved sophisticated discriminatory mechanisms that involve cellular RNA metabolic machineries. Posttranscriptional RNA modification and editing represent one such mechanism that allows cells to chemically tag the host RNAs as ""self"" and thus tolerate the abundant self-RNA molecules.

Due to its different mode of action RNA editing may well complement gene editing and other gene therapy options. In this method chapter, we particularly highlight RNA editing strategies that harness endogenous ADARs. Such strategies circumvent the delivery and expression of engineered editases and are notably precise and simple. This is particularly true if endogenous ADARs are recruited with chemically modified antisense oligonucleotides, an approach we call RESTORE (recruiting endogenous ADAR to specific transcripts for oligonucleotide-mediated RNA editing). To foster the research and development of RESTORE we now report a detailed protocol for the procedure of editing reactions, and a protocol for the generation of partly chemically modified RESTORE ASOs with a combination of in vitro transcription and ligation.",2021,Methods Mol Biol. 2021;2181:331-349. doi: 10.1007/978-1-0716-0787-9_19.,"['Merkle T', 'Stafforst T']",True
35265942,Mechanisms Underlying the Anti-Suicidal Treatment Potential of Buprenorphine.,"Death by suicide is a global epidemic with over 800 K suicidal deaths worlwide in 2012. Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death among Americans and more than 44 K people died by suicide in 2019 in the United States. Patients with chronic pain, including, but not limited to, those with substance use disorders, are particularly vulnerable. Chronic pain patients have twice the risk of death by suicide compared to those without pain, and 50% of chronic pain patients report that they have considered suicide at some point due to their pain. The kappa opioid system is implicated in negative mood states including dysphoria, depression, and anxiety, and recent evidence shows that chronic pain increases the function of this system in limbic brain regions important for affect and motivation. Additionally, dynorphin, the endogenous ligand that activates the kappa opioid receptor is increased in the caudate putamen of human suicide victims. A potential treatment for reducing suicidal ideation and suicidal attempts is buprenorphine. Buprenorphine, a partial mu opioid agonist with kappa opioid antagonist properties, reduced suicidal ideation in chronic pain patients with and without an opioid use disorder. This review will highlight the clinical and preclinical evidence to support the use of buprenorphine in mitigating pain-induced negative affective states and suicidal thoughts, where these effects are at least partially mediated via its kappa antagonist properties.",2021,Adv Drug Alcohol Res. 2021;1:10009. doi: 10.3389/adar.2021.10009.

33679890,Comprehensive Analysis of Cell Population Dynamics and Related Core Genes During Vitiligo Development.,"Vitiligo is a common immune-related depigmentation condition, and its pathogenesis remains unclear. This study used a combination of bioinformatics methods and expression analysis techniques to explore the relationship between immune cell infiltration and gene expression in vitiligo. Previously reported gene expression microarray data from the skin (GSE53146 and GSE75819) and peripheral blood (GSE80009 and GSE90880) of vitiligo patients and healthy controls was used in the analysis. R software was used to filter the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in each dataset, and the KOBAS 2.0 server was used to perform functional enrichment analysis. Compared with healthy controls, the upregulated genes in skin lesions and peripheral blood leukocytes of vitiligo patents were highly enriched in immune response pathways and inflammatory response signaling pathways. Immunedeconv software and the EPIC method were used to analyze the expression levels of marker genes to obtain the immune cell population in the samples. In the lesional skin of vitiligo patients, the proportions of macrophages, B cells and NK cells were increased compared with healthy controls. In the peripheral blood of vitiligo patients, CD8+ T cells and macrophages were significantly increased. A coexpression analysis of the cell populations and DEGs showed that differentially expressed immune and inflammation response genes had a strong positive correlation with macrophages. The TLR4 receptor pathway, interferon gamma-mediated signaling pathway and lipopolysaccharide-related pathway were positively correlated with CD4+ T cells. Regarding immune response-related genes, the overexpression of IFITM2, TNFSF10, GZMA, ADAMDEC1, NCF2, ADAR, SIGLEC16, and WIPF2 were related to macrophage abundance, while the overexpression of ICOS, GPR183, RGS1, ILF2 and CD28 were related to CD4+ T cell abundance. GZMA and CXCL10 expression were associated with CD8+ T cell abundance. Regarding inflammatory response-related genes, the overexpression of CEBPB, ADAM8, CXCR3, and TNIP3 promoted macrophage infiltration. Only ADORA1 expression was associated with CD4+ T cell infiltration. ADAM8 and CXCL10 expression were associated with CD8+ T cell abundance. The overexpression of CCL18, CXCL10, FOS, NLRC4, LY96, HCK, MYD88, and KLRG1, which are related to inflammation and immune responses, were associated with macrophage abundance. We also found that immune cells infiltration in vitiligo was associated with antigen presentation-related genes expression.

33969287,Reduced A-to-I editing of endogenous Alu RNAs in lung after SARS-CoV-2 infection.,"Due to potential severity of disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, it is critical to understand both mechanisms of viral pathogenesis as well as diversity of host responses to infection. Reduced A-to-I editing of endogenous double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs), as a result of inactivating mutations in ADAR, produces one form of Aicardi-Goutières Syndrome, with an immune response similar to an anti-viral response. By analyzing whole genome RNA sequencing data, we find reduced levels of A-to-I editing of endogenous Alu RNAs in normal human lung cells after infection by SARS-CoV-2 as well as in lung biopsies from patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections. Unedited Alu RNAs, as seen after infection, induce IRF and NF-kB transcriptional responses and downstream target genes, while edited Alu RNAs as seen in the absence of infection, fail to activate these transcriptional responses. Thus, decreased A-to-I editing may represent an important host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.",2021,Curr Res Immunol. 2021;2:52-59. doi: 10.1016/j.crimmu.2021.04.001.

34135887,Evolutionary Comparative Analyses of DNA-Editing Enzymes of the Immune System: From 5-Dimensional Description of Protein Structures to Immunological Insights and Applications to Protein Engineering.,"The immune system is unique among all biological sub-systems in its usage of DNA-editing enzymes to introduce targeted gene mutations and double-strand DNA breaks to diversify antigen receptor genes and combat viral infections. These processes, initiated by specific DNA-editing enzymes, often result in mistargeted induction of genome lesions that initiate and drive cancers. Like other molecules involved in human health and disease, the DNA-editing enzymes of the immune system have been intensively studied in humans and mice, with little attention paid (< 1% of published studies) to the same enzymes in evolutionarily distant species. Here, we present a systematic review of the literature on the characterization of one such DNA-editing enzyme, activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), from an evolutionary comparative perspective. The central thesis of this review is that although the evolutionary comparative approach represents a minuscule fraction of published works on this and other DNA-editing enzymes, this approach has made significant impacts across the fields of structural biology, immunology, and cancer research. Using AID as an example, we highlight the value of the evolutionary comparative approach in discoveries already made, and in the context of emerging directions in immunology and protein engineering. We introduce the concept of 5-dimensional (5D) description of protein structures, a more nuanced view of a structure that is made possible by evolutionary comparative studies. In this higher dimensional view of a protein's structure, the classical 3-dimensional (3D) structure is integrated in the context of real-time conformations and evolutionary time shifts (4(th) dimension) and the relevance of these dynamics to its biological function (5(th) dimension).",2021,Front Immunol. 2021 May 31;12:642343. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2021.642343. eCollection 2021.,"['Ghorbani A', 'Quinlan EM', 'Larijani M']",False
34367244,RESIC: A Tool for Comprehensive Adenosine to Inosine RNA Editing Site Identification and Classification.,"Adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing, the most prevalent type of RNA editing in metazoans, is carried out by adenosine deaminases (ADARs) in double-stranded RNA regions. Several computational approaches have been recently developed to identify A-to-I RNA editing sites from sequencing data, each addressing a particular issue. Here, we present RNA Editing Sites Identification and Classification (RESIC), an efficient pipeline that combines several approaches for the detection and classification of RNA editing sites. The pipeline can be used for all organisms and can use any number of RNA-sequencing datasets as input. RESIC provides (1) the detection of editing sites in both repetitive and non-repetitive genomic regions; (2) the identification of hyper-edited regions; and (3) optional exclusion of polymorphism sites to increase reliability, based on DNA, and ADAR-mutant RNA sequencing datasets, or SNP databases. We demonstrate the utility of RESIC by applying it to human, successfully overlapping and extending the list of known putative editing sites. We further tested changes in the patterns of A-to-I RNA editing, and RNA abundance of ADAR enzymes, following SARS-CoV-2 infection in human cell lines. Our results suggest that upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, compared to mock, the number of hyper editing sites is increased, and in agreement, the activity of ADAR1, which catalyzes hyper-editing, is enhanced. These results imply the involvement of A-to-I RNA editing in conceiving the unpredicted phenotype of COVID-19 disease.

34517953,In vitro and in cellula site-directed RNA editing using the λNDD-BoxB system.,"Site-directed RNA editing (SDRE) exploits the enzymatic activity of Adenosine Deaminases Acting on RNAs (ADAR) to program changes in genetic information as it passes through RNA. ADARs convert adenosine (A) to inosine (I) through a hydrolytic deamination and since I can be read as guanosine (G) during translation, this change can regulate gene function and correct G→A genetic mutations. In SDRE, ADARs are redirected to convert user-defined A's to I's. SDRE also has certain advantages over genome editing because the changes in RNA are reversible and thus safer. In addition, ADARs are endogenously expressed in humans and therefore unlikely to provoke immunological complications when administered. Recently, a variety of systems for SDRE have been developed. Some rely on harnessing endogenously expressed ADARs and other deliver engineered versions of ADAR's catalytic domain. All systems are currently under refinement, and there are still challenges associated with raising their efficiency and specificity to levels that are adequate for therapeutics. This chapter provides a detailed protocol for in vitro and in cellula editing assays using the λNDD-BoxB system, one of the first systems developed for SDRE. The λNDD-BoxB system relies on gRNAs that are linked to the catalytic domain of human ADAR2 through a small RNA binding protein-RNA stem/loop interaction.

34539640,Genetic Associations Between IL-6 and the Development of Autoimmune Arthritis Are Gender-Specific.,"OBJECTIVES: To find out the genetic association between IL6 and autoimmune arthritis. METHODS: We performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study using multiple genome-wide association studies (GWAS) datasets. Furthermore, a sex-stratified MR study was performed to identify sexual dimorphism in the association between IL6 and autoimmune arthritis. Then, LocusZoom plots were displayed based on the IL6R gene region to present evidence of genetic colocalization between diseases. RESULTS: The MR result denoted a genetic association between the increased level of IL-6 signaling and risk of RA (β=0.325, 95%CI 0.088, 0.561, p=7.08E-03) and AS (β=1.240, 95%CI 0.495, 1.980, p=1.1E-03). Accordingly, sIL6R was found to have negatively correlation with the onset of RA (β=-0.020, 95%CI -0.0320, -0.008, p=1.18E-03) and AS (β=-0.125, 95%CI -0.177, -0.073, p=2.29E-06). However, no genetic association between IL6/sIL6R and PsA was detected. The gender-stratified MR analysis showed that IL6 was associated with AS in the male population, with RA in the female population, and with PsA in the male population. Additionally, ADAR, a gene identified by a sensitive test, could be the reason for the nonsignificant association between IL6 and PsA in a pooled population. CONCLUSION: Our findings showed that the overactive IL6 signal pathway led to autoimmune arthritis, especially in RA and AS.

34616451,Upregulation of ADAR Promotes Breast Cancer Progression and Serves as a Potential Therapeutic Target.,"BACKGROUND: Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cause of cancer death worldwide, and its incidence is increasing every year. This study aims to investigate the expression characteristics of ADAR gene in breast cancer and to explore its role in the occurrence and development of BC and its possible mechanism. METHODS: TCGA portal was used to detect the expression of ADAR in cancer including BC, and its correlation with clinicopathological data as well as other genes was analyzed via UALCAN database. The TISCH database evaluated the expression of ADAR in different types of cell populations in BC at the single-cell level. The Kaplan-Meier plotter database was used to predict the correlation between ADAR expression and BC patient prognosis. The Human Protein Atlas was used to detect the expression of ADAR in tissues and location of ADAR mRNA in cells. Moreover, the relationships between immune response and ADAR expression in BC were assessed with the use of the TISIDB. Metascape and STRING were applied to predict ADAR with other protein interactions. Finally, the effect generated by ADAR expression on cell proliferating, invading, and migrating processes was assessed in vitro with knockdown and overexpression strategies. RESULTS: ADAR was significantly upregulated in BC tissues compared to paracancerous tissues. Single-cell RNA analysis showed that ADAR was specifically upregulated in cancer cell clusters and was also expressed in stromal and immune cell clusters. The upregulation of ADAR was positively correlated with clinicopathological stage and negatively correlated with BC prognosis. Experimental processes in vitro revealed ADAR knockdown hindered, proliferated, invaded, and migrated levels of BC cells, whereas over expression of ADAR played the opposite effect. ADAR protein, which may interact with OASL, STAT2, and IFIT3, was mainly located in the nucleoli in cells and primarily involved DNA modification and apoptotic signaling pathway. Immune factors may interact with ADAR in BC, and ADAR was found noticeably linked with immunosuppressor such as IL10, CD274, and IDO1. CONCLUSION: ADAR is significantly upregulated in breast cancer tissues, which may promote the progression of BC through the interaction of cancer cells, stromal cells, and immune cells. Targeting ADAR may offer new hope in treating breast cancer.",2021,J Oncol. 2021 Sep 27;2021:2012903. doi: 10.1155/2021/2012903. eCollection 2021.,"['Li X', 'Sun G', 'Wu L', 'Sun G', 'Cheng Y', 'Tao J', 'Li Z', 'Tang W', 'Wang H']",True

However, associations between Obj-SCD and p-tau181, and their combined prognostic potential, are unknown. METHODS: Baseline and 4-year longitudinal p-tau181 changes were compared across cognitively unimpaired (CU; n = 402), Obj-SCD (n = 199), and mild cognitive impairment (MCI; n = 346) groups. CU and Obj-SCD participants were further classified as p-tau181-positive or negative. RESULTS: CU and Obj-SCD has lower baseline p-tau181 than MCI and did not differ from one another. Longitudinally, Obj-SCD had the steepest p-tau181 increase. Obj-SCD/p-tau181-positive participants had the fastest rates of amyloid accumulation, cognitive decline, and functional decline. CONCLUSIONS: Despite assumptions that cognitive changes invariably follow biomarker changes, early neuropsychological difficulties may emerge before/concurrently with plasma p-tau181 changes.

Understanding the influence of mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 gene on clinical outcomes is critical for treatment and prevention. Here, we analyzed all high-coverage complete SARS-CoV-2 sequences from GISAID database from January 1, 2020, to January 1, 2021, to mine the mutation hotspots associated with clinical outcome and developed a model to predict the clinical outcome in different epidemic strains. Exploring the cause of mutation based on RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and RNA-editing enzyme, mutation was more likely to occur in severe and mild cases than in asymptomatic cases, especially A > G, C > T, and G > A mutations. The mutations associated with asymptomatic outcome were mainly in open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) and N genes; especially R6997P and V30L mutations occurred together and were correlated with asymptomatic outcome with high prevalence. D614G, Q57H, and S194L mutations were correlated with mild and severe outcome with high prevalence. Interestingly, the single-nucleotide variant (SNV) frequency was higher with high percentage of nt14408 mutation in RdRp in severe cases. The expression of ADAR and APOBEC was associated with clinical outcome. The model has shown that the asymptomatic percentage has increased over time, while there is high symptomatic percentage in Alpha, Beta, and Gamma. These findings suggest that mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 genome may have a direct association with clinical outcomes and pandemic.

34882682,Conservation of A-to-I RNA editing in bowhead whale and pig.,"RNA editing is a post-transcriptional process in which nucleotide changes are introduced into an RNA sequence, many of which can contribute to proteomic sequence variation. The most common type of RNA editing, contributing to nearly 99% of all editing events in RNA, is A-to-I (adenosine-to-inosine) editing mediated by double-stranded RNA-specific adenosine deaminase (ADAR) enzymes. A-to-I editing at 'recoding' sites results in non-synonymous substitutions in protein-coding sequences. Here, we present studies of the conservation of A-to-I editing in selected mRNAs between pigs, bowhead whales, humans and two shark species. All examined mRNAs-NEIL1, COG3, GRIA2, FLNA, FLNB, IGFBP7, AZIN1, BLCAP, GLI1, SON, HTR2C and ADAR2 -showed conservation of A-to-I editing of recoding sites. In addition, novel editing sites were identified in NEIL1 and GLI1 in bowhead whales. The A-to-I editing site of human NEIL1 in position 242 was conserved in the bowhead and porcine homologues. A novel editing site was discovered in Tyr244. Differential editing was detected at the two adenosines in the NEIL1 242 codon in both pig and bowhead NEIL1 mRNAs in various tissues and organs. No conservation of editing of KCNB1 and EEF1A mRNAs was seen in bowhead whales. In silico analyses revealed conservation of five adenosines in ADAR2, some of which are subject to A-to-I editing in bowheads and pigs, and conservation of a regulatory sequence in GRIA2 mRNA that is responsible for recognition of the ADAR editing enzyme.",2021,PLoS One. 2021 Dec 9;16(12):e0260081. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0260081. eCollection 2021.,"['Larsen K', 'Heide-Jørgensen MP']",False
34976013,A Novel Model of Tumor-Infiltrating B Lymphocyte Specific RNA-Binding Protein-Related Genes With Potential Prognostic Value and Therapeutic Targets in Multiple Myeloma.,"Background: RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) act as important regulators in the progression of tumors. However, their role in the tumorigenesis and prognostic assessment in multiple myeloma (MM), a B-cell hematological cancer, remains elusive. Thus, the current study was designed to explore a novel prognostic B-cell-specific RBP signature and the underlying molecular mechanisms. Methods: Data used in the current study were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Significantly upregulated RBPs in B cells were defined as B cell-specific RBPs. The biological functions of B-cell-specific RBPs were analyzed by the cluster Profiler package. Univariate and multivariate regressions were performed to identify robust prognostic B-cell specific RBP signatures, followed by the construction of the risk classification model. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)-identified pathways were enriched in stratified groups. The microenvironment of the low- and high-risk groups was analyzed by single-sample GSEA (ssGSEA). Moreover, the correlations among the risk score and differentially expressed immune checkpoints or differentially distributed immune cells were calculated. The drug sensitivity of the low- and high-risk groups was assessed via Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer by the pRRophetic algorithm. In addition, we utilized a GEO dataset involving patients with MM receiving bortezomib therapy to estimate the treatment response between different groups. Results: A total of 56 B-cell-specific RBPs were identified, which were mainly enriched in ribonucleoprotein complex biogenesis and the ribosome pathway. ADAR, FASTKD1 and SNRPD3 were identified as prognostic B-cell specific RBP signatures in MM. The risk model was constructed based on ADAR, FASTKD1 and SNRPD3. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves revealed the good predictive capacity of the risk model. A nomogram based on the risk score and other independent prognostic factors exhibited excellent performance in predicting the overall survival of MM patients. GSEA showed enrichment of the Notch signaling pathway and mRNA cis-splicing via spliceosomes in the high-risk group. Moreover, we found that the infiltration of diverse immune cell subtypes and the expression of CD274, CD276, CTLA4 and VTCN1 were significantly different between the two groups. In addition, the IC50 values of 11 drugs were higher in the low-risk group. Patients in the low-risk group exhibited a higher complete response rate to bortezomib therapy. Conclusion: Our study identified novel prognostic B-cell-specific RBP biomarkers in MM and constructed a unique risk model for predicting MM outcomes. Moreover, we explored the immune-related mechanisms of B cell-specific RBPs in regulating MM. Our findings could pave the way for developing novel therapeutic strategies to improve the prognosis of MM patients.",2021,Front Genet. 2021 Dec 17;12:778715. doi: 10.3389/fgene.2021.778715. eCollection 2021.,"['Zhang J', 'He P', 'Wang X', 'Wei S', 'Ma L', 'Zhao J']",True
35069693,Gene-Based Therapeutics for Inherited Retinal Diseases.,"Inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) are a heterogenous group of orphan eye diseases that typically result from monogenic mutations and are considered attractive targets for gene-based therapeutics. Following the approval of an IRD gene replacement therapy for Leber's congenital amaurosis due to RPE65 mutations, there has been an intensive international research effort to identify the optimal gene therapy approaches for a range of IRDs and many are now undergoing clinical trials. In this review we explore therapeutic challenges posed by IRDs and review current and future approaches that may be applicable to different subsets of IRD mutations. Emphasis is placed on five distinct approaches to gene-based therapy that have potential to treat the full spectrum of IRDs: 1) gene replacement using adeno-associated virus (AAV) and nonviral delivery vectors, 2) genome editing via the CRISPR/Cas9 system, 3) RNA editing by endogenous and exogenous ADAR, 4) mRNA targeting with antisense oligonucleotides for gene knockdown and splicing modification, and 5) optogenetic approaches that aim to replace the function of native retinal photoreceptors by engineering other retinal cell types to become capable of phototransduction.",2021,Front Genet. 2022 Jan 7;12:794805. doi: 10.3389/fgene.2021.794805. eCollection 2021.,"['Fenner BJ', 'Tan TE', 'Barathi AV', 'Tun SBB', 'Yeo SW', 'Tsai ASH', 'Lee SY', 'Cheung CMG', 'Chan CM', 'Mehta JS', 'Teo KYC']",False

From this point of view, epitranscriptomics represent a new layer for the control of genetic information and can affect a variety of molecular processes including the cell cycle and the differentiation. In physiological conditions, hematopoiesis is a tightly regulated process that produces differentiated blood cells starting from hematopoietic stem cells. Alteration of this process can occur at different levels in the pathway that leads from the genetic information to the phenotypic manifestation producing malignant hematopoiesis.

Using public RNA-sequencing data, we identified 35 vasoactive microRNAs that are A-to-I edited. We quantified A-to-I editing of the primary (pri-)microRNAs in vascular fibroblasts and endothelial cells. Nine pri-microRNAs were indeed edited, and editing consistently increased under ischemia. We determined mature microRNA editing for the highest expressed microRNAs, i.e., miR-376a-3p, miR-376c-3p, miR-381-3p, and miR-411-5p. All four mature microRNAs were edited in their seed sequence. We show that both ADAR1 and ADAR2 (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 and RNA 2) can edit pri-microRNAs in a microRNA-specific manner. MicroRNA editing also increased under ischemia in vivo in a murine hindlimb ischemia model and ex vivo in human veins. For each edited microRNA, we confirmed a shift in targetome. Expression of the edited microRNA targetomes, not the wild-type targetomes, was downregulated under ischemia in vivo. Furthermore, microRNA editing enhanced angiogenesis in vitro and ex vivo. In conclusion, we show that microRNA A-to-I editing is a widespread phenomenon, induced by ischemia. Each editing event results in a novel microRNA with a unique targetome, leading to increased angiogenesis.",2020 Sep 4,Mol Ther Nucleic Acids. 2020 Sep 4;21:932-953. doi: 10.1016/j.omtn.2020.07.020.

32992592,Host Immune Response Driving SARS-CoV-2 Evolution.,"The transmission and evolution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are of paramount importance in controlling and combating the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Currently, over 15,000 SARS-CoV-2 single mutations have been recorded, which have a great impact on the development of diagnostics, vaccines, antibody therapies, and drugs. However, little is known about SARS-CoV-2's evolutionary characteristics and general trend. In this work, we present a comprehensive genotyping analysis of existing SARS-CoV-2 mutations. We reveal that host immune response via APOBEC and ADAR gene editing gives rise to near 65% of recorded mutations. Additionally, we show that children under age five and the elderly may be at high risk from COVID-19 because of their overreaction to the viral infection. Moreover, we uncover that populations of Oceania and Africa react significantly more intensively to SARS-CoV-2 infection than those of Europe and Asia, which may explain why African Americans were shown to be at increased risk of dying from COVID-19, in addition to their high risk of COVID-19 infection caused by systemic health and social inequities. Finally, our study indicates that for two viral genome sequences of the same origin, their evolution order may be determined from the ratio of mutation type, C > T over T > C.",2020 Sep 27,Viruses. 2020 Sep 27;12(10):1095. doi: 10.3390/v12101095.,"['Wang R', 'Hozumi Y', 'Zheng YH', 'Yin C', 'Wei GW']",True
32957697,"RNA-Binding Proteins as Regulators of Migration, Invasion and Metastasis in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma.","Nearly 7.5% of all human protein-coding genes have been assigned to the class of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), and over the past decade, RBPs have been increasingly recognized as important regulators of molecular and cellular homeostasis. RBPs regulate the post-transcriptional processing of their target RNAs, i.e., alternative splicing, polyadenylation, stability and turnover, localization, or translation as well as editing and chemical modification, thereby tuning gene expression programs of diverse cellular processes such as cell survival and malignant spread. Importantly, metastases are the major cause of cancer-associated deaths in general, and particularly in oral cancers, which account for 2% of the global cancer mortality. However, the roles and architecture of RBPs and RBP-controlled expression networks during the diverse steps of the metastatic cascade are only incompletely understood. In this review, we will offer a brief overview about RBPs and their general contribution to post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Subsequently, we will highlight selected examples of RBPs that have been shown to play a role in oral cancer cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. Last but not least, we will present targeting strategies that have been developed to interfere with the function of some of these RBPs.",2020 Sep 17,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 Sep 17;21(18):6835. doi: 10.3390/ijms21186835.,"['Weiße J', 'Rosemann J', 'Krauspe V', 'Kappler M', 'Eckert AW', 'Haemmerle M', 'Gutschner T']",False
32912133,Parallel analysis of miRNAs and mRNAs suggests distinct regulatory networks in Crassostrea gigas infected by Ostreid herpesvirus 1.,"BACKGROUND: Since 2008, the aquaculture production of Crassostrea gigas was heavily affected by mass mortalities associated to Ostreid herpesvirus 1 (OsHV-1) microvariants worldwide. Transcriptomic studies revealed the major antiviral pathways of the oyster immune response while other findings suggested that also small non-coding RNAs (sncRNA) such as microRNAs might act as key regulators of the oyster response against OsHV-1. To explore the explicit connection between small non-coding and protein-coding transcripts, we performed paired whole transcriptome analysis of sncRNA and messenger RNA (mRNA) in six oysters selected for different intensities of OsHV-1 infection. RESULTS: The mRNA profiles of the naturally infected oysters were mostly governed by the transcriptional activity of OsHV-1, with several differentially expressed genes mapping to the interferon, toll, apoptosis, and pro-PO pathways. In contrast, miRNA profiles suggested more complex regulatory mechanisms, with 15 differentially expressed miRNAs (DE-miRNA) pointing to a possible modulation of the host response during OsHV-1 infection. We predicted 68 interactions between DE-miRNAs and oyster 3'-UTRs, but only few of them involved antiviral genes. The sncRNA reads assigned to OsHV-1 rather resembled mRNA degradation products, suggesting the absence of genuine viral miRNAs. CONCLUSIONS: We provided data describing the miRNAome during OsHV-1 infection in C. gigas. This information can be used to understand the role of miRNAs in healthy and diseased oysters, to identify new targets for functional studies and, eventually to disentangle cause and effect relationships during viral infections in marine mollusks.",2020 Sep 10,BMC Genomics. 2020 Sep 10;21(1):620. doi: 10.1186/s12864-020-07026-7.,"['Rosani U', 'Abbadi M', 'Green T', 'Bai CM', 'Turolla E', 'Arcangeli G', 'Wegner KM', 'Venier P']",True
32731914,"How Z-DNA/RNA binding proteins shape homeostasis, inflammation, and immunity.","The right-handed double-helical structure of DNA (B-DNA), which follows the Watson-Crick model, is the canonical form of DNA existing in normal physiological settings. Even though an alternative left-handed structure of DNA (Z-DNA) was discovered in the late 1970s, Z-form nucleic acid has not received much attention from biologists, because it is extremely unstable under physiological conditions, has an ill-defined mechanism of its formation, and has obscure biological functions. The debate about the physiological relevance of Z-DNA was settled only after a class of proteins was found to potentially recognize the Z-form architecture of DNA. Interestingly, these Z-DNA binding proteins can bind not only the left-handed form of DNA but also the equivalent structure of RNA (Z-RNA). The Z-DNA/RNA binding proteins present from viruses to humans function as important regulators of biological processes. In particular, the proteins ADAR1 and ZBP1 are currently being extensively re-evaluated in the field to understand potential roles of the noncanonical Z-conformation of nucleic acids in host immune responses and human disease. Despite a growing body of evidence supporting the biological importance of Z-DNA/RNA, there remain many unanswered principal questions, such as when Z-form nucleic acids arise and how they signal to downstream pathways. Understanding Z-DNA/RNA and the sensors in different pathophysiological conditions will widen our view on the regulation of immune responses and open a new door of opportunity to develop novel types of immunomodulatory therapeutic possibilities.

Under homeostatic conditions aberrant activation of melanoma differentiation-associated protein-5 (MDA5) is prevented through editing of endogenous dsRNA by RNA editing enzyme Adenosine Deaminase Acting on RNA (ADAR1). In addition, ADAR1 is postulated to play pro-viral and antiviral roles during viral infections that are dependent or independent of RNA editing activity. Here, we investigated the importance of ADAR1 isoforms in modulating influenza A virus (IAV) replication and revealed the opposing roles for ADAR1 isoforms, with the nuclear p110 isoform restricting versus the cytoplasmic p150 isoform promoting IAV replication. Importantly, we demonstrate that p150 is critical for preventing sustained RIG-I signaling, as p150 deficient cells showed increased IFN-β expression and apoptosis during IAV infection, independent of RNA editing activity. Taken together, the p150 isoform of ADAR1 is important for preventing sustained RIG-I induced IFN-β expression and apoptosis during viral infection.",2020 Sep,PLoS Pathog. 2020 Sep 8;16(9):e1008842. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1008842. eCollection 2020 Sep.,"['Vogel OA', 'Han J', 'Liang CY', 'Manicassamy S', 'Perez JT', 'Manicassamy B']",True
32958664,A phenolic small molecule inhibitor of RNase L prevents cell death from ADAR1 deficiency.,"The oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)-RNase L system is an IFN-inducible antiviral pathway activated by viral infection. Viral double-stranded (ds) RNA activates OAS isoforms that synthesize the second messenger 2-5A, which binds and activates the pseudokinase-endoribonuclease RNase L. In cells, OAS activation is tamped down by ADAR1, an adenosine deaminase that destabilizes dsRNA. Mutation of ADAR1 is one cause of Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS), an interferonopathy in children. ADAR1 deficiency in human cells can lead to RNase L activation and subsequent cell death. To evaluate RNase L as a possible therapeutic target for AGS, we sought to identify small-molecule inhibitors of RNase L. A 500-compound library of protein kinase inhibitors was screened for modulators of RNase L activity in vitro. We identified ellagic acid (EA) as a hit with 10-fold higher selectivity against RNase L compared with its nearest paralog, IRE1. SAR analysis identified valoneic acid dilactone (VAL) as a superior inhibitor of RNase L, with 100-fold selectivity over IRE1. Mechanism-of-action analysis indicated that EA and VAL do not bind to the pseudokinase domain of RNase L despite acting as ATP competitive inhibitors of the protein kinase CK2. VAL is nontoxic and functional in cells, although with a 1,000-fold decrease in potency, as measured by RNA cleavage activity in response to treatment with dsRNA activator or by rescue of cell lethality resulting from self dsRNA induced by ADAR1 deficiency.

33106178,RNA editing in cancer impacts mRNA abundance in immune response pathways.,"BACKGROUND: RNA editing generates modifications to the RNA sequences, thereby increasing protein diversity and shaping various layers of gene regulation. Recent studies have revealed global shifts in editing levels across many cancer types, as well as a few specific mechanisms implicating individual sites in tumorigenesis or metastasis. However, most tumor-associated sites, predominantly in noncoding regions, have unknown functional relevance. RESULTS: Here, we carry out integrative analysis of RNA editing profiles between epithelial and mesenchymal tumors, since epithelial-mesenchymal transition is a key paradigm for metastasis. We identify distinct editing patterns between epithelial and mesenchymal tumors in seven cancer types using TCGA data, an observation further supported by single-cell RNA sequencing data and ADAR perturbation experiments in cell culture. Through computational analyses and experimental validations, we show that differential editing sites between epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes function by regulating mRNA abundance of their respective genes. Our analysis of RNA-binding proteins reveals ILF3 as a potential regulator of this process, supported by experimental validations. Consistent with the known roles of ILF3 in immune response, epithelial-mesenchymal differential editing sites are enriched in genes involved in immune and viral processes. The strongest target of editing-dependent ILF3 regulation is the transcript encoding PKR, a crucial player in immune and viral response.

In particular, it involves editing of mRNA codons with the resulting amino acid substitutions. We identified such sites for developmental proteomes of Drosophila melanogaster at the protein level using available data for 15 stages of fruit fly development from egg to imago and 14 time points of embryogenesis. In total, 40 sites were obtained, each belonging to a unique protein, including four sites related to embryogenesis. The interactome analysis has revealed that the majority of the editing-recoded proteins were associated with synaptic vesicle trafficking and actomyosin organization. Quantitation data analysis suggested the existence of a phase-specific RNA editing regulation with yet unknown mechanisms. These findings supported the transcriptome analysis results, which showed that a burst in the RNA editing occurs during insect metamorphosis from pupa to imago. Finally, targeted proteomic analysis was performed to quantify editing-recoded and genomically encoded versions of five proteins in brains of larvae, pupae, and imago insects, which showed a clear tendency toward an increase in the editing rate for each of them.

33066171,De Novo A-to-I RNA Editing Discovery in lncRNA.,"BACKGROUND: Adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing is the most frequent editing event in humans. It converts adenosine to inosine in double-stranded RNA regions (in coding and non-coding RNAs) through the action of the adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) enzymes. Long non-coding RNAs, particularly abundant in the brain, account for a large fraction of the human transcriptome, and their important regulatory role is becoming progressively evident in both normal and transformed cells. RESULTS: Herein, we present a bioinformatic analysis to generate a comprehensive inosinome picture in long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), using an ad hoc index and searching for de novo editing events in the normal brain cortex as well as in glioblastoma, a highly aggressive human brain cancer. We discovered >10,000 new sites and 335 novel lncRNAs that undergo editing, never reported before.

However, efforts to define the mechanistic effects for disease associated ADAR1 mutations and the rational design of ADAR1 inhibitors are limited by a lack of structural information. Here, we describe the combination of high throughput mutagenesis screening studies, biochemical characterization and Rosetta-based structure modeling to identify unique features of ADAR1. Importantly, these studies reveal a previously unknown zinc-binding site on the surface of the ADAR1 deaminase domain which is important for ADAR1 editing activity.

32439581,Decrease in ADAR1 expression by exposure to cigarette smoke enhances susceptibility to oxidative stress.,"Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing, catalyzed by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) enzymes, is the most frequent type of post-transcriptional nucleotide conversion in humans. It is known that innate abnormalities of A-to-I RNA editing are associated with the risk of certain diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Extrinsic factors that modulate ADAR-mediated RNA editing remain to be clarified. In this study, we investigated the possibility that cigarette smoking may influence the expression of ADAR and that the changes may be biologically significant. Treatment of human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells with cigarette smoke extract (CSE) induced a significant 50% decrease in ADAR1 protein levels. Since the decrease was counteracted by cotreatment with chloroquine, the CSE-dependent decrease in the ADAR1 protein levels may be due to the activation of autophagy. In addition to the in vitro study, we performed an in vivo study in mice and found a decrease in pulmonary Adar1 protein expression induced by cigarette smoking. Then, we investigated the biological significance of decreased ADAR1 expression. We found that knockdown of ADAR1 in A549 cells by siRNA resulted in an increase in the levels of protein carbonyl, a marker of oxidative stress. Moreover, knockdown of ADAR1 triggered a decrease in super oxide dismutase activity and heme oxygenase-1 expression, suggesting that ADAR1 plays a role to suppress oxidative stress. In conclusion, we show that ADAR1 expression is decreased by cigarette smoking and is a factor that contributes to the enhanced intracellular oxidative stress caused by cigarette smoking.",2020 Oct 1,Toxicol Lett. 2020 Oct 1;331:22-32. doi: 10.1016/j.toxlet.2020.05.019.

32968282,Functional genomic landscape of cancer-intrinsic evasion of killing by T cells.,"The genetic circuits that allow cancer cells to evade destruction by the host immune system remain poorly understood(1-3). Here, to identify a phenotypically robust core set of genes and pathways that enable cancer cells to evade killing mediated by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), we performed genome-wide CRISPR screens across a panel of genetically diverse mouse cancer cell lines that were cultured in the presence of CTLs. We identify a core set of 182 genes across these mouse cancer models, the individual perturbation of which increases either the sensitivity or the resistance of cancer cells to CTL-mediated toxicity. Systematic exploration of our dataset using genetic co-similarity reveals the hierarchical and coordinated manner in which genes and pathways act in cancer cells to orchestrate their evasion of CTLs, and shows that discrete functional modules that control the interferon response and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-induced cytotoxicity are dominant sub-phenotypes. Our data establish a central role for genes that were previously identified as negative regulators of the type-II interferon response (for example, Ptpn2, Socs1 and Adar1) in mediating CTL evasion, and show that the lipid-droplet-related gene Fitm2 is required for maintaining cell fitness after exposure to interferon-γ (IFNγ). In addition, we identify the autophagy pathway as a conserved mediator of the evasion of CTLs by cancer cells, and show that this pathway is required to resist cytotoxicity induced by the cytokines IFNγ and TNF.

32707273,Circular RNA circBbs9 promotes PM(2.5)-induced lung inflammation in mice via NLRP3 inflammasome activation.,"Fine particulate matter (PM(2.5)) is one of the most important components of environmental pollutants, and is associated with pulmonary injury. However, the biological mechanisms of pulmonary damage caused by PM(2.5) are poorly defined, especially the molecular pathways related to inflammation. Following system exposure to PM(2.5) for 3 months in normal mice and in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) model mice, it was found that PM(2.5) exposure increased the expression of IL-1β and IL-18 in lung tissues via NLRP3 activation, and these effects were more intense in COPD model mice. Circular RNA (circRNA) sequencing showed that the expression profiles of circRNAs were changed after PM(2.5) exposure, and the positive roles of circBbs9 in inflammation induced by PM(2.5) were verified. The circBbs9 knockdown alleviated PM(2.5)-induced inflammation via NLRP3 inflammasome inactivation, as well as IL-1β and IL-18 inhibition in RAW264.7 cells, while overexpression of circBbs9 had the opposite effect. Bioinformatics and luciferase reporter assays showed that circBbs9 bound to microRNA-30e-5p (miR-30e-5p) and co-regulated the expression of Adar, a downstream target gene of miR-30e-5p. Taken together, these results revealed that PM(2.5) induced pulmonary inflammation through NLRP3 inflammasome activation regulated by the circBbs9-miR-30e-5p-Adar pathway.

Movement disorders (MDs) commonly occur in ADAR1-related diseases although a complete overview on the phenomenology has not been provided yet. Here, a cohort of 57 patients with ADAR1-related diseases, including 3 unpublished patients and 54 previously reported cases, was reviewed. Data on demographics, clinical features of MDs, genetics and biomarkers were collected and descriptive statistics, group analysis for genotype and logistic regression were run. Manifestations of MD characterized the onset of ADAR1-related disease in 60% of patients. Specifically, dystonia occurred in 39% of cases, even as severe status dystonicus, while prevalence of other MDs was lower. Patients often presented brain lesions (>90%) and progressive disease course (43%), fatal in some cases. Clinical presentation and outcome differed among patients with distinct genotype. This review shows that phenomenology of MDs in ADAR1-related diseases is wide and heterogeneous, although a severe motor syndrome (often characterized by dystonia) secondary to brain lesions represents the most common manifestation. Waiting for future development of disease-modifying treatments, an appropriate symptomatic intervention is crucial for ADAR1 patients.

33265998,The ADAR Family in Amphioxus: RNA Editing and Conserved Orthologous Site Predictions.,"RNA editing is a relatively unexplored process in which transcribed RNA is modified at specific nucleotides before translation, adding another level of regulation of gene expression. Cephalopods use it extensively to increase the regulatory complexity of their nervous systems, and mammals use it too, but less prominently. Nevertheless, little is known about the specifics of RNA editing in most of the other clades and the relevance of RNA editing from an evolutionary perspective remains unknown. Here we analyze a key element of the editing machinery, the ADAR (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA) gene family, in an animal with a key phylogenetic position at the root of chordates: the cephalochordate amphioxus. We show, that as in cephalopods, ADAR genes in amphioxus are predominantly expressed in the nervous system; we identify a number of RNA editing events in amphioxus; and we provide a newly developed method to identify RNA editing events in highly polymorphic genomes using orthology as a guide.

Due to the sufficient nature of the 3' gRNA extension sequence, we observe that Cas9 gRNA spacer sequences are dispensable for directed RNA editing, revealing that Cas9 can act as an RNA-aptamer-binding protein.

32967960,Interferon Regulatory Factor 7 Attenuates Chronic Gammaherpesvirus Infection.,"Gammaherpesviruses are ubiquitous pathogens that establish lifelong infections and are associated with a variety of malignancies, including lymphomas. Interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF-7) is an innate immune transcription factor that restricts acute replication of diverse viruses, including murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68). Importantly, very little is known about the role of IRF-7 during chronic virus infections. In this study, we demonstrate that IRF-7 attenuates chronic infection by restricting establishment of gammaherpesvirus latency in the peritoneal cavity and, to a lesser extent, viral reactivation in the spleen. Despite the classical role of IRF-7 as a stimulator of type I interferon (IFN) transcription, there were no global effects on the expression of IFN-induced genes (ISGs) in the absence of IRF-7, with only a few ISGs showing attenuated expression in IRF-7-deficient peritoneal cells. Further, IRF-7 expression was dispensable for the induction of a virus-specific CD8 T cell response. In contrast, IRF-7 expression restricted latent gammaherpesvirus infection in the peritoneal cavity under conditions where the viral latent reservoir is predominantly hosted by peritoneal B cells. This report is the first demonstration of the antiviral role of IRF-7 during the chronic stage of gammaherpesvirus infection.IMPORTANCE The innate immune system of the host is critical for the restriction of acute viral infections. In contrast, the role of the innate immune network during chronic herpesvirus infection remains poorly defined. Interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF-7) is a transcription factor with many target genes, including type I interferons (IFNs). In this study, we show that the antiviral role of IRF-7 continues into the chronic phase of gammaherpesvirus infection, wherein IRF-7 restricts the establishment of viral latency and viral reactivation. This study is, to our knowledge, the first to define the role of IRF-7 in chronic virus infection.",2020 Nov 23,J Virol. 2020 Nov 23;94(24):e01554-20. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01554-20.

A variety of editors have been created, but a genetically encoded editor that is both precise and efficient has not been described to date. The trade-off between precision and efficiency is exemplified in the state of the art editor REPAIR, which comprises the ADAR2 deaminase domain fused to dCas13b. REPAIR is highly efficient, but also causes significant off-target effects. Mutations that weaken the deaminase domain can minimize the undesirable effects, but this comes at the expense of on-target editing efficiency. We have now overcome this dilemma by using a multipronged approach: We have chosen an alternative Cas protein (CasRx), inserted the deaminase domain into the middle of CasRx, and redirected the editor to the nucleus. The new editor created, dubbed REPAIRx, is precise yet highly efficient, outperforming various previous versions on both mRNA and nuclear RNA targets.

33172486,Circular RNA hsa_circ_0004872 inhibits gastric cancer progression via the miR-224/Smad4/ADAR1 successive regulatory circuit.,"BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence has shown that circular RNAs (circRNAs) play a crucial regulatory role in the occurrence and development of cancer. Exploring the roles and mechanisms of circRNAs in tumorigenesis and progression may help to identify new diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets. In the present study, we investigated the role and regulatory mechanism of hsa_circ_0004872 in gastric cancer (GC). METHODS: qRT-PCR was used to determine the expression of hsa_circ_0004872 in GC tissues and cells. EdU, CCK-8, transwell and scratch wound healing assays were used to assess the role of hsa_circ_0004872 in GC cell proliferation, invasion and migration, respectively. Subcutaneous and tail vein tumor injections in nude mice were used to assess the role of hsa_circ_0004872 in vivo. RIP assay, biotin-coupled probe pull-down assay, FISH and luciferase reporter assay were performed to confirm the relationship between hsa_circ_0004872 and the identified miRNA. ChIP assay, luciferase reporter assay and western blot were used to determine the direct binding of Smad4 to the promoter of the ADAR1 gene. RESULTS: In this study, we found that hsa_circ_0004872 was dramatically downregulated in GC tissues compared with adjacent noncancerous tissues. The expression level of hsa_circ_0004872 was associated with tumor size and local lymph node metastasis. Enforced expression of hsa_circ_0004872 inhibited the proliferation, invasion and migration of GC cells, whereas knockdown of hsa_circ_0004872 had the opposite effects. Nude mice experiments showed that ectopic expression of hsa_circ_0004872 dramatically inhibited tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Moreover, we demonstrated that hsa_circ_0004872 acted as a ""molecular sponge"" for miR-224 to upregulate the expression of the miR-224 downstream targets p21 and Smad4. Importantly, we found that the RNA-editing enzyme ADAR1 inhibited hsa_circ_0004872 expression and further led to the upregulation of miR-224. Smad4, the downstream target of miR-224, could further affect hsa_circ_0004872 levels by directly binding to the promoter region of ADAR1 to inhibit ADAR1 expression. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings showed that hsa_circ_0004872 acted as a tumor suppressor in GC by forming a negative regulatory loop consisting of hsa_circ_0004872/miR-224/Smad4/ADAR1. Thus, hsa_circ_0004872 may serve as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for GC.",2020 Nov 10,Mol Cancer. 2020 Nov 10;19(1):157. doi: 10.1186/s12943-020-01268-5.,"['Ma C', 'Wang X', 'Yang F', 'Zang Y', 'Liu J', 'Wang X', 'Xu X', 'Li W', 'Jia J', 'Liu Z']",True

As part of establishing a ""healthy population ""(HP) background or base-line, we investigated whether such mosaicism can be routinely detected in the circulating DNA secured from a rigorously designed healthy human liquid biopsy clinical trial (saliva, blood). We deployed next generation (NG) whole exome sequencing (WES) at median exome coverage rates of 97.2 % (-to-30x) and 70.0 % (-to-100x). We found that somatic mosaicism is not detectable by such standard bulk WES sequencing assays in saliva and blood DNA in 24 normal healthy Caucasians of both sexes from 18 to 60 years of age. We conclude that for circulating DNA using standard WES no novel somatic mutational variants can be detected in protein-coding regions of normal healthy subjects.

32201888,Spatially regulated editing of genetic information within a neuron.,"In eukaryotic cells, with the exception of the specialized genomes of mitochondria and plastids, all genetic information is sequestered within the nucleus. This arrangement imposes constraints on how the information can be tailored for different cellular regions, particularly in cells with complex morphologies like neurons. Although messenger RNAs (mRNAs), and the proteins that they encode, can be differentially sorted between cellular regions, the information itself does not change. RNA editing by adenosine deamination can alter the genome's blueprint by recoding mRNAs; however, this process too is thought to be restricted to the nucleus. In this work, we show that ADAR2 (adenosine deaminase that acts on RNA), an RNA editing enzyme, is expressed outside of the nucleus in squid neurons. Furthermore, purified axoplasm exhibits adenosine-to-inosine activity and can specifically edit adenosines in a known substrate. Finally, a transcriptome-wide analysis of RNA editing reveals that tens of thousands of editing sites (>70% of all sites) are edited more extensively in the squid giant axon than in its cell bodies.

Although miRNAs have been previously shown to play a crucial role in CLL development, progression and treatment resistance, their further processing and diversification by RNA editing (specifically adenosine to inosine or cytosine to uracil deamination) has not been addressed so far. In this study, we analyzed next generation sequencing data to provide a detailed map of adenosine to inosine and cytosine to uracil changes in miRNAs from CLL and normal B cells. Our results reveal that in addition to a CLL-specific expression pattern, there is also specific RNA editing of many miRNAs, particularly miR-3157 and miR-6503, in CLL.

METHOD: Over a 14-day period, 58 PLHIV and 32 HIV-uninfected individuals (aged 50-74) completed the mCWIT on smartphones once per day in real-world settings. Participants also completed a comprehensive laboratory-based neuropsychological evaluation. RESULTS: A high rate of compliance was observed (86%) in the repeated administration of the mCWIT. A practice effect was observed in the overall sample concerning mCWIT subscores, and these learning effects were greater for PLHIV. Stabilization of performance was observed after 6 (HIV+) and 7 days (HIV-) for completion time and after 2 (HIV-) and 3 days (HIV+) for mCWIT errors. A minor fatigue effect was observed in the overall sample which was unassociated with group status. Moderate to strong correlations were found between mCWIT completion time and mCWIT errors with global neurocognition and with all of the individual neurocognitive domains. The strongest associations were with mCWIT completion time and laboratory-based global neurocognition, executive function, and working memory scores.

Regulatory effects on AMPAR subunit composition and RNA-editing in the developing brain and their significance as therapeutic targets are not well understood. Here, we analyzed acute effects of recurrent pilocarpine-induced neonatal seizures on age- and region-specific expression of AMPAR subunits and adenosine deaminases (ADAR) in the developing mouse brain (P10). After recurrent seizure activity and regeneration periods of 6-72 h cerebral mRNA levels of GluR (glutamate receptor subunit) 1, GluR2, GluR3, and GluR4 were unaffected compared to controls. However, ratio of GluR2 and GluR4 to pooled GluR1-4 mRNA concentration significantly decreased in seizure-exposed brains in comparison to controls. After a regeneration period of 24-72 h ADAR1 and ADAR2 mRNA expression was significantly lower in seizure-exposed brains than in those of controls. This was confirmed at the protein level in the hippocampal CA3 region. We observed a regionally increased apoptosis (TUNEL+ and CC3+ cells) in the hippocampus, parietal cortex and subventricular zone of seizure-exposed brains in comparison to controls. Together, present in vivo data demonstrate the maturational age-specific, functional role of RNA-edited GluR2 in seizure-induced excitotoxicity in the developing mouse brain. In response to recurrent seizure activity, we observed reduced expression of GluR2 and the GluR2 mRNA-editing enzymes ADAR1 and ADAR2 accompanied by increased apoptosis in a region-specific manner.

The aim of this study is to evaluate expression and copy number variation of the ADAR gene in advanced GC and clarify its correlation with survival and histopathological characteristics. METHODS: Forty two patients with stage III and IV GC were included in this study. ADAR gene expression and copy number variation were measured by real-time PCR and Quantitative multiplex fluorescent-PCR, respectively. Survival analysis performed based on the Kaplan-Meier method and Mantel-Cox test. RESULTS: ADAR mRNA was significantly overexpressed in the tumor tissues when compared to the adjacent normal tissues (p < 0.01). Also, ADAR expression level in stage IV was higher than stage III. 40% of patients showed amplification in ADAR gene and there was a positive correlation between ADAR copy number and expression. Increased ADAR expression was clearly correlated with poorer survival outcomes and Mantel-Cox test showed statistically significant differences between low and high expression groups (p < 0.0001).

We identified 14 development related genes that were not activated in the cloned embryos. Then, 68 and 245 long non-coding RNAs were recognized abnormally expressed in cloned 2-cell embryos and cloned blastocysts, respectively.

31413087,IL6R-STAT3-ADAR1 (P150) interplay promotes oncogenicity in multiple myeloma with 1q21 amplification.,"1q21 amplification is an important prognostic marker in multiple myeloma. In this study we identified that IL6R (the interleukin-6 membrane receptor) and ADAR1 (an RNA editing enzyme) are critical genes located within the minimally amplified 1q21 region. Loss of individual genes caused suppression to the oncogenic phenotypes, the magnitude of which was enhanced when both genes were concomitantly lost. Mechanistically, IL6R and ADAR1 collaborated to induce a hyper-activation of the oncogenic STAT3 pathway. High IL6R confers hypersensitivity to interleukin-6 binding, whereas, ADAR1 forms a constitutive feed-forward loop with STAT3 in a P150-isoform-predominant manner. In this respect, ADAR1-P150 acts as a direct transcriptional target for STAT3 and this STAT3-induced-P150 in turn directly interacts with and stabilizes the former protein, leading to a larger pool of proteins acting as oncogenic transcription factors for pro-survival genes. The importance of both IL6R and ADAR1-P150 in STAT3 signaling was further validated when concomitant knockdown of both genes impeded IL6-induced-STAT3 pathway activation. Clinical evaluation of various datasets of myeloma patients showed that low expression of either one or both genes was closely associated with a compromised STAT3 signature, confirming the involvement of IL6R and ADAR1 in the STAT3 pathway and underscoring their essential role in disease pathogenesis. In summary, our findings highlight the complexity of the STAT3 pathway in myeloma, in association with 1q21 amplification. This study therefore reveals a novel perspective on 1q21 abnormalities in myeloma and a potential therapeutic target for this cohort of high-risk patients.",2020 May,Haematologica. 2020 May;105(5):1391-1404. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2019.221176.

32821499,Clinical and Genetic Characteristics of 15 Affected Patients From 12 Japanese Families with GUCY2D-Associated Retinal Disorder.,"PURPOSE: To determine the clinical and genetic characteristics of patients with GUCY2D-associated retinal disorder (GUCY2D-RD). METHODS: Fifteen patients from 12 families with inherited retinal disorder (IRD) and harboring GUCY2D variants were ascertained from 730 Japanese families with IRD. Comprehensive ophthalmological examinations, including visual acuity (VA) measurement, retinal imaging, and electrophysiological assessment were performed to classify patients into three phenotype subgroups; macular dystrophy (MD), cone-rod dystrophy (CORD), and Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA). In silico analysis was performed for the detected variants, and the molecularly confirmed inheritance pattern was determined (autosomal dominant/recessive [AD/AR]). RESULTS: The median age of onset/examination was 22.0/38.0 years (ranges, 0-55 and 1-73) with a median VA of 0.80/0.70 LogMAR units (ranges, 0.00-1.52 and 0.10-1.52) in the right/left eye, respectively. Macular atrophy was identified in seven patients (46.7%), and two had diffuse fundus disturbance (13.3%), and six had an essentially normal fundus (40.0%). There were 11 patients with generalized cone-rod dysfunction (78.6%), two with entire functional loss (14.3%), and one with confined macular dysfunction (7.1%). There were nine families with ADCORD, one with ARCORD, one with ADMD, and one with ARLCA. Ten GUCY2D variants were identified, including four novel variants (p.Val56GlyfsTer262, p.Met246Ile, p.Arg761Trp, p.Glu874Lys). CONCLUSIONS: This large cohort study delineates the disease spectrum of GUCY2D-RD. Diverse clinical presentations with various severities of ADCORD and the early-onset severe phenotype of ARLCA are illustrated. A relatively lower prevalence of GUCY2D-RD for ADCORD and ARLCA in the Japanese population was revealed.

32044725,Novel Engineered Programmable Systems for ADAR-Mediated RNA Editing.,"One of the most prevalent forms of post-transcriptional RNA modification is the conversion of adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I), mediated by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) enzymes. The advent of the CRISPR/Cas systems inspires researchers to work actively in the engineering of programmable RNA-guided machines for basic research and biomedical applications. In this regard, CIRTS (CRISPR-Cas-Inspired RNA Targeting System), RESCUE (RNA Editing for Specific C to U Exchange), RESTORE (Recruiting Endogenous ADAR to Specific Transcripts for Oligonucleotide-mediated RNA Editing), and LEAPER (Leveraging Endogenous ADAR for Programmable Editing of RNA) are innovative RNA base-editing platforms that have recently been engineered to perform programmable base conversions on target RNAs mediated by ADAR enzymes in mammalian cells. Thus, these four currently characterized RNA-editing systems constitute novel molecular tools with compelling programmability, specificity, and efficiency that show us some creative ways to take advantage of the engineered deaminases for precise base editing. Moreover, the advanced engineering of these systems permits editing of full-length transcripts containing disease-causing point mutations without the loss of genomic information, providing an attractive alternative for in vivo research and in the therapeutic setting if the challenges encountered in off-target edits and delivery are appropriately addressed. Here, I present an analytical approach of the current status and rapid progress of the novel ADAR-mediated RNA-editing systems when highlighting the qualities of each new RNA-editing platform and how these RNA-targeting strategies could be used to recruit human ADARs on endogenous transcripts, not only for our understanding of RNA-modification-mediated regulation of gene expression but also for editing clinically relevant mutations in a programmable and straightforward manner.",2020 Mar 6,Mol Ther Nucleic Acids. 2020 Mar 6;19:1065-1072. doi: 10.1016/j.omtn.2019.12.042.

32221286,Adar RNA editing-dependent and -independent effects are required for brain and innate immune functions in Drosophila.,"ADAR RNA editing enzymes are high-affinity dsRNA-binding proteins that deaminate adenosines to inosines in pre-mRNA hairpins and also exert editing-independent effects. We generated a Drosophila Adar(E374A) mutant strain encoding a catalytically inactive Adar with CRISPR/Cas9. We demonstrate that Adar adenosine deamination activity is necessary for normal locomotion and prevents age-dependent neurodegeneration. The catalytically inactive protein, when expressed at a higher than physiological level, can rescue neurodegeneration in Adar mutants, suggesting also editing-independent effects. Furthermore, loss of Adar RNA editing activity leads to innate immune induction, indicating that Drosophila Adar, despite being the homolog of mammalian ADAR2, also has functions similar to mammalian ADAR1. The innate immune induction in fly Adar mutants is suppressed by silencing of Dicer-2, which has a RNA helicase domain similar to MDA5 that senses unedited dsRNAs in mammalian Adar1 mutants. Our work demonstrates that the single Adar enzyme in Drosophila unexpectedly has dual functions.",2020 Mar 27,Nat Commun. 2020 Mar 27;11(1):1580. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-15435-1.,"['Deng P', 'Khan A', 'Jacobson D', 'Sambrani N', 'McGurk L', 'Li X', 'Jayasree A', 'Hejatko J', 'Shohat-Ophir G', ""O'Connell MA"", 'Li JB', 'Keegan LP']",True
31959472,ADAR1p150 regulates the biosynthesis and function of miRNA-149* in human melanoma.,"Melanoma is an aggressive malignant skin tumor. Study found that miR-149* was abnormally expressed in melanoma. Adenosine deaminases acting on the RNA1 (ADAR1) is an RNA editing enzyme. It can change the structure and function of miRNA. In this study, we investigate the role of ADAR1 in regulation of miRNA-149* in melanoma. Western-blot analysis was used to analyze the expression of ADAR1p150, ADAR1p110 and GSK3α at protein level. The expression of ADAR1p150, miR-149* and GSK3α at mRNA level were detected using qRT-PCR. Co-immunoprecipitation test was then performed to determine the interaction between ADAR1 and Dicer. Target verification of miRNA-149*/GSK3α was carried out using luciferase reporter assay. CCK-8 was used to detect cell proliferation. Cell apoptosis was tested using Tunel assays. The expression level of ADAR1p150 was found to be increased in human melanoma tissues, but not ADAR1p110. There was a direct interaction between ADAR1p150 and Dicer in melanoma cells. MiRNA-149* was significantly up-regulated in melanoma tissues and melanoma cells. Luciferase reporter assay suggested that GSK3α was a directly target of miR-149*. The expression level of miR-149* showed a positive correlation with ADAR1p150. At the same time, ADAR1p150 expression was negatively correlated with the expression of GSK3α. ADAR1p150 promoted proliferation of melanoma cells and inhibited cell apoptosis. ADAR1p150 can promote the biosynthesis and function of miRNA-149* in melanoma cells which makes it be considered as both a bio-marker and a therapeutic target for treatment of melanoma.",2020 Mar 19,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2020 Mar 19;523(4):900-907. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.12.110.

32123111,Caenorhabditis elegans ADAR editing and the ERI-6/7/MOV10 RNAi pathway silence endogenous viral elements and LTR retrotransposons.,"Endogenous retroviruses and long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons are mobile genetic elements that are closely related to retroviruses. Desilenced endogenous retroviruses are associated with human autoimmune disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. Caenorhabditis elegans and related Caenorhabditis spp. contain LTR retrotransposons and, as described here, numerous integrated viral genes including viral envelope genes that are part of LTR retrotransposons. We found that both LTR retrotransposons and endogenous viral elements are silenced by ADARs [adenosine deaminases acting on double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)] together with the endogenous RNA interference (RNAi) factor ERI-6/7, a homolog of MOV10 helicase, a retrotransposon and retrovirus restriction factor in human. siRNAs corresponding to integrated viral genes and LTR retrotransposons, but not to DNA transposons, are dependent on the ADARs and ERI-6/7. siRNAs corresponding to palindromic repeats are independent of the ADARs and ERI-6/7, and are in fact increased in adar- and eri-6/7-defective mutants because of an antiviral RNAi response to dsRNA. Silencing of LTR retrotransposons is dependent on downstream RNAi factors and P granule components but is independent of the viral sensor DRH-1/RIG-I and the nuclear Argonaute NRDE-3. The activation of retrotransposons in the ADAR- and ERI-6/7/MOV10-defective mutant is associated with the induction of the unfolded protein response (UPR), a common response to viral infection. The overlap between genes induced upon viral infection and infection with intracellular pathogens and genes coexpressed with retrotransposons suggests that there is a common response to different types of foreign elements that includes a response to proteotoxicity presumably caused by the burden of replicating pathogens and expressed retrotransposons.",2020 Mar 17,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2020 Mar 17;117(11):5987-5996. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1919028117.

Here we found that adding R-2HG or the mutant IDH1 R132H could promote PCa cell invasion in androgen receptor (AR)-negative PC3 cells or suppressing the AR in AR-positive C4-2 cells. Mechanism dissection revealed that R-2HG could increase circRNA-51217 expression to sponge miRNA-646, which might then lead to increase TGFβ1 expression and thus induce TGFβ1/p-Smad2/3 signaling to increase PCa cell invasion. AR can suppress this R-2HG/circRNA-51217/miRNA-646/TGFβ1/p-Smad2/3 signaling-increased PCa cell invasion via repressing TGFβ1 transcription and inhibiting circRNA-51217 expression through regulating ADAR2 expression. Preclinical studies with an in vivo xenograft mouse model also revealed that PCa cells with the IDH1 R132H mutation have more invasive metastasis. This study demonstrates that IDH1 R132H mutation with increased oncometabolite R-2HG in PCa cells may play important roles to increase PCa cell invasion.",2020 Mar 1,Cancer Lett. 2020 Mar 1;472:151-164. doi: 10.1016/j.canlet.2019.12.014.

31651955,A Bayesian Framework for Inferring the Influence of Sequence Context on Point Mutations.,"The probability of point mutations is expected to be highly influenced by the flanking nucleotides that surround them, known as the sequence context. This phenomenon may be mainly attributed to the enzyme that modifies or mutates the genetic material, because most enzymes tend to have specific sequence contexts that dictate their activity. Here, we develop a statistical model that allows for the detection and evaluation of the effects of different sequence contexts on mutation rates from deep population sequencing data. This task is computationally challenging, as the complexity of the model increases exponentially as the context size increases. We established our novel Bayesian method based on sparse model selection methods, with the leading assumption that the number of actual sequence contexts that directly influence mutation rates is minuscule compared with the number of possible sequence contexts. We show that our method is highly accurate on simulated data using pentanucleotide contexts, even when accounting for noisy data. We next analyze empirical population sequencing data from polioviruses and HIV-1 and detect a significant enrichment in sequence contexts associated with deamination by the cellular deaminases ADAR 1/2 and APOBEC3G, respectively. In the current era, where next-generation sequencing data are highly abundant, our approach can be used on any population sequencing data to reveal context-dependent base alterations and may assist in the discovery of novel mutable sites or editing sites.",2020 Mar 1,Mol Biol Evol. 2020 Mar 1;37(3):893-903. doi: 10.1093/molbev/msz248.,"['Ling G', 'Miller D', 'Nielsen R', 'Stern A']",False
31968217,Fluoxetine improves behavioural deficits induced by chronic alcohol treatment by alleviating RNA editing of 5-HT(2C) receptors.,"The alcoholism and major depressive disorder are common comorbidity, with alcohol-induced depressive symptoms being eased by selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), although the mechanisms underlying pathology and therapy are poorly understood. Chronic alcohol consumption affects the activity of serotonin 2C receptors (5-HT(2C)R) by regulating adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) in neurons. Astrogliopathic changes contribute to alcohol addiction, while decreased release of ATP from astrocytes can trigger depressive-like behaviours in mice. In this study, we discovered that chronic alcohol treatment increased editing of RNA of 5-HT(2C)R via up-regulating the expression of ADAR2, consequently reducing the release of ATP from astrocytes induced by 5-HT(2C)R agonist, MK212. Moreover, SSRI antidepressant fluoxetine decreased the expression of ADAR2 through the transactivation of EGFR/PI3K/AKT/cFos signalling pathway. The increased release of astroglial ATP by MK212 which was suppressed by chronic alcohol consumption, and reduction in ADAR2 activity eliminated the RNA editing of 5-HT(2C)R increased by alcohol in vitro and recovered the release of ATP from astrocytes induced by MK212. Meanwhile, fluoxetine improved the behavioural and motor symptoms induced by alcohol addiction and decreased the alcohol intake. Our study suggests that the astrocytic 5-HT(2C)R contribute to alcohol addiction; fluoxetine thus can be used to alleviate depression, treat alcohol addiction and improve motor coordination.",2020 Mar,Neurochem Int. 2020 Mar;134:104689. doi: 10.1016/j.neuint.2020.104689.

Causation and mechanisms are currently under investigation. Induction of an early life seizure by kainic acid (KA) in immature rats on post-natal day (P) 7 results in behavioral changes in the adult rat that reflect social and intellectual deficits without overt cellular damage. Our previous work also demonstrated increased expression of CA1 hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and reduced desensitization of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid-type ionotropic glutamate receptors (AMPA-R) one week following a kainic acid induced seizure (KA-ELS). Here we used RNA sequencing (RNAseq) of mRNA from dorsal hippocampal CA1 to probe changes in mRNA levels one week following KA-ELS as a means to investigate the mechanisms for these functional changes. Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) confirmed our previous results by predicting an up-regulation of the synaptic LTP pathway. Differential gene expression results revealed significant differences in 7 gene isoforms. Additional assessments included AMPA-R splice variants and adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 2 (ADAR2) editing sites as a means to determine the mechanism for reduced AMPA-R desensitization. Splice variant analysis demonstrated that KA-ELS result in a small, but significant decrease in the ""flop"" isoform of Gria3, and editing site analysis revealed significant changes in the editing of a kainate receptor subunit, Grik2, and a serotonin receptor, Htr2c. While these specific changes may not account for altered AMPA-R desensitization, the differences indicate that KA-ELS alters gene expression in the hippocampal CA1 one week after the insult.",2020 Mar,Epilepsy Res. 2020 Mar;161:106283. doi: 10.1016/j.eplepsyres.2020.106283.

31793005,Regulatory T cells and co-evolution of allele-specific MHC recognition by the TCR.,"What is the evolutionary mechanism for the TCR-MHC-conserved interaction? We extend Dembic's model (Dembic Z. In, Scand J Immunol e12806, 2019) of thymus positive selection for high-avidity anti-self-MHC Tregs among double (CD4 + CD8+)-positive (DP) developing thymocytes. This model is based on competition for self-MHC (+ Pep) complexes presented on cortical epithelium. Such T cells exit as CD4 + CD25+FoxP3 + thymic-derived Tregs (tTregs). The other positively selected DP T cells are then negatively selected on medulla epithelium removing high-avidity anti-self-MHC + Pep as T cells commit to CD4 + or CD8 + lineages. The process is likened to the competitive selection and affinity maturation in Germinal Centre for the somatic hypermutation (SHM) of rearranged immunoglobulin (Ig) variable region (V[D]Js) of centrocytes bearing antigen-specific B cell receptors (BCR). We now argue that the same direct SHM processes for TCRs occur in post-antigenic Germinal Centres, but now occurring in peripheral pTregs. This model provides a potential solution to a long-standing problem previously recognized by Cohn and others (Cohn M, Anderson CC, Dembic Z. In, Scand J Immunol e12790, 2019) of how co-evolution occurs of species-specific MHC alleles with the repertoire of their germline TCR V counterparts. We suggest this is not by 'blind', slow, and random Darwinian natural selection events, but a rapid structured somatic selection vertical transmission process. The pTregs bearing somatic TCR V mutant genes then, on arrival in reproductive tissues, can donate their TCR V sequences via soma-to-germline feedback as discussed in this journal earlier.

31996844,Investigating RNA editing in deep transcriptome datasets with REDItools and REDIportal.,"RNA editing is a widespread post-transcriptional mechanism able to modify transcripts through insertions/deletions or base substitutions. It is prominent in mammals, in which millions of adenosines are deaminated to inosines by members of the ADAR family of enzymes. A-to-I RNA editing has a plethora of biological functions, but its detection in large-scale transcriptome datasets is still an unsolved computational task. To this aim, we developed REDItools, the first software package devoted to the RNA editing profiling in RNA-sequencing (RNAseq) data. It has been successfully used in human transcriptomes, proving the tissue and cell type specificity of RNA editing as well as its pervasive nature. Outcomes from large-scale REDItools analyses on human RNAseq data have been collected in our specialized REDIportal database, containing more than 4.5 million events.

31999481,AKT-Dependent Phosphorylation of ADAR1p110 and ADAR2 Represents a New and Important Link Between Cell Signaling and RNA Editing.,"RNA editing is a process by which nascent RNA transcripts are covalently modified, thus enhancing the complexity of the transcriptome. The most common modifications are deaminations of adenosine to inosine at sites of complex RNA secondary structure, a process that is carried out by the adenosine deaminase acting on double-strand RNA (ADAR) family of RNA editases. Although much has been learned about the ADAR family members since their discovery, very little information on their post-transcriptional regulation has been reported. Similar to most proteins, the ADAR family members are post-translationally modified at multiple sites. We recently reported that members of the AKT kinase family directly phosphorylate ADAR1p110 and ADAR2 on a conserved threonine within the catalytic domain of the protein. Phosphorylation was observed to differentially inhibit the enzymatic activity of the ADAR proteins toward known RNA substrates. The direct downstream involvement of the AKT kinases in multiple major signaling pathways associated with cell survival, growth, glucose metabolism (insulin signaling), and differentiation is well established; thus, the AKT kinases represent a link between ADAR-dependent A-to-I editing and major signal transduction pathways that are necessary for cell maintenance and development.",2020 Mar,DNA Cell Biol. 2020 Mar;39(3):343-348. doi: 10.1089/dna.2020.5351.

RESULTS: Transfection of siRNA against ADAR2 suppressed proliferation, motility, and invasiveness of MPM cells expressing both ADAR1 and ADAR2; however, siRNA against ADAR1 did not affect these cellular activities. Overexpression of ADAR2, that was incapable of binding to RNA, suppressed growth, motility, and invasion of MPM cells. However, overexpression of ADAR2 that had no enzyme activity did not alter the malignant properties of MPM cells.

32575694,Suppression of Nonsense Mutations by New Emerging Technologies.,"Nonsense mutations often result from single nucleotide substitutions that change a sense codon (coding for an amino acid) to a nonsense or premature termination codon (PTC) within the coding region of a gene. The impact of nonsense mutations is two-fold: (1) the PTC-containing mRNA is degraded by a surveillance pathway called nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) and (2) protein translation stops prematurely at the PTC codon, and thus no functional full-length protein is produced. As such, nonsense mutations result in a large number of human diseases. Nonsense suppression is a strategy that aims to correct the defects of hundreds of genetic disorders and reverse disease phenotypes and conditions. While most clinical trials have been performed with small molecules, there is an increasing need for sequence-specific repair approaches that are safer and adaptable to personalized medicine. Here, we discuss recent advances in both conventional strategies as well as new technologies.

However, RNA editing in cell lines behaves very differently than in normal and diseased tissues, and most cell lines exhibit low editing levels, requiring over-expression of the enzymes. Here, we explore the A-to-I RNA editing landscape across over 1000 human cell lines types and show that for almost every editing target of interest a suitable cell line that mimics normal tissue condition may be found. We provide CLAIRE, a searchable catalogue of RNA editing levels across cell lines available at http://srv00.recas.ba.infn.it/atlas/claire.html, to facilitate rational choice of appropriate cell lines for future work on A-to-I RNA editing.",2020 Jun 19,Nucleic Acids Res. 2020 Jun 19;48(11):5849-5858. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkaa305.,"['Schaffer AA', 'Kopel E', 'Hendel A', 'Picardi E', 'Levanon EY', 'Eisenberg E']",True

Although APOBEC-mediated C>U editing has been associated with a number of human cancers, the extent of C>U editing in human disease remains unclear. Here, we performed an association study and found that at least 1293 human disease variants occur at sites predicted by sequence motif analysis (RNASee protocol) to undergo APOBEC3A/G C>U editing. These variants were associated with a wide array of human disease conditions ranging from cancer, metabolic disorders, retinopathies, cardiomyopathies, neurodegenerative disorders and immunodeficiencies.

32367065,Dynamic regulation of Z-DNA in the mouse prefrontal cortex by the RNA-editing enzyme Adar1 is required for fear extinction.,"DNA forms conformational states beyond the right-handed double helix; however, the functional relevance of these noncanonical structures in the brain remains unknown. Here we show that, in the prefrontal cortex of mice, the formation of one such structure, Z-DNA, is involved in the regulation of extinction memory. Z-DNA is formed during fear learning and reduced during extinction learning, which is mediated, in part, by a direct interaction between Z-DNA and the RNA-editing enzyme Adar1. Adar1 binds to Z-DNA during fear extinction learning, which leads to a reduction in Z-DNA at sites where Adar1 is recruited. Knockdown of Adar1 leads to an inability to modify a previously acquired fear memory and blocks activity-dependent changes in DNA structure and RNA state-effects that are fully rescued by the introduction of full-length Adar1. These findings suggest a new mechanism of learning-induced gene regulation that is dependent on proteins that recognize alternate DNA structure states, which are required for memory flexibility.",2020 Jun,Nat Neurosci. 2020 Jun;23(6):718-729. doi: 10.1038/s41593-020-0627-5.

32596459,Suppression of adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editome by death associated protein 3 (DAP3) promotes cancer progression.,"RNA editing introduces nucleotide changes in RNA sequences. Recent studies have reported that aberrant A-to-I RNA editing profiles are implicated in cancers. Albeit changes in expression and activity of ADAR genes are thought to have been responsible for the dysregulated RNA editome in diseases, they are not always correlated, indicating the involvement of secondary regulators. Here, we uncover DAP3 as a potent repressor of editing and a strong oncogene in cancer. DAP3 mainly interacts with the deaminase domain of ADAR2 and represses editing via disrupting association of ADAR2 with its target transcripts. PDZD7, an exemplary DAP3-repressed editing target, undergoes a protein recoding editing at stop codon [Stop →Trp (W)]. Because of editing suppression by DAP3, the unedited PDZD7(WT), which is more tumorigenic than edited PDZD7(Stop518W), is accumulated in tumors. In sum, cancer cells may acquire malignant properties for their survival advantage through suppressing RNA editome by DAP3.",2020 Jun,Sci Adv. 2020 Jun 17;6(25):eaba5136. doi: 10.1126/sciadv.aba5136. eCollection 2020 Jun.,"['Han J', 'An O', 'Hong H', 'Chan THM', 'Song Y', 'Shen H', 'Tang SJ', 'Lin JS', 'Ng VHE', 'Tay DJT', 'Molias FB', 'Pitcheshwar P', 'Tan HQ', 'Yang H', 'Chen L']",True
32596474,Evidence for host-dependent RNA editing in the transcriptome of SARS-CoV-2.,"The COVID-19 outbreak has become a global health risk, and understanding the response of the host to the SARS-CoV-2 virus will help to combat the disease. RNA editing by host deaminases is an innate restriction process to counter virus infection, but it is not yet known whether this process operates against coronaviruses. Here, we analyze RNA sequences from bronchoalveolar lavage fluids obtained from coronavirus-infected patients. We identify nucleotide changes that may be signatures of RNA editing: adenosine-to-inosine changes from ADAR deaminases and cytosine-to-uracil changes from APOBEC deaminases. Mutational analysis of genomes from different strains of Coronaviridae from human hosts reveals mutational patterns consistent with those observed in the transcriptomic data. However, the reduced ADAR signature in these data raises the possibility that ADARs might be more effective than APOBECs in restricting viral propagation. Our results thus suggest that both APOBECs and ADARs are involved in coronavirus genome editing, a process that may shape the fate of both virus and patient.",2020 Jun,Sci Adv. 2020 Jun 17;6(25):eabb5813. doi: 10.1126/sciadv.abb5813. eCollection 2020 Jun.,"['Di Giorgio S', 'Martignano F', 'Torcia MG', 'Mattiuz G', 'Conticello SG']",False

Great attention has been given to the study of the molecular mechanism underpinning MDD at the genetic, epigenetic and proteomic level. However, the importance of RNA modifications has attracted little attention until now in this field. RNA molecules are extensively and dynamically altered by a variety of mechanisms. Similar to ""epigenomic"" changes, which modify DNA structure or histones, RNA alterations are now termed ""epitranscriptomic"" changes and have been predicted to have profound consequences for gene expression and cellular functionality. Two of these modifications, adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing and m6A methylations, have fascinated researchers over the last years, showing a new level of complexity in gene expression.

The expression of these receptors on the ocular surface is unknown. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Gene expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptors was investigated in conjunctival epithelial cell samples and in ex-vivo cornea samples using microarray or transcriptome sequencing. RESULTS: ACE2 is expressed in conjunctival samples at a low level, while BSG and TMPRSS2 are expressed at intermediate levels in both conjunctiva and cornea. Other receptors such as ANPEP, AGTR2 are expressed at low level in the conjunctiva. Two RNA editing enzymes involved in antiviral responses, APOBEC3A, and ADAR-1 were also highly expressed.

CLIP and TRIBE detected β-actin, albeit with false-positives. False-positive CLIP signals were attributed to nonspecific antibody interactions. In contrast, putative false-positive TRIBE targets were genes spatially proximal to the β-actin gene. MCP-ADAR edited nearby nascent transcripts consistent with interchromosomal contacts observed in Hi-C. The identification of nascent contacts implies RNA regulatory proteins (e.g., splicing factors) associated with multiple nascent transcripts, forming domains of post-transcriptional activity.

32668759,Development of a Single Construct System for Site-Directed RNA Editing Using MS2-ADAR.,"Site-directed RNA editing (SDRE) technologies have great potential for treating genetic diseases caused by point mutations. Our group and other researchers have developed SDRE methods utilizing adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) and guide RNAs recruiting ADARs to target RNAs bearing point mutations. In general, efficient SDRE relies on introducing numerous guide RNAs relative to target genes. However, achieving a large ratio is not possible for gene therapy applications. In order to achieve a realistic ratio, we herein developed a system that can introduce an equal number of genes and guide RNAs into cultured cells using a fusion protein comprising an ADAR fragment and a plasmid vector containing one copy of each gene on a single construct. We transfected the single construct into HEK293T cells and achieved relatively high efficiency (up to 42%). The results demonstrate that efficient SDRE is possible when the copy number is similar for all three factors (target gene, guide RNA, and ADAR enzyme).

32652930,Detecting fitness epistasis in recently admixed populations with genome-wide data.,"BACKGROUND: Fitness epistasis, the interaction effect of genes at different loci on fitness, makes an important contribution to adaptive evolution. Although fitness interaction evidence has been observed in model organisms, it is more difficult to detect and remains poorly understood in human populations as a result of limited statistical power and experimental constraints. Fitness epistasis is inferred from non-independence between unlinked loci. We previously observed ancestral block correlation between chromosomes 4 and 6 in African Americans. The same approach fails when examining ancestral blocks on the same chromosome due to the strong confounding effect observed in a recently admixed population. RESULTS: We developed a novel approach to eliminate the bias caused by admixture linkage disequilibrium when searching for fitness epistasis on the same chromosome. We applied this approach in 16,252 unrelated African Americans and identified significant ancestral correlations in two pairs of genomic regions (P-value< 8.11 × 10(- 7)) on chromosomes 1 and 10. The ancestral correlations were not explained by population admixture. Historical African-European crossover events are reduced between pairs of epistatic regions. We observed multiple pairs of co-expressed genes shared by the two regions on each chromosome, including ADAR being co-expressed with IFI44 in almost all tissues and DARC being co-expressed with VCAM1, S1PR1 and ELTD1 in multiple tissues in the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) data. Moreover, the co-expressed gene pairs are associated with the same diseases/traits in the GWAS Catalog, such as white blood cell count, blood pressure, lung function, inflammatory bowel disease and educational attainment.

31772029,Cardiac valve involvement in ADAR-related type I interferonopathy.,"BACKGROUND: Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADAR) mutations cause a spectrum of neurological phenotypes ranging from severe encephalopathy (Aicardi-Goutières syndrome) to isolated spastic paraplegia and are associated with enhanced type I interferon signalling. In children, non-neurological involvement in the type I interferonopathies includes autoimmune and rheumatological phenomena, with calcifying cardiac valve disease only previously reported in the context of MDA5 gain-of-function. RESULTS: We describe three patients with biallelic ADAR mutations who developed calcifying cardiac valvular disease in late childhood (9.5-14 years). Echocardiography revealed progressive calcification of the valvular leaflets resulting in valvular stenosis and incompetence. Two patients became symptomatic with biventricular failure after 5-6.5 years. In one case, disease progressed to severe cardiac failure despite maximal medical management, with death occurring at 17 years. Another child received mechanical mitral and aortic valve replacement at 16 years with good postoperative outcome. Histological examination of the affected valves showed fibrosis and calcification. CONCLUSIONS: Type I interferonopathies of differing genetic aetiology demonstrate an overlapping phenotypic spectrum which includes calcifying cardiac valvular disease. Individuals with ADAR-related type I interferonopathy may develop childhood-onset multivalvular stenosis and incompetence which can progress insidiously to symptomatic, and ultimately fatal, cardiac failure.

In this study, we performed mutation analysis on a family that included typical DSH patients. No mutations were found in any coding regions or exon-intron boundary regions of ADAR1, but a previously unreported non-coding heterozygous variant, c.-60A>G, was found in the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) of ADAR1 in the proband and her mother. The function of 5'UTR in mRNA is not well-understood. To understand the pathogenesis of the variant and the function of the 5'UTR of ADAR1, we constructed two reporter genes carrying the ADAR1 5'UTR sequence with/without the variant between the PGK promoter and a luciferase coding sequence, and performed luciferase assays, semi-quantitative PCR analyses, and polysomal assays. In human melanocytes, c.-60A>G induced a 16% reduction in transcription and a 51% reduction in translation. Our results indicate that the 5'UTR c.-60A>G variant adversely affects the post-transcriptional step in gene expression, leading to DSH. Detailed functional assays of the 5'UTR of ADAR1 in the present study revealed the gene expression to be not only downregulated, but also upregulated by defects in 5'UTR depending on the locations.

The editing of nuclear protein-coding transcripts has long been known in metazoans, but was only recently detected in fungi. In contrast to many metazoan species, fungal editing sites occur mostly in coding regions, and therefore, fungal editing can change protein sequences and lead to modified or new functions of proteins. Indeed, mRNA editing is thought to be generally adaptive on fungi. Although RNA editing has been detected in both, Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, there seem to be considerable differences between these two classes of fungi concerning the types, the timing, and the purpose of editing. This review summarizes the characteristics of RNA editing in fungi and compares them to metazoan species and bacteria. In particular, it will review cellular processes affected by editing and speculate on the purpose of editing for fungal biology with a focus on the filamentous ascomycetes.

32603639,What do editors do? Understanding the physiological functions of A-to-I RNA editing by adenosine deaminase acting on RNAs.,"Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing is a post-transcriptional modification of RNA which changes its sequence, coding potential and secondary structure. Catalysed by the adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) proteins, ADAR1 and ADAR2, A-to-I editing occurs at approximately 50 000-150 000 sites in mice and into the millions of sites in humans. The vast majority of A-to-I editing occurs in repetitive elements, accounting for the discrepancy in total numbers of sites between species. The species-conserved primary role of editing by ADAR1 in mammals is to suppress innate immune activation by unedited cell-derived endogenous RNA. In the absence of editing, inverted paired sequences, such as Alu elements, are thought to form stable double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) structures which trigger activation of dsRNA sensors, such as MDA5. A small subset of editing sites are within coding sequences and are evolutionarily conserved across metazoans. Editing by ADAR2 has been demonstrated to be physiologically important for recoding of neurotransmitter receptors in the brain. Furthermore, changes in RNA editing are associated with various pathological states, from the severe autoimmune disease Aicardi-Goutières syndrome, to various neurodevelopmental and psychiatric conditions and cancer. However, does detection of an editing site imply functional importance? Genetic studies in humans and genetically modified mouse models together with evolutionary genomics have begun to clarify the roles of A-to-I editing in vivo.

Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) is tightly associated with cancer development and progression. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of ADAR1 in the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 and SK-BR-3 breast cancer cell lines after 8-Cl-Ado exposure and its possible mechanisms. After 8-Cl-Ado exposure, CCK-8 assay was performed to determine the cell proliferation; flow cytometry was used to analyze the cell cycle profiles and apoptosis; and the protein levels of ADAR1, p53, p21, and cyclin D1 were measured by western blotting. The results showed that the cell proliferation was greatly inhibited, G1 cell cycle was arrested, and apoptosis was induced after 8-Cl-Ado exposure. ADAR1 and cyclin D1 protein levels were dramatically decreased, while p53 and p21 levels were increased after 8-Cl-Ado exposure. Moreover, the cell growth inhibition was rescued, apoptosis was reduced, and p53 and p21 protein levels were downregulated, while cyclin D1 was upregulated when cells were transfected with plasmids expressing ADAR1 proteins. More importantly, RNA-binding domain of ADAR1 is critical to the cell growth inhibition of breast cancer cells exposed to 8-Cl-Ado. Together, 8-Cl-Ado inhibits the cell proliferation, induces G1 phase arrest and apoptosis at least by targeting ADAR1/p53/p21 signaling pathway.

Here, we applied in situ sequencing to distinguish between edited and unedited transcripts in distinct regions of the mouse brain at four developmental stages, and investigate the diversity of the RNA landscape. RESULTS: We analyzed RNA editing at codon-altering sites using in situ sequencing at single-cell resolution, in combination with the detection of individual ADAR enzymes and specific cell type marker transcripts. This approach revealed cell-type-specific regulation of RNA editing of a set of transcripts, and developmental and regional variation in editing levels for many of the targeted sites. We found increasing editing diversity throughout development, which arises through regional- and cell type-specific regulation of ADAR enzymes and target transcripts.

Neural crest specific conditional deletion of Adar1 in mice leads to global depigmentation and absence of myelin from peripheral nerves, resulting from alterations in melanocyte survival and differentiation of Schwann cells, respectively. Upregulation of interferon stimulated genes precedes these defects, which are associated with the triggering of a signature resembling response to injury in peripheral nerves. Simultaneous extinction of MDA5, a key sensor of unedited RNA, rescues both melanocytes and myelin defects in vitro, suggesting that ADAR1 safeguards neural crest derivatives from aberrant MDA5-mediated interferon production.

31648945,Structural analyses of inositol phosphate second messengers bound to signaling effector proteins.,"The higher-order inositol phosphate second messengers inositol tetrakisphosphate (IP4), inositol pentakisphosphate (IP5) and inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) are important signaling molecules that regulate DNA-damage repair, cohesin dynamics, RNA-editing, retroviral assembly, nuclear transport, phosphorylation, acetylation, crotonylation, and ubiquitination. This functional diversity has made understanding how inositol polyphosphates regulate cellular processes challenging to dissect. However, some inositol phosphates have been unexpectedly found in X-ray crystal structures, occasionally revealing structural and mechanistic details of effector protein regulation before functional consequences have been described. This review highlights a sampling of crystal structures describing the interaction between inositol phosphates and protein effectors. This list includes the RNA editing enzyme ""adenosine deaminase that acts on RNA 2"" (ADAR2), the Pds5B regulator of cohesin dynamics, the class 1 histone deacetylases (HDACs) HDAC1 and HDAC3, and the PH domain of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk). One of the most important enzymes responsible for higher-order inositol phosphate synthesis is inositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK), which plays dual roles in both inositol and phosphoinositide signaling. Structures of phosphoinositide lipid binding proteins have also revealed new aspects of protein effector regulation, as mediated by the nuclear receptors Steroidogenic Factor-1 (SF-1, NR5A2) and Liver Receptor Homolog-1 (LRH-1, NR5A2). Together, these studies underscore the structural diversity in binding interactions between effector proteins and inositol phosphate small signaling molecules, and further support that detailed structural studies can lead to new biological discovery.",2020 Jan,Adv Biol Regul. 2020 Jan;75:100667. doi: 10.1016/j.jbior.2019.100667.

31493964,Increased adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing in rheumatoid arthritis.,"OBJECTIVE: Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing of Alu retroelements is a primate-specific mechanism mediated by adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) that diversifies transcriptome by changing selected nucleotides in RNA molecules. We tested the hypothesis that A-to-I RNA editing is altered in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: Synovium expression analysis of ADAR1 was investigated in 152 RA patients and 50 controls. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived from 14 healthy subjects and 19 patients with active RA at baseline and after 12-week treatment were examined for ADAR1p150 and ADAR1p110 isoform expression by RT-qPCR. RNA editing activity was analysed by AluSx(+) Sanger-sequencing of cathepsin S, an extracellular matrix degradation enzyme involved in antigen presentation. RESULTS: ADAR1 was significantly over-expressed in RA synovium regardless of disease duration. Similarly, ADAR1p150 isoform expression was significantly increased in the blood of active RA patients. Individual nucleotide analysis revealed that A-to-I RNA editing rate was also significantly increased in RA patients. Both baseline ADAR1p150 expression and individual adenosine RNA editing rate of cathepsin S AluSx(+) decreased after treatment only in those patients with good clinical response. Upregulation of the expression and/or activity of the RNA editing machinery were associated with a higher expression of edited Alu-enriched genes including cathepsin S and TNF receptor-associated factors 1,2,3 and 5. CONCLUSION: A previously unrecognized regulation and role of ADAR1p150-mediated A-to-I RNA editing in post-transcriptional control in RA underpins therapeutic response and fuels inflammatory gene expression, thus representing an interesting therapeutic target.",2020 Jan,J Autoimmun. 2020 Jan;106:102329. doi: 10.1016/j.jaut.2019.102329.

Here, we present evidence in a T-cell-specific gene knockout mouse model that ADAR1 is required for early T cell development. Loss of ADAR1 led to cell death of the progenitors at the double negative stage and prevented T cell maturation in the thymus. Furthermore, ADAR1 deletion in pre-T cells preferentially affected TCRβ-expressing cells causing TCRβ positive cell depletion. Interruption of IFN signaling occurred in the premature T cells, indicating a role of IFN signaling in the survival of TCRβ-expressing cells regulated by ADAR1. This study demonstrated an essential role for the RNA editing enzyme ADAR1 as a potential regulator for T-cell fate determination during clonal selection, which, in turn, contributes to immunologic homeostasis.",2020 Jan,Blood Sci. 2020 Jan 16;2(1):27-32. doi: 10.1097/BS9.0000000000000039. eCollection 2020 Jan.,"['Xufeng R', 'Nie D', 'Yang Q', 'Wang W', 'Cheng T', 'Wang Q']",True
31320745,Mendelian disease caused by variants affecting recognition of Z-DNA and Z-RNA by the Zα domain of the double-stranded RNA editing enzyme ADAR.,"Variants in the human double-stranded RNA editing enzyme ADAR produce three well-characterized rare Mendelian Diseases: Dyschromatosis Symmetrica Hereditaria (OMIM: 127400), Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (OMIM: 615010) and Bilateral Striatal Necrosis/Dystonia. ADAR encodes p150 and p110 protein isoforms. p150 incorporates the Zα domain that binds left-handed Z-DNA and Z-RNA with high affinity through contact of highly conserved residues with the DNA and RNA double helix. In certain individuals, frameshift variants on one parental chromosome in the second exon of ADAR produce haploinsufficiency of p150 while maintaining normal expression of p110. In other individuals, loss of p150 expression from one chromosome allows mapping of Zα p150 variants from the other parental chromosome directly to phenotype. The analysis reveals that loss of function Zα variants cause dysregulation of innate interferon responses to double-stranded RNA. This approach confirms a biological role for the left-handed conformation in human disease, further validating the power of Mendelian genetics to deliver unambiguous answers to difficult questions. The findings reveal that the human genome encodes genetic information using both shape and sequence.",2020 Jan,Eur J Hum Genet. 2020 Jan;28(1):114-117. doi: 10.1038/s41431-019-0458-6.

31559893,Developmental Outcomes of Aicardi Goutières Syndrome.,"Aicardi Goutières syndrome is a monogenic interferonopathy caused by abnormalities in the intracellular nucleic acid sensing machinery (TREX1, RNASEH2A, RNASEH2B, RNASEH2C, SAMHD1, ADAR1, or IFIH1). Most individuals affected by Aicardi Goutières syndrome exhibit some degree of neurologic impairment, from spastic paraparesis with relatively preserved cognition to tetraparesis and severe intellectual disability. Because of this heterogeneity, it is important to fully characterize the developmental trajectory in Aicardi Goutières syndrome. To characterize the clinical presentation in Aicardi Goutières syndrome, early features were collected from an international cohort of children (n = 100) with genetically confirmed Aicardi Goutières syndrome. There was a heterogeneous age of onset, with overlapping clusters of presenting symptoms: altered mental status, systemic inflammatory symptoms, and acute neurologic disability. Next, we created genotype-specific developmental milestone acquisition curves. Individuals with microcephaly or TREX1-related Aicardi Goutières syndrome secondary were the most severely affected and less likely to reach milestones, including head control, sitting, and nonspecific mama/dada. Individuals affected by SAMHD1, IFIH1, and ADAR attained the most advanced milestones, with 44% achieving verbal communication and 31% independently ambulating. Retrospective function scales (Gross Motor Function Classification System, Manual Ability Classification System, and Communication Function Classification System) demonstrated that two-thirds of the Aicardi Goutières syndrome population are severely affected. Our results suggest multifactorial influences on developmental trajectory, including a strong contribution from genotype.

31733589,Recognition of DNA adducts by edited and unedited forms of DNA glycosylase NEIL1.,"Pre-mRNA encoding human NEIL1 undergoes editing by adenosine deaminase ADAR1 that converts a single adenosine to inosine, and this conversion results in an amino acid change of lysine 242 to arginine. Previous investigations of the catalytic efficiencies of the two forms of the enzyme revealed differential release of thymine glycol (ThyGly) from synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides, with the unedited form, NEIL1 K242 being ≈30-fold more efficient than the edited NEIL1 K242R. In contrast, when these enzymes were reacted with oligodeoxynucleotides containing guanidinohydantoin or spiroiminohydantoin, the edited K242R form was ≈3-fold more efficient than the unedited NEIL1. However, no prior studies have investigated the efficiencies of these two forms of NEIL1 on either high-molecular weight DNA containing multiple oxidatively-induced base damages, or oligodeoxynucleotides containing a bulky alkylated formamidopyrimidine. To understand the extent of changes in substrate recognition, γ-irradiated calf thymus DNA was treated with either edited or unedited NEIL1 and the released DNA base lesions analyzed by gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Of all the measured DNA lesions, imidazole ring-opened 4,6-diamino-5-formamidopyrimidine (FapyAde) and 2,6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5-formamidopyrimidine (FapyGua) were preferentially released by both NEIL1 enzymes with K242R being ≈1.3 and 1.2-fold more efficient than K242 on excision of FapyAde and FapyGua, respectively. Consistent with the prior literature, large differences (≈7.5 to 12-fold) were measured in the excision of ThyGly from genomic DNA by the unedited versus edited NEIL1. In contrast, the edited NEIL1 was more efficient (≈3 to 5-fold) on release of 5-hydroxycytosine. Excision kinetics on DNA containing a site-specific aflatoxin B(1)-FapyGua adduct revealed an ≈1.4-fold higher rate by the unedited NEIL1. Molecular modeling provides insight into these differential substrate specificities. The results of this study and in particular, the comparison of substrate specificities of unedited and edited NEIL1 using biologically and clinically important base lesions, are critical for defining its role in preservation of genomic integrity.",2020 Jan,DNA Repair (Amst). 2020 Jan;85:102741. doi: 10.1016/j.dnarep.2019.102741.

32028986,Purifying selection of long dsRNA is the first line of defense against false activation of innate immunity.,"BACKGROUND: Mobile elements comprise a large fraction of metazoan genomes. Accumulation of mobile elements is bound to produce multiple putative double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) structures within the transcriptome. These endogenous dsRNA structures resemble viral RNA and may trigger false activation of the innate immune response, leading to severe damage to the host cell. Adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing is a common post-transcriptional modification, abundant within repetitive elements of all metazoans. It was recently shown that a key function of A-to-I RNA editing by ADAR1 is to suppress the immunogenic response by endogenous dsRNAs. RESULTS: Here, we analyze the transcriptomes of dozens of species across the Metazoa and identify a strong genomic selection against endogenous dsRNAs, resulting in their purification from the canonical transcriptome. This purifying selection is especially strong for long and nearly perfect dsRNAs. These are almost absent from mRNAs, but not pre-mRNAs, supporting the notion of selection due to cytoplasmic processes. The few long and nearly perfect structures found in human transcripts are weakly expressed and often heavily edited. CONCLUSION: Purifying selection of long dsRNA is an important defense mechanism against false activation of innate immunity. This newly identified principle governs the integration of mobile elements into the genome, a major driving force of genome evolution. Furthermore, we find that most ADAR1 activity is not required to prevent an immune response to endogenous dsRNAs. The critical targets of ADAR1 editing are, likely, to be found mostly in non-canonical transcripts.",2020 Feb 7,Genome Biol. 2020 Feb 7;21(1):26. doi: 10.1186/s13059-020-1937-3.,"['Barak M', 'Porath HT', 'Finkelstein G', 'Knisbacher BA', 'Buchumenski I', 'Roth SH', 'Levanon EY', 'Eisenberg E']",True
32034135,Cis- and trans-regulations of pre-mRNA splicing by RNA editing enzymes influence cancer development.,"RNA editing and splicing are the two major processes that dynamically regulate human transcriptome diversity. Despite growing evidence of crosstalk between RNA editing enzymes (mainly ADAR1) and splicing machineries, detailed mechanistic explanations and their biological importance in diseases, such as cancer are still lacking. Herein, we identify approximately a hundred high-confidence splicing events altered by ADAR1 and/or ADAR2, and ADAR1 or ADAR2 protein can regulate cassette exons in both directions. We unravel a binding tendency of ADARs to dsRNAs that involves GA-rich sequences for editing and splicing regulation. ADAR1 edits an intronic splicing silencer, leading to recruitment of SRSF7 and repression of exon inclusion. We also present a mechanism through which ADAR2 binds to dsRNA formed between GA-rich sequences and polypyrimidine (Py)-tract and precludes access of U2AF65 to 3' splice site. Furthermore, we find these ADARs-regulated splicing changes per se influence tumorigenesis, not merely byproducts of ADARs editing and binding.",2020 Feb 7,Nat Commun. 2020 Feb 7;11(1):799. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-14621-5.,"['Tang SJ', 'Shen H', 'An O', 'Hong H', 'Li J', 'Song Y', 'Han J', 'Tay DJT', 'Ng VHE', 'Bellido Molias F', 'Leong KW', 'Pitcheshwar P', 'Yang H', 'Chen L']",True
31852792,ADAR2 Is Involved in Self and Nonself Recognition of Borna Disease Virus Genomic RNA in the Nucleus.,"Cells sense pathogen-derived double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) as nonself. To avoid autoimmune activation by self dsRNA, cells utilize A-to-I editing by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) to disrupt dsRNA structures. Considering that viruses have evolved to exploit host machinery, A-to-I editing could benefit innate immune evasion by viruses. Borna disease virus (BoDV), a nuclear-replicating RNA virus, may require escape from nonself RNA-sensing and immune responses to establish persistent infection in the nucleus; however, the strategy by which BoDV evades nonself recognition is unclear. Here, we evaluated the involvement of ADARs in BoDV infection. The infection efficiency of BoDV was markedly decreased in both ADAR1 and ADAR2 knockdown cells at the early phase of infection. Microarray analysis using ADAR2 knockdown cells revealed that ADAR2 reduces immune responses even in the absence of infection. Knockdown of ADAR2 but not ADAR1 significantly reduced the spread and titer of BoDV in infected cells. Furthermore, ADAR2 knockout decreased the infection efficiency of BoDV, and overexpression of ADAR2 rescued the reduced infectivity in ADAR2 knockdown cells. However, the growth of influenza A virus, which causes acute infection in the nucleus, was not affected by ADAR2 knockdown. Moreover, ADAR2 bound to BoDV genomic RNA and induced A-to-G mutations in the genomes of persistently infected cells. We finally demonstrated that BoDV produced in ADAR2 knockdown cells induces stronger innate immune responses than those produced in wild-type cells. Taken together, our results suggest that BoDV utilizes ADAR2 to edit its genome to appear as ""self"" RNA in order to maintain persistent infection in the nucleus.IMPORTANCE Cells use the editing activity of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA proteins (ADARs) to prevent autoimmune responses induced by self dsRNA, but viruses can exploit this process to their advantage. Borna disease virus (BoDV), a nuclear-replicating RNA virus, must escape nonself RNA sensing by the host to establish persistent infection in the nucleus. We evaluated whether BoDV utilizes ADARs to prevent innate immune induction. ADAR2 plays a key role throughout the BoDV life cycle. ADAR2 knockdown reduced A-to-I editing of BoDV genomic RNA, leading to the induction of a strong innate immune response. These data suggest that BoDV exploits ADAR2 to edit nonself genomic RNA to appear as self RNA for innate immune evasion and establishment of persistent infection.",2020 Feb 28,J Virol. 2020 Feb 28;94(6):e01513-19. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01513-19.

32059717,Membrane and synaptic defects leading to neurodegeneration in Adar mutant Drosophila are rescued by increased autophagy.,"BACKGROUND: In fly brains, the Drosophila Adar (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA) enzyme edits hundreds of transcripts to generate edited isoforms of encoded proteins. Nearly all editing events are absent or less efficient in larvae but increase at metamorphosis; the larger number and higher levels of editing suggest editing is most required when the brain is most complex. This idea is consistent with the fact that Adar mutations affect the adult brain most dramatically. However, it is unknown whether Drosophila Adar RNA editing events mediate some coherent physiological effect. To address this question, we performed a genetic screen for suppressors of Adar mutant defects. Adar(5G1) null mutant flies are partially viable, severely locomotion defective, aberrantly accumulate axonal neurotransmitter pre-synaptic vesicles and associated proteins, and develop an age-dependent vacuolar brain neurodegeneration. RESULTS: A genetic screen revealed suppression of all Adar(5G1) mutant phenotypes tested by reduced dosage of the Tor gene, which encodes a pro-growth kinase that increases translation and reduces autophagy in well-fed conditions. Suppression of Adar(5G1) phenotypes by reduced Tor is due to increased autophagy; overexpression of Atg5, which increases canonical autophagy initiation, reduces aberrant accumulation of synaptic vesicle proteins and suppresses all Adar mutant phenotypes tested. Endosomal microautophagy (eMI) is another Tor-inhibited autophagy pathway involved in synaptic homeostasis in Drosophila. Increased expression of the key eMI protein Hsc70-4 also reduces aberrant accumulation of synaptic vesicle proteins and suppresses all Adar(5G1) mutant phenotypes tested. CONCLUSIONS: These findings link Drosophila Adar mutant synaptic and neurotransmission defects to more general cellular defects in autophagy; presumably, edited isoforms of CNS proteins are required for optimum synaptic response capabilities in the brain during the behaviorally complex adult life stage.",2020 Feb 14,BMC Biol. 2020 Feb 14;18(1):15. doi: 10.1186/s12915-020-0747-0.,"['Khan A', 'Paro S', 'McGurk L', 'Sambrani N', 'Hogg MC', 'Brindle J', 'Pennetta G', 'Keegan LP', ""O'Connell MA""]",True

Here, we find that bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced upregulation of ADAR1 in lung ECs is impaired in aged mice, an animal model with high rates of sepsis and mortality. Endothelial cell-specific ADAR1 knockout (ADAR1(ECKO) ) mice suffer from higher mortality rates, aggravated lung injury, and increased vascular permeability under LPS challenge. In primary ADAR1 knockout ECs, expression of the melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5), a downstream effector of ADAR1, is significantly elevated. MDA5 knockout completely rescues the postnatal offspring death of ADAR1(ECKO) mice.

Therefore, identification of new molecular mechanisms is a pressing need for betterment of GBM patient outcomes. qRT-PCR was used to determine BDNF-AS expression in GBM cells. CCK-8, EdU incorporation, and caspase-3 activity assays were employed to analyze biological functions of BDNF-AS. RIP and RNA pull-down were conducted to detect the interactions among BDNF-AS, ADAR, and p53. Actinomycin D was utilized to examine the stability of p53 mRNA. ChIP and luciferase reporter assays were performed to detect transcriptional activation of BDNF-AS by p53. We found that BDNF-AS was significantly downregulated in GBM cell lines, and its overexpression inhibited GBM cell growth, and promoted apoptosis. Importantly, we illustrated that BDNF-AS coupled with ADAR protein to potentiate stability of p53 mRNA and thus upregulate p53. Interestingly, we further identified p53 as a transcription factor of BDNF-AS, activating transcription of BNDF-AS. This study firstly demonstrated that BDNF-AS acted as a tumor suppressor in GBM and the positive feedback circuit of BDNF-AS/ADAR/p53 served an important mechanism to control GBM proliferation.

32140575,A proposed reverse transcription mechanism for (CAG)n and similar expandable repeats that cause neurological and other diseases.,"The mechanism of (CAG)n repeat generation, and related expandable repeat diseases in non-dividing cells, is currently understood in terms of a DNA template-based DNA repair synthesis process involving hairpin stabilized slippage, local error-prone repair via MutSβ (MSH2-MSH3) hairpin protective stabilization, then nascent strand extension by DNA polymerases-β and -δ. We advance a very similar slipped hairpin-stabilized model involving MSH2-MSH3 with two key differences: the copying template may also be the nascent pre-mRNA with the repair pathway being mediated by the Y-family error-prone enzymes DNA polymerase-η and DNA polymerase-κ acting as reverse transcriptases. We argue that both DNA-based and RNA-based mechanisms could well be activated in affected non-dividing brain cells in vivo. Here, we compare the advantages of the RNA/RT-based model proposed by us as an adjunct to previously proposed models.

33291433,Identification and Spatiotemporal Expression of Adenosine Deaminases Acting on RNA (ADAR) during Earthworm Regeneration: Its Possible Implication in Muscle Redifferentiation.,"Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADAR) catalyze the hydrolytic deamination of adenosine (A) to produce inosine (I) in double-stranded RNA substrates. A-to-I RNA editing has increasingly broad physiological significance in development, carcinogenesis, and environmental adaptation. Perionyx excavatus is an earthworm with potent regenerative potential; it can regenerate the head and tail and is an advantageous model system to investigate the molecular mechanisms of regeneration. During RNA sequencing analysis of P. excavatus regenerates, we identified an ADAR homolog (Pex-ADAR), which led us to examine its spatial and temporal expression to comprehend how Pex-ADAR is linked to regeneration. At first, in domain analysis, we discovered that Pex-ADAR only has one double-stranded RNA-binding domain (dsRBD) and a deaminase domain without a Z-DNA-binding domain (ZBD). In addition, a comparison of the core deaminase domains of Pex-ADAR with those of other ADAR family members indicated that Pex-ADAR comprises the conserved three active-site motifs and a glutamate residue for catalytic activity. Pex-ADAR also shares 11 conserved residues, a characteristic of ADAR1, supporting that Pex-ADAR is a member of ADAR1 class. Its temporal expression was remarkably low in the early stages of regeneration before suddenly increasing at 10 days post amputation (dpa) when diverse cell types and tissues were being regenerated. In situ hybridization of Pex-ADAR messenger RNA (mRNA) indicated that the main expression was observed in regenerating muscle layers and related connective tissues. Taken together, the present results demonstrate that an RNA-editing enzyme, Pex-ADAR, is implicated in muscle redifferentiation during earthworm regeneration.",2020 Dec 5,Biology (Basel). 2020 Dec 5;9(12):448. doi: 10.3390/biology9120448.,"['Yoon YB', 'Yu YS', 'Park BJ', 'Cho SJ', 'Park SC']",False
33396460,"Spontaneous Mutations in HIV-1 Gag, Protease, RT p66 in the First Replication Cycle and How They Appear: Insights from an In Vitro Assay on Mutation Rates and Types.","While drug resistant mutations in HIV-1 are largely credited to its error prone HIV-1 RT, the time point in the infection cycle that these mutations can arise and if they appear spontaneously without selection pressures both remained enigmatic. Many HIV-1 RT mutational in vitro studies utilized reporter genes (LacZ) as a template to investigate these questions, thereby not accounting for the possible contribution of viral codon usage. To address this gap, we investigated HIV-1 RT mutation rates and biases on its own Gag, protease, and RT p66 genes in an in vitro selection pressure free system. We found rare clinical mutations with a general avoidance of crucial functional sites in the background mutations rates for Gag, protease, and RT p66 at 4.71 × 10(-5), 6.03 × 10(-5), and 7.09 × 10(-5) mutations/bp, respectively. Gag and p66 genes showed a large number of 'A to G' mutations. Comparisons with silently mutated p66 sequences showed an increase in mutation rates (1.88 × 10(-4) mutations/bp) and that 'A to G' mutations occurred in regions reminiscent of ADAR neighbor sequence preferences. Mutational free energies of the 'A to G' mutations revealed an avoidance of destabilizing effects, with the natural p66 gene codon usage providing barriers to disruptive amino acid changes.

33375933,Automated Isoform Diversity Detector (AIDD): a pipeline for investigating transcriptome diversity of RNA-seq data.,"BACKGROUND: As the number of RNA-seq datasets that become available to explore transcriptome diversity increases, so does the need for easy-to-use comprehensive computational workflows. Many available tools facilitate analyses of one of the two major mechanisms of transcriptome diversity, namely, differential expression of isoforms due to alternative splicing, while the second major mechanism-RNA editing due to post-transcriptional changes of individual nucleotides-remains under-appreciated. Both these mechanisms play an essential role in physiological and diseases processes, including cancer and neurological disorders. However, elucidation of RNA editing events at transcriptome-wide level requires increasingly complex computational tools, in turn resulting in a steep entrance barrier for labs who are interested in high-throughput variant calling applications on a large scale but lack the manpower and/or computational expertise. RESULTS: Here we present an easy-to-use, fully automated, computational pipeline (Automated Isoform Diversity Detector, AIDD) that contains open source tools for various tasks needed to map transcriptome diversity, including RNA editing events. To facilitate reproducibility and avoid system dependencies, the pipeline is contained within a pre-configured VirtualBox environment. The analytical tasks and format conversions are accomplished via a set of automated scripts that enable the user to go from a set of raw data, such as fastq files, to publication-ready results and figures in one step. A publicly available dataset of Zika virus-infected neural progenitor cells is used to illustrate AIDD's capabilities. CONCLUSIONS: AIDD pipeline offers a user-friendly interface for comprehensive and reproducible RNA-seq analyses. Among unique features of AIDD are its ability to infer RNA editing patterns, including ADAR editing, and inclusion of Guttman scale patterns for time series analysis of such editing landscapes. AIDD-based results show importance of diversity of ADAR isoforms, key RNA editing enzymes linked with the innate immune system and viral infections. These findings offer insights into the potential role of ADAR editing dysregulation in the disease mechanisms, including those of congenital Zika syndrome. Because of its automated all-inclusive features, AIDD pipeline enables even a novice user to easily explore common mechanisms of transcriptome diversity, including RNA editing landscapes.",2020 Dec 30,BMC Bioinformatics. 2020 Dec 30;21(Suppl 18):578. doi: 10.1186/s12859-020-03888-6.,"['Plonski NM', 'Johnson E', 'Frederick M', 'Mercer H', 'Fraizer G', 'Meindl R', 'Casadesus G', 'Piontkivska H']",False
33100268,Distant coupling between RNA editing and alternative splicing of the osmosensitive cation channel Tmem63b.,"Post-transcriptional modifications of pre-mRNAs expand the diversity of proteomes in higher eukaryotes. In the brain, these modifications diversify the functional output of many critical neuronal signal molecules. In this study, we identified a brain-specific A-to-I RNA editing that changed glutamine to arginine (Q/R) at exon 20 and an alternative splicing of exon 4 in Tmem63b, which encodes a ubiquitously expressed osmosensitive cation channel. The channel isoforms lacking exon 4 occurred in ∼80% of Tmem63b mRNAs in the brain but were not detected in other tissues, suggesting a brain-specific splicing. We found that the Q/R editing was catalyzed by Adar2 (Adarb1) and required an editing site complementary sequence located in the proximal 5' end of intron 20. Moreover, the Q/R editing was almost exclusively identified in the splicing isoform lacking exon 4, indicating a coupling between the editing and the splicing. Elimination of the Q/R editing in brain-specific Adar2 knockout mice did not affect the splicing efficiency of exon 4. Furthermore, transfection with the splicing isoform containing exon 4 suppressed the Q/R editing in primary cultured cerebellar granule neurons. Thus, our study revealed a coupling between an RNA editing and a distant alternative splicing in the Tmem63b pre-mRNA, in which the splicing plays a dominant role. Finally, physiological analysis showed that the splicing and the editing coordinately regulate Ca(2+) permeability and osmosensitivity of channel proteins, which may contribute to their functions in the brain.",2020 Dec 25,J Biol Chem. 2020 Dec 25;295(52):18199-18212. doi: 10.1074/jbc.RA120.016049.

33245772,Dual conformational recognition by Z-DNA binding protein is important for the B-Z transition process.,"Left-handed Z-DNA is radically different from the most common right-handed B-DNA and can be stabilized by interactions with the Zα domain, which is found in a group of proteins, such as human ADAR1 and viral E3L proteins. It is well-known that most Zα domains bind to Z-DNA in a conformation-specific manner and induce rapid B-Z transition in physiological conditions. Although many structural and biochemical studies have identified the detailed interactions between the Zα domain and Z-DNA, little is known about the molecular basis of the B-Z transition process. In this study, we successfully converted the B-Z transition-defective Zα domain, vvZαE3L, into a B-Z converter by improving B-DNA binding ability, suggesting that B-DNA binding is involved in the B-Z transition. In addition, we engineered the canonical B-DNA binding protein GH5 into a Zα-like protein having both Z-DNA binding and B-Z transition activities by introducing Z-DNA interacting residues. Crystal structures of these mutants of vvZαE3L and GH5 complexed with Z-DNA confirmed the significance of conserved Z-DNA binding interactions. Altogether, our results provide molecular insight into how Zα domains obtain unusual conformational specificity and induce the B-Z transition.",2020 Dec 16,Nucleic Acids Res. 2020 Dec 16;48(22):12957-12971. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkaa1115.,"['Park C', 'Zheng X', 'Park CY', 'Kim J', 'Lee SK', 'Won H', 'Choi J', 'Kim YG', 'Choi HJ']",True
32972754,Protein-induced B-Z transition of DNA duplex containing a 2'-OMe guanosine.,"Structural transformation of the canonical right-handed helix, B-DNA, to the non-canonical left-handed helix, Z-DNA, can be induced by the Zα domain of the human RNA editing enzyme ADAR1 (hZα(ADAR1)). To characterize the site-specific preferences of binding and structural changes in DNA containing the 2'-O-methyl guanosine derivative ((m)G), titration of the imino proton spectra and chemical shift perturbations were performed on hZα(ADAR1) upon binding to Z-DNA. The structural transition between B-Z conformation as the changing ratio between DNA and protein showed a binding affinity of the modified DNA onto the Z-DNA binding protein similar to wild-type DNA or RNA. The chemical shift perturbation results showed that the overall structure and environment of the modified DNA revealed DNA-like properties rather than RNA-like characteristics. Moreover, we found evidence for two distinct regimes, ""Z-DNA Sensing"" and ""Modification Sensing"", based on the site-specific chemical shift perturbation between the DNA (or RNA) binding complex and the modified DNA-hZα(ADAR1) complex. Thus, we propose that modification of the sugar backbone of DNA with 2'-O-methyl guanosine promotes the changes in the surrounding α3 helical structural segment as well as the non-perturbed feature of the β-hairpin region.",2020 Dec 10,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2020 Dec 10;533(3):417-423. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.09.017.

32822814,A-to-I RNA editing as a tuner of noncoding RNAs in cancer.,"Recent advancement in RNA technology and computation biology shows the abundance and impact of RNA editing at the genome-wide level. Of RNA editing events, Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing is one of the most frequent types of RNA editing catalyzed by ADAR proteins. Indeed, A-to-I RNA editing occurs at the various coding and noncoding regions, triggering abnormal signaling pathways involved in cancer pathogenesis. Noncoding RNAs such as microRNA and long noncoding RNA have emerged as key regulators of pathways in cancer. The RNA editing including A-to-I editing is enriched in noncoding regions because of the abundance of noncoding RNAs accounting for 99% of total transcripts in the human genome. The effects of A-to-I editing in coding genes have been investigated and reported. However, those in noncoding RNAs have been less known in spite of the high frequency of editing events in noncoding regions. In this review, we will briefly discuss current findings and potential directions of A-to-I RNA editing research of noncoding RNAs and cancer. We will also introduce the concept of A-to-I editing, ADAR proteins, RNA editing technologies and databases.",2020 Dec 1,Cancer Lett. 2020 Dec 1;494:88-93. doi: 10.1016/j.canlet.2020.08.004.

33115807,Hypoxia Induces Transcriptional and Translational Downregulation of the Type I IFN Pathway in Multiple Cancer Cell Types.,"Hypoxia is a common phenomenon in solid tumors and is strongly linked to hallmarks of cancer. Recent evidence has shown that hypoxia promotes local immune suppression. Type I IFN supports cytotoxic T lymphocytes by stimulating the maturation of dendritic cells and enhancing their capacity to process and present antigens. However, little is known about the relationship between hypoxia and the type I IFN pathway, which comprises the sensing of double-stranded RNA and DNA (dsRNA/dsDNA) followed by IFNα/β secretion and transcriptional activation of IFN-stimulated genes (ISG). In this study, we determined the effects of hypoxia on the type I IFN pathway in breast cancer and the mechanisms involved. In cancer cell lines and xenograft models, mRNA and protein expressions of the type I IFN pathway were downregulated under hypoxic conditions. This pathway was suppressed at each level of signaling, from the dsRNA sensors RIG-I and MDA5, the adaptor MAVS, transcription factors IRF3, IRF7, and STAT1, and several ISG including RIG-I, IRF7, STAT1, and ADAR-p150. Importantly, IFN secretion was reduced under hypoxic conditions. HIF1α- and HIF2α-mediated regulation of gene expression did not explain most of the effects. However, ATAC-seq data revealed in hypoxia that peaks with STAT1 and IRF3 motifs had decreased accessibility. Collectively, these results indicate that hypoxia leads to an overall downregulation of the type I IFN pathway due to repressed transcription and lower chromatin accessibility in an HIF1/2α-independent manner, which could contribute to immunosuppression in hypoxic tumors. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings characterize a new mechanism of immunosuppression by hypoxia via downregulation of the type I IFN pathway and its autocrine/paracrine effects on tumor growth.",2020 Dec 1,Cancer Res. 2020 Dec 1;80(23):5245-5256. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-19-2306.

32651550,Identification of genetic variants controlling RNA editing and their effect on RNA structure stabilization.,"Post-transcriptional modification of RNA (RNA editing, RNAe) results in differences between the RNA transcript and the genomic DNA sequence (RDD). Enzymatic modification of adenosine to inosine (A2I) by ADAR is the most studied type of RNAe. However, few genetic association studies with A2I RNAe events have been conducted. Some studies have analyzed the inter-population RNAe-QTL diversity in humans, but the sample size of these studies was limited. Other types of RNA and DNA differences have been reported but are largely understudied. Here, we report a comprehensive analysis of all types of RDD, based on two independent datasets. We found that A2I was by far the most observed type of RDD. Moreover, manual curation suggests that A2I is likely the only enzymatically driven RNAe type observed in blood derived DNA, all other non-A2I RDD could either be attributed to sequencing and processing artifacts, or are a result of somatic DNA rearrangements. We then conducted an in-cis genetic association study and identified 472 genetic associations (RNAe-QTL), that were replicated in both datasets. We confirm the potential effect of the RNAe-QTL on RNA structure by showing that allele specific RNAe occurs in heterozygotes. Although the generally assumed function of RNAe is to destabilize double stranded RNA structure, we found clear evidence for the potential additional involvement of RNAe in maintaining RNA hairpin that has been altered by the RNAe-QTL. Our study confirms, in two independent datasets, the potential role of RNAe in maintaining RNA structure in the presence of genetic variation.",2020 Dec,Eur J Hum Genet. 2020 Dec;28(12):1753-1762. doi: 10.1038/s41431-020-0688-7.

32817447,Processing of Alu small RNAs by DICER/ADAR1 complexes and their RNAi targets.,"In addition to adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing activities, ADAR1 has been shown to have various RNA editing-independent activities including modulation of RNAi efficacy. We previously reported that ADAR1 forms a heterodimer complex with DICER and facilitates processing of pre-miRNAs to mature miRNAs. In addition to miRNA synthesis, DICER is involved in processing of long dsRNAs into small RNAs (endo-siRNAs). Generation of retrotransposon-derived endo-siRNAs by DICER and their functions in regulation of transcripts in mouse oocytes has been previously reported. However, the synthesis and functions of endo-siRNAs in somatic cells remain largely unknown. Here, we report that ADAR1 together with DICER generates endogenous small RNAs, Alu endo-siRNAs by cleaving long double-stranded regions of inverted Alu repeats. We identified AGO2-loaded Alu endo-siRNAs, which are highly expressed in commonly used cell lines. These Alu endo-siRNAs carrying both sense and antisense Alu sequences seem to target a set of genes containing a single Alu sequence, either antisense or sense, respectively, within their 3'UTR. In silico screening identified potential RNA silencing target genes for these Alu endo-siRNAs. We present results of a proof-of-concept experiment, in which sense Alu endo-siRNAs derived from AluSz and AluJr family elements target CUB Domain Containing Protein 1 mRNAs containing an antisense copy of AluJb in their 3'UTRs and consequently induce apoptosis in HeLa cells. Our results clearly indicate that Alu endo-siRNAs are functional also in somatic cells.",2020 Dec,RNA. 2020 Dec;26(12):1801-1814. doi: 10.1261/rna.076745.120.

33087935,Epigenetic therapy induces transcription of inverted SINEs and ADAR1 dependency.,"Cancer therapies that target epigenetic repressors can mediate their effects by activating retroelements within the human genome. Retroelement transcripts can form double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) that activates the MDA5 pattern recognition receptor(1-6). This state of viral mimicry leads to loss of cancer cell fitness and stimulates innate and adaptive immune responses(7,8). However, the clinical efficacy of epigenetic therapies has been limited. To find targets that would synergize with the viral mimicry response, we sought to identify the immunogenic retroelements that are activated by epigenetic therapies. Here we show that intronic and intergenic SINE elements, specifically inverted-repeat Alus, are the major source of drug-induced immunogenic dsRNA. These inverted-repeat Alus are frequently located downstream of 'orphan' CpG islands(9). In mammals, the ADAR1 enzyme targets and destabilizes inverted-repeat Alu dsRNA(10), which prevents activation of the MDA5 receptor(11). We found that ADAR1 establishes a negative-feedback loop, restricting the viral mimicry response to epigenetic therapy. Depletion of ADAR1 in patient-derived cancer cells potentiates the efficacy of epigenetic therapy, restraining tumour growth and reducing cancer initiation. Therefore, epigenetic therapies trigger viral mimicry by inducing a subset of inverted-repeats Alus, leading to an ADAR1 dependency. Our findings suggest that combining epigenetic therapies with ADAR1 inhibitors represents a promising strategy for cancer treatment.",2020 Dec,Nature. 2020 Dec;588(7836):169-173. doi: 10.1038/s41586-020-2844-1.

32396862,ADAR1-Dependent RNA Editing Promotes MET and iPSC Reprogramming by Alleviating ER Stress.,"RNA editing of adenosine to inosine (A to I) is catalyzed by ADAR1 and dramatically alters the cellular transcriptome, although its functional roles in somatic cell reprogramming are largely unexplored. Here, we show that loss of ADAR1-mediated A-to-I editing disrupts mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) during induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) reprogramming and impedes acquisition of induced pluripotency. Using chemical and genetic approaches, we show that absence of ADAR1-dependent RNA editing induces aberrant innate immune responses through the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) sensor MDA5, unleashing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and hindering epithelial fate acquisition. We found that A-to-I editing impedes MDA5 sensing and sequestration of dsRNAs encoding membrane proteins, which promote ER homeostasis by activating the PERK-dependent unfolded protein response pathway to consequently facilitate MET. This study therefore establishes a critical role for ADAR1 and its A-to-I editing activity during cell fate transitions and delineates a key regulatory layer underlying MET to control efficient reprogramming.",2020 Aug 6,Cell Stem Cell. 2020 Aug 6;27(2):300-314.e11. doi: 10.1016/j.stem.2020.04.016.

We address this need by developing a novel reagent, N-(4-ethynylphenyl)acrylamide (EPhAA), and illustrating its ability to selectively label inosine in RNA. EPhAA is synthesized in a single step, reacts rapidly with inosine, and is ""click""-compatible, enabling flexible attachment of fluorescent probes at editing sites. We first validate EPhAA reactivity and selectivity for inosine in both ribonucleosides and RNA substrates, and then apply our approach to directly monitor in vitro A-to-I RNA editing activity using recombinant ADAR enzymes. This method improves upon existing inosine chemical-labeling techniques and provides a cost-effective, rapid, and non-radioactive approach for detecting inosine formation in RNA. We envision this method will improve the study of A-to-I editing and enable better characterization of RNA modification patterns in different settings.",2020 Aug 6,Chemistry. 2020 Aug 6;26(44):9874-9878. doi: 10.1002/chem.202001667.

32867271,ADAR1 Suppresses Interferon Signaling in Gastric Cancer Cells by MicroRNA-302a-Mediated IRF9/STAT1 Regulation.,"ADAR (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA) catalyzes the deamination of adenosine to generate inosine, through its binding to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), a phenomenon known as RNA editing. One of the functions of ADAR1 is suppressing the type I interferon (IFN) response, but its mechanism in gastric cancer is not clearly understood. We analyzed changes in RNA editing and IFN signaling in ADAR1-depleted gastric cancer cells, to clarify how ADAR1 regulates IFN signaling. Interestingly, we observed a dramatic increase in the protein level of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and interferon regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) upon ADAR1 knockdown, in the absence of type I or type II IFN treatment. However, there were no changes in protein expression or localization of the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) and interferon alpha and beta-receptor subunit 2 (IFNAR2), the two known mediators of IFN production. Instead, we found that miR-302a-3p binds to the untranslated region (UTR) of IRF9 and regulate its expression. The treatment of ADAR1-depleted AGS cells with an miR-302a mimic successfully restored IRF9 as well as STAT1 protein level. Hence, our results suggest that ADAR1 regulates IFN signaling in gastric cancer through the suppression of STAT1 and IRF9 via miR-302a, which is independent from the RNA editing of known IFN production pathway.",2020 Aug 27,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 Aug 27;21(17):6195. doi: 10.3390/ijms21176195.,"['Jiang L', 'Park MJ', 'Cho CJ', 'Lee K', 'Jung MK', 'Pack CG', 'Myung SJ', 'Chang S']",False

We perform serial passages of EBOV in human and bat cells and use circular sequencing to compare the short-term evolution of the virus.

Currently, near 15,000 SARS-CoV-2 single mutations have been recorded, having a great ramification to the development of diagnostics, vaccines, antibody therapies, and drugs. However, little is known about SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary characteristics and general trend. In this work, we present a comprehensive genotyping analysis of existing SARS-CoV-2 mutations. We reveal that host immune response via APOBEC and ADAR gene editing gives rise to near 65\% of recorded mutations. Additionally, we show that children under age five and the elderly may be at high risk from COVID-19 because of their overreacting to the viral infection. Moreover, we uncover that populations of Oceania and Africa react significantly more intensively to SARS-CoV-2 infection than those of Europe and Asia, which may explain why African Americans were shown to be at increased risk of dying from COVID-19, in addition to their high risk of getting sick from COVID-19 caused by systemic health and social inequities.

32806497,Expressional Localization and Functionally Identifying an RNA Editing Enzyme BmADARa of the Silkworm Bombyx mori.,"The most common type of RNA editing in metazoans is the deamination of adenosine into inosine (A-to-I) catalyzed by the adenosine deaminase acting on the RNA (ADAR) family of proteins. The deletion or dysfunction of ADAR enzymes in higher eukaryotes can affect the efficiency of substrate editing and cause neurological disorders. However, the information concerning A-to-I RNA editing and ADAR members in the silkworm, Bombyx mori (BmADAR), is limited. In this study, a first molecular comprehensive cloning and sequence analysis of BmADAR transcripts was presented. A complete open reading frame (ORF) (BmADARa) was obtained using RT-PCR and RACE and its expression pattern, subcellular localization and A-to-I RNA-editing function on the silkworm synaptotagmin I (BmSyt I) were investigated. Subcellular localization analysis observed that BmADARa was mainly localized in the nucleus. To further study the A-to-I RNA-editing function of BmADARa, BmSyt I-pIZ-EGFP was constructed and co-transfected with BmADARa-pIZ-EGFP into BmN cells. The result demonstrates that BmADARa can functionally edit the specific site of BmSyt I.

Adenosine (A)-to-inosine (I) RNA editing, catalyzed by adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs), is a post-transcriptional modification that can potentially occur at over 100 million sites in the human genome, mainly in Alu repetitive elements that preferentially form a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) structure. A-to-I conversion within dsRNA, which may induce a structural change, is required to escape from the host immune system, given that endogenous dsRNAs transcribed from Alu repetitive elements are potentially recognized by melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) as non-self. Of note, loss-of-function mutations in the ADAR1 gene cause Aicardi-Goutières syndrome, a congenital autoimmune disease characterized by encephalopathy and a type I interferon (IFN) signature. However, the loss of ADAR1 in cancer cells with an IFN signature induces lethality via the activation of protein kinase R in addition to MDA5. This makes cells more sensitive to immunotherapy, highlighting the opposing immune status of autoimmune diseases (overreaction) and cancer (tolerance).

32275931,ADAR1 Transcriptome editing promotes breast cancer progression through the regulation of cell cycle and DNA damage response.,"RNA editing has emerged as a novel mechanism in cancer progression. The double stranded RNA-specific adenosine deaminase (ADAR) modifies the expression of an important proportion of genes involved in cell cycle control, DNA damage response (DDR) and transcriptional processing, suggesting an important role of ADAR in transcriptome regulation. Despite the phenotypic implications of ADAR deregulation in several cancer models, the role of ADAR on DDR and proliferation in breast cancer has not been fully addressed. Here, we show that ADAR expression correlates significantly with clinical outcomes and DDR, cell cycle and proliferation mRNAs of previously reported edited transcripts in breast cancer patients. ADAR's knock-down in a breast cancer cell line produces stability changes of mRNAs involved in DDR and DNA replication. Breast cancer cells with reduced levels of ADAR show a decreased viability and an increase in apoptosis, displaying a significant decrease of their DDR activation, compared to control cells. These results suggest that ADAR plays an important role in breast cancer progression through the regulation of mRNA stability and expression of those genes involved in proliferation and DDR impacting the viability of breast cancer cells.",2020 Aug,Biochim Biophys Acta Mol Cell Res. 2020 Aug;1867(8):118716. doi: 10.1016/j.bbamcr.2020.118716.

We find that ADAR has a 100× higher impact on splicing than ADARB1, although both enzymes target a similar number of substrates with a large common overlap. Consistently, differentially spliced regions frequently harbor ADAR editing sites. Moreover, catalytically dead ADAR also impacts splicing, demonstrating that RNA binding of ADAR affects splicing. In contrast, ADARB1 editing sites are found enriched 5' of differentially spliced regions. Several of these ADARB1-mediated editing events change splice consensus sequences, therefore strongly influencing splicing of some mRNAs. A significant overlap between differentially edited and differentially spliced sites suggests evolutionary selection toward splicing being regulated by editing in a tissue-specific manner.",2020 Aug,Genome Res. 2020 Aug;30(8):1107-1118. doi: 10.1101/gr.256933.119.

31956894,An internal deletion of ADAR rescued by MAVS deficiency leads to a minute phenotype.,"The RNA-editing protein ADAR is essential for early development in the mouse. Genetic evidence suggests that A to I editing marks endogenous RNAs as 'self'. Today, different Adar knockout alleles have been generated that show a common phenotype of apoptosis, liver disintegration, elevated immune response and lethality at E12.5. All the Adar knockout alleles can be rescued by a concomitant deletion of the innate immunity genes Mavs or Ifih1 (MDA5), albeit to different extents. This suggests multiple functions of ADAR. We analyze AdarΔ7-9 mice that show a unique growth defect phenotype when rescued by Mavs. We show that AdarΔ7-9 can form a truncated, unstable, editing deficient protein that is mislocalized. Histological and hematologic analysis of these mice indicate multiple tissue- and hematopoietic defects. Gene expression profiling shows dysregulation of Rps3a1 and Rps3a3 in rescued AdarΔ7-9. Consistently, a distortion in 40S and 60S ribosome ratios is observed in liver cells. This dysregulation is also seen in AdarΔ2-13; Mavs-/- but not in AdarE861A/E861A; Ifih1-/- mice, suggesting editing-independent functions of ADAR in regulating expression levels of Rps3a1 and Rps3a3. In conclusion, our study demonstrates the importance of ADAR in post-natal development which cannot be compensated by ADARB1.",2020 Apr 6,Nucleic Acids Res. 2020 Apr 6;48(6):3286-3303. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkaa025.,"['Bajad P', 'Ebner F', 'Amman F', 'Szabó B', 'Kapoor U', 'Manjali G', 'Hildebrandt A', 'Janisiw MP', 'Jantsch MF']",True
32052578,Androgen receptor-regulated circFNTA activates KRAS signaling to promote bladder cancer invasion.,"The androgen receptor (AR) has been linked to bladder cancer (BCa) progression, but if this involves circular RNAs (circRNAs) remains unclear. Here, we find that AR alters the levels of circRNA-FNTA (circFNTA) to increase BCa cell invasion and chemo-resistance. Mechanistically, AR represses the RNA editing gene ADAR2 via direct binding to its 5' promoter region to increase circFNTA levels, which then sponges the microRNA miR-370-3p to increase the expression of its host gene FNTA. This AR-mediated ADAR2/circFNTA/miR-370-3p/FNTA pathway then activates KRAS signaling to alter BCa cell invasion and chemo-sensitivity to cisplatin. A clinical BCa sample survey shows that circFNTA expression is elevated in BCa tissues, and results from a BCa mouse model indicate that depletion of circFNTA leads to the suppression of BCa metastases and increased cisplatin chemo-sensitivity. Together, based on our results using multiple BCa cell lines and an in vivo mouse model we suggest that targeting this newly identified AR/ADAR2/circFNTA/miR-370-3p/FNTA/KRAS axis may lead to the development of therapies to suppress BCa metastasis and to increase its chemo-sensitivity.",2020 Apr 3,EMBO Rep. 2020 Apr 3;21(4):e48467. doi: 10.15252/embr.201948467.

32348766,ADAR1 Facilitates KSHV Lytic Reactivation by Modulating the RLR-Dependent Signaling Pathway.,"Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is a double-stranded DNA virus that exhibits two alternative life cycles: latency and lytic reactivation. During lytic reactivation, host innate immune responses are activated to restrict viral replication. Here, we report that adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) is required for optimal KSHV lytic reactivation from latency. Knockdown of ADAR1 in KSHV latently infected cells inhibits viral gene transcription and viral replication during KSHV lytic reactivation. ADAR1 deficiency also significantly increases type I interferon production during KSHV reactivation. This increased interferon response is dependent on activation of the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) pathway. Depletion of ADAR1 together with either RIG-I, MDA5, or MAVS reverses the increased IFNβ production and rescues KSHV lytic replication. These data suggest that ADAR1 serves as a proviral factor for KSHV lytic reactivation and facilitates DNA virus reactivation by dampening the RLR pathway-mediated innate immune response.",2020 Apr 28,Cell Rep. 2020 Apr 28;31(4):107564. doi: 10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107564.,"['Zhang H', 'Ni G', 'Damania B']",True

Here we adapt the HyperTRIBE method using an RBP fused to a Drosophila RNA editing enzyme (ADAR) to globally map the mRNA targets of the RBP MSI2 in mammalian adult normal and malignant stem cells. We reveal a unique MUSASHI-2 (MSI2) mRNA binding network in hematopoietic stem cells that changes during transition to multipotent progenitors. Additionally, we discover a significant increase in RNA binding activity of MSI2 in leukemic stem cells compared with normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, resulting in selective regulation of MSI2's oncogenic targets. This provides a basis for MSI2 increased dependency in leukemia cells compared to normal cells. Moreover, our study provides a way to measure RBP function in rare cells and suggests that RBPs can achieve differential binding activity during cell state transition independent of gene expression.",2020 Apr 24,Nat Commun. 2020 Apr 24;11(1):2026. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-15814-8.,"['Nguyen DTT', 'Lu Y', 'Chu KL', 'Yang X', 'Park SM', 'Choo ZN', 'Chin CR', 'Prieto C', 'Schurer A', 'Barin E', 'Savino AM', 'Gourkanti S', 'Patel P', 'Vu LP', 'Leslie CS', 'Kharas MG']",True

Impaired ADAR2 editing leads to early-onset epilepsy and premature death in a mouse model. Here, we report bi-allelic variants in ADARB1, the gene encoding ADAR2, in four unrelated individuals with microcephaly, intellectual disability, and epilepsy. In one individual, a homozygous variant in one of the double-stranded RNA-binding domains (dsRBDs) was identified. In the others, variants were situated in or around the deaminase domain. To evaluate the effects of these variants on ADAR2 enzymatic activity, we performed in vitro assays with recombinant proteins in HEK293T cells and ex vivo assays with fibroblasts derived from one of the individuals. We demonstrate that these ADAR2 variants lead to reduced editing activity on a known ADAR2 substrate. We also demonstrate that one variant leads to changes in splicing of ADARB1 transcript isoforms.

We have previously reported that ADAR1 is required for establishing central tolerance during the late stage of thymocyte development by preventing MDA5 sensing of endogenous dsRNA as nonself. However, the role of ADAR1 during the early developmental stage remains unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that early thymocyte-specific deletion of ADAR1 in mice caused severe thymic atrophy with excessive apoptosis and impaired transition to a late stage of development accompanied by the loss of TCR expression. Concurrent MDA5 deletion ameliorated apoptosis but did not restore impaired transition and TCR expression. In addition, forced TCR expression was insufficient to restore the transition. However, simultaneous TCR expression and MDA5 deletion efficiently ameliorated the impaired transition of ADAR1-deficient thymocytes to the late stage. These findings indicate that RNA-editing-dependent and -independent functions of ADAR1 synergistically regulate early thymocyte development.",2020 Apr 15,J Immunol. 2020 Apr 15;204(8):2156-2168. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1900929.

31800094,High RIG-I expression in ovarian cancer associates with an immune-escape signature and poor clinical outcome.,"Ovarian cancer (OC) is the most lethal gynecological malignancy, with platinum-based chemotherapy remaining the mainstay for adjuvant treatment after surgery. The lack of indication for immunotherapy may at least in part result from the lack of suitable biomarkers allowing stratification of potentially responding patients. In this monocentric study of 141 cases with OC, we used real-time quantitative PCR to assess the expression of retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I) in primary tumor and healthy ovarian control tissues. RIG-I expression was correlated to various clinicopathological characteristics as well as to a set of molecular and immunological markers. The prognostic significance of RIG-I expression was queried in univariate and multivariate analyses and validated in an independent cohort. RIG-I was overexpressed in the cancerous ovary and correlated with a higher tumor grade. The more aggressive Type-II cancers and cancers with inactivating p53 mutations exhibited higher RIG-I expression. RIG-I levels were also elevated in cancers that recurred after remission or were platinum-refractory. Survival analyses disclosed RIG-I as an independent marker of poor outcome in OC. Continuative analyses revealed the molecular and immunological correlates of RIG-I expression in the tumor microenvironment, including interferon production and a distinct immune-regulatory signature involving checkpoint molecules (PD-L1/PD-1), the RNA-editing enzyme ADAR1 and the regulatory T cell-specific transcription factor FoxP3. We conclude that high RIG-I expression associates with poor outcome in OC, which is explainable by local immunosuppression in the tumor bed. RIG-I expression may inform checkpoint blockade and/or RIG-I agonistic targeting in a subset of high-risk OC patients.",2020 Apr 1,Int J Cancer. 2020 Apr 1;146(7):2007-2018. doi: 10.1002/ijc.32818.

31941663,A comparative analysis of ADAR mutant mice reveals site-specific regulation of RNA editing.,"Adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing is an essential post-transcriptional modification catalyzed by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR)1 and ADAR2 in mammals. For numerous sites in coding sequences (CDS) and microRNAs, editing is highly conserved and has significant biological consequences, for example, by altering amino acid residues and target recognition. However, no comprehensive and quantitative studies have been undertaken to determine how specific ADARs contribute to conserved sites in vivo. Here, we amplified each RNA region with editing site(s) separately and combined these for deep sequencing. Then, we compared the editing ratios of all sites that were conserved in CDS and microRNAs in the cerebral cortex and spleen of wild-type mice, Adar1(E861A/E861A)Ifih(-/-) mice expressing inactive ADAR1 (Adar1 KI) and Adar2(-/-)Gria2(R/R) (Adar2 KO) mice. We found that most of the sites showed a preference for one ADAR. In contrast, some sites, such as miR-3099-3p, showed no ADAR preference. In addition, we found that the editing ratio for several sites, such as DACT3 R/G, was up-regulated in either Adar mutant mouse strain, whereas a coordinated interplay between ADAR1 and ADAR2 was required for the efficient editing of specific sites, such as the 5-HT(2C)R B site. We further created double mutant Adar1 KI Adar2 KO mice and observed viable and fertile animals with the complete absence of editing, demonstrating that ADAR1 and ADAR2 are the sole enzymes responsible for all editing sites in vivo. Collectively, these findings indicate that editing is regulated in a site-specific manner by the different interplay between ADAR1 and ADAR2.",2020 Apr,RNA. 2020 Apr;26(4):454-469. doi: 10.1261/rna.072728.119.

32157211,ADAR1-mediated RNA editing is a novel oncogenic process in thyroid cancer and regulates miR-200 activity.,"Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) convert adenosine to inosine in double-stranded RNA. A-to-I editing of RNA is a widespread posttranscriptional process that has recently emerged as an important mechanism in cancer biology. A-to-I editing levels are high in several human cancers, including thyroid cancer, but ADAR1 editase-dependent mechanisms governing thyroid cancer progression are unexplored. To address the importance of RNA A-to-I editing in thyroid cancer, we examined the role of ADAR1. Loss-of-function analysis showed that ADAR1 suppression profoundly repressed proliferation, invasion, and migration in thyroid tumor cell models. These observations were validated in an in vivo xenograft model, which showed that ADAR1-silenced cells had a diminished ability to form tumors. RNA editing of miRNAs has the potential to markedly alter target recognition. According to TCGA data, the tumor suppressor miR-200b is overedited in thyroid tumors, and its levels of editing correlate with a worse progression-free survival and disease stage. We confirmed miR-200b overediting in thyroid tumors and we showed that edited miR-200b has weakened activity against its target gene ZEB1 in thyroid cancer cells, likely explaining the reduced aggressiveness of ADAR1-silenced cells. We also found that RAS, but not BRAF, modulates ADAR1 levels, an effect mediated predominantly by PI3K and in part by MAPK. Lastly, pharmacological inhibition of ADAR1 activity with the editing inhibitor 8-azaadenosine reduced cancer cell aggressiveness. Overall, our data implicate ADAR1-mediated A-to-I editing as an important pathway in thyroid cancer progression, and highlight RNA editing as a potential therapeutic target in thyroid cancer.",2020 Apr,Oncogene. 2020 Apr;39(18):3738-3753. doi: 10.1038/s41388-020-1248-x.

32339124,Systematic identification of A-to-I editing associated regulators from multiple human cancers.,"A-to-I editing is the most common editing type in humans that is catalyzed by ADAR family members (ADARs), ADAR1 and ADAR2. Although millions of A-to-I editing sites have recently been discovered, the regulation mechanisms of the RNA editing process are still not clear. Herein, we developed a two-step logistic regression model to identify genes that are potentially involved in the RNA editing process in four human cancers. In the first step, we tested the association of each editing site with known enzymes. To validate the logistic regression model, we collected 10 genes with 168 editing sites from multiple published studies and obtained a nearly 100% validation rate. ADAR1 was identified as the enzyme associated with the majority of the A-to-I editing sites. Thus, ADAR1 was taken as a control gene in the second step to identify genes that have a stronger regulation effect on editing sites than ADAR1. Using our advanced method, we successfully found a set of genes that were significantly positively or negatively associated (PA or NA) with specific sets of RNA editing sites. 51 of these genes had been reported in at least one previous study. We highlighted two genes: 1), SRSF5, supported by three previous studies, and 2) MIR22HG, supported by one previous study and two of our cancer datasets. The PA and NA genes were cancer-specific but shared common pathways. Interestingly, the PA genes from kidney cancer were enriched for survival-associated genes while the NA genes were not, indicating that the PA genes may play more important roles in kidney cancer progression.",2020 Apr,Comput Biol Med. 2020 Apr;119:103690. doi: 10.1016/j.compbiomed.2020.103690.

Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) is reportedly overexpressed in many types of tumors, such as lung, liver, breast, and esophageal cancers. However, the biological significance and specific mechanism of ADAR1 in pancreatic cancer have not been explored. In this study, we reveal that the expression level of ADAR1 is significantly up-regulated in pancreatic cancer tissues. We also find that highly expressed ADAR1 is closely associated with poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer specimens. Overexpressed ADAR1 equally increased the growth activity of pancreatic cancer cells in vivo and in vitro. We further demonstrate that ADAR1 stabilizes c-Myc through AKT signaling, which contributes to cancer cell resistance to BET inhibitors in pancreatic cancer cells. Moreover, we reveal that EZH2 regulates ADAR1 expression, and EZH2 and BET inhibitors show synergistic inhibition in pancreatic cancer.

Methods and Results: To investigate whether maintenance of ADAR1 expression is required for normal myocardial homeostasis, we bypassed the early embryonic lethality of ADAR1-null mice through the use of a tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase under the control of the cardiac-specific α-myosin heavy chain promoter (αMHC). Targeted ADAR1 deletion in adult mice caused a significant increase in lethality accompanied by severe ventricular remodeling and quick and spontaneous cardiac dysfunction, induction of stress markers and overall reduced expression of miRNAs. Administration of a selective inhibitor of the unfolded protein response (UPR) stress significantly blunted the deleterious effects and improved cardiac function thereby prolonging animal survival. In vitro restoring miR-199a-5p levels in cardiomyocytes lacking ADAR1 diminished UPR activation and concomitant apoptosis.

ADAR1 is highly expressed in ""septic"" macrophages and in small intestinal tissues of mice with sepsis. Overexpression of ADAR1 suppresses inflammation and intestinal damage. However, the specific underlying mechanism is unclear. This study was conducted to explore how microRNA (miRNA) regulates the anti-inflammatory mechanism of macrophages following ADAR1 upregulation. A murine sepsis model was established by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Mice were randomly assigned to sham, CLP, and CLP+ADAR1 groups. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining and fluorescence isothiocyanate-dextran were used to evaluate intestinal injury and permeability. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), western blotting, and Luminex assays were performed to detect changes in the expression of inflammatory cytokines. Adenoviruses were used to express ADAR1 in RAW 264.7 cells. Ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation analysis was conducted to detect the binding of ADAR1 and miRNAs. A dual-luciferase reporter assay was used to detect the binding of miRNAs and regulatory factors. We observed that ADAR1 significantly increased the expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) in macrophages and reduced the expression of interleukin-6 in macrophages and the serum, thereby reducing intestinal permeability and mucosal injury in mice with sepsis. The RNA-ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation binding assay and qRT-PCR demonstrated a direct interaction between ADAR1 and pri-miR-30a.

32905549,ADAR1 regulates melanoma cell invasiveness by controlling beta3-integrin via microRNA-30 family members.,"Melanoma cells utilize multiple mechanisms to exit the primary tumor mass, invade the surroundings and subsequently distant tissues. We have previously reported that the expression of the RNA editing enzyme ADAR1 (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA) is downregulated in metastatic melanoma, which facilitates proliferation and invasion. Here we show that ADAR1 controls melanoma invasiveness by regulating ITGB3 expression via miR-30a and miR-30d. ADAR1 overexpression or knockdown leads to an increase or decrease, respectively, in the expression of both microRNAs. The effect is independent of RNA-editing. Dual luciferase assays show that both microRNAs directly regulate the expression of the ITGB3 integrin. Overexpression of the miR-30a or miR-30d lead to a decrease in ITGB3 and a resultant decreased invasive and metastatic capacities. Neutralization of the endogenous miR-30a or miR-30d leads to the opposite effect. The microRNAs regulate ITGB3 levels probably through a post-transcriptional effect, as both mRNA and protein levels of ITGB3 are affected.

G-to-A mutations are common in mammals and can be treated by adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing, a type of substitutional RNA editing. The molecular mechanism of A-to-I editing involves the hydrolytic deamination of adenosine to an inosine base; this reaction is mediated by RNA-specific deaminases, adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs), family protein. Here, we review recent findings regarding the application of ADARs to restoring the genetic code along with different approaches involved in the process of artificial RNA editing by ADAR. We have also addressed comparative studies of various isoforms of ADARs. Therefore, we will try to provide a detailed overview of the artificial RNA editing and the role of ADAR with a focus on the enzymatic site directed A-to-I editing.",2020,Curr Gene Ther. 2020;20(1):44-54. doi: 10.2174/1566523220666200516170137.,"['Bhakta S', 'Tsukahara T']",True
32944232,Developmental stage-specific A-to-I editing pattern in the postnatal pineal gland of pigs (Sus scrofa).,"BACKGROUND: RNA editing is a widespread post-transcriptional modification mechanism in mammalian genomes. Although many editing sites have been identified in domestic pigs (Sus scrofa), little is known about the characteristics and dynamic regulation of RNA editing in the pineal gland (PG), a small neuroendocrine gland that synthesizes and secretes melatonin, which is primarily responsible to modulate sleep patterns. RESULTS: This study analyzed the expression of adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing regulators and profiled the first dynamic A-to-I RNA editome during postnatal PG development. The results identified ADAR1 as the most abundantly expressed ADAR enzyme, which was down-regulated during postnatal PG development. Furthermore, 47,284 high-confidence RNA editing sites were identified, the majority of which (93.6%) were of the canonical A-to-I editing type, followed by C-to-T editing. Analysis of its characteristics showed that the A-to-I editing sites mostly localized in SINE retrotransposons PRE-1/Pre0_SS. Moreover, a strong deficiency and preference for guanine nucleotides at positions of one base upstream or downstream were found, respectively. The overall editing level at the puberty stage was higher than at both infancy and adulthood stages. Additionally, genome-wide RNA editing was found to exhibit a dynamic stage-specific fashion (postnatally). Genes that underwent developmental changes in RNA editing were associated with catabolic processes as well as protein localization and transport functions, implying that RNA editing might be responsible for the molecular machineries of the postnatal developing PG. Remarkably, RNA editing in 3'-UTRs might regulate gene expression by influencing miRNA binding during PG development. CONCLUSIONS: This study profiles the first comprehensive developmental RNA editome in the pig PG, which contributes to the understanding of the importance of post-transcriptionally mediated regulation during mammalian postnatal PG development. Moreover, this study widely extends RNA editome resources in mammals.",2020,J Anim Sci Biotechnol. 2020 Sep 7;11:90. doi: 10.1186/s40104-020-00495-6. eCollection 2020.,"['Zhou R', 'Yao W', 'Xie C', 'Zhang L', 'Pei Y', 'Li H', 'Feng Z', 'Yang Y', 'Li K']",True
33062411,Global RNA editome landscape discovers reduced RNA editing in glioma: loss of editing of gamma-amino butyric acid receptor alpha subunit 3 (GABRA3) favors glioma migration and invasion.,"BACKGROUND: Gliomas are the most common and lethal type of intracranial tumors. With the current treatment regime, the median survival of patients with grade IV glioma (glioblastoma/GBM) remains at 14-16 months. RNA editing modifies the function and regulation of transcripts. The development of glial tumors may be caused by altered RNA editing events. METHODS: In this study, we uncover the global RNA editome landscape of glioma patients from RNA-seq data of control, lower grade glioma (LGG) and GBM samples (n = 1,083). RESULTS: A-to-I editing events were found to comprise 80% of the total editing events of which 96% were located in the Alu regions. The total RNA editing events were found to be reduced in glioma compared to control samples. More specifically, we found Gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor alpha3 (GABRA3) to be edited (c.1026 A-to-G; pI343M) in 73% (editing ratio 0.8) of control samples compared to LGG (28.96%; 0.47) and GBM (5.2%; 0.53) samples. GABRA3 transcript level was found to be downregulated in glioma compared to control in a grade-specific manner with GBMs having the lowest level of the transcript. Further, GABRA3 transcripts were observed to be higher in edited compared to unedited glioma samples. The transcript and protein levels of exogenously expressed gene were found to be higher for edited compared to unedited GABRA3 in glioma cells. Further, exogenously expressed edited GABRA3 inhibited migration and invasion of glioma cells efficiently but not the unedited GABRA3. CONCLUSION: Collectively, our study discovered a reduction in RNA editing during glioma development. We further demonstrate that elevated RNA editing maintains a high level of GABRA3 RNA and protein in normal glial cells which provides a less migratory environment for the normal functioning of the brain. In contrast, the reduction in GABRA3 protein levels, due to lower stability of unedited RNA, results in the loss of function which confers an aggressive phenotype to GBM tumor.",2020,PeerJ. 2020 Sep 29;8:e9755. doi: 10.7717/peerj.9755. eCollection 2020.,"['Patil V', 'Pal J', 'Mahalingam K', 'Somasundaram K']",False

33101175,SAMHD1 as the Potential Link Between SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Neurological Complications.,"The recent pandemic of coronavirus infectious illness 2019 (COVID19) triggered by SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly spread around the globe, generating in severe events an acute, highly lethal pneumonia and death. In the past two hitherto similar CoVs, the severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV-1) and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) also gained universal attention as they produced clinical symptoms similar to those of SARS-CoV-2 utilizing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) to go into the cells. COVID-19 may also present with overtly neurological symptoms. The proper understanding of the expression and dissemination of ACE2 in central and peripheral nerve systems is crucial to understand better the neurological morbidity caused by COVID-19. Using the STRING bioinformatic tool and references through text mining tools associated to Coronaviruses, we identified SAMHD1 as the probable link to neurological symptoms. Paralleled to the response to influenza A virus and, specifically, respiratory syncytial virus, SARS-CoV-2 evokes a response that needs robust induction of a subclass of cytokines, including the Type I and, obviously, Type III interferons as well as a few chemokines. We correlate ACE2 to the pathogenesis and neurologic complications of COVID-19 and found that SAMHD1 links to NF-κB pathway. No correlation was found with other molecules associated with Coronavirus infection, including ADAR, BST2, IRF3, IFITM3, ISG15, MX1, MX2, RNASEL, RSAD2, and VPRBP. We suggest that SAMHD1 is the molecule that may be behind the mechanisms of the neurological complications associated with COVID-19.",2020,Front Neurol. 2020 Sep 25;11:562913. doi: 10.3389/fneur.2020.562913. eCollection 2020.,"['Khan A', 'Sergi C']",True
33330108,MicroRNAs in Skeletal Muscle and Hints on Their Potential Role in Muscle Wasting During Cancer Cachexia.,"Cancer-associated cachexia is a heterogeneous, multifactorial syndrome characterized by systemic inflammation, unintentional weight loss, and profound alteration in body composition. The main feature of cancer cachexia is represented by the loss of skeletal muscle tissue, which may or may not be accompanied by significant adipose tissue wasting. Such phenotypic alteration occurs as the result of concomitant increased myofibril breakdown and reduced muscle protein synthesis, actively contributing to fatigue, worsening of quality of life, and refractoriness to chemotherapy. According to the classical view, this condition is primarily triggered by interactions between specific tumor-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines and their cognate receptors expressed on the myocyte membrane. This causes a shift in gene expression of muscle cells, eventually leading to a pronounced catabolic condition and cell death. More recent studies, however, have shown the involvement of regulatory non-coding RNAs in the outbreak of cancer cachexia. In particular, the role exerted by microRNAs is being widely addressed, and several mechanistic studies are in progress. In this review, we discuss the most recent findings concerning the role of microRNAs in triggering or exacerbating muscle wasting in cancer cachexia, while mentioning about possible roles played by long non-coding RNAs and ADAR-mediated miRNA modifications.",2020,Front Oncol. 2020 Nov 24;10:607196. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.607196. eCollection 2020.,"['Marceca GP', 'Nigita G', 'Calore F', 'Croce CM']",False
33415135,Genome-Wide Characterization of RNA Editing Sites in Primary Gastric Adenocarcinoma through RNA-seq Data Analysis.,"RNA editing is a posttranscriptional nucleotide modification in humans. Of the various types of RNA editing, the adenosine to inosine substitution is the most widespread in higher eukaryotes, which is mediated by the ADAR family enzymes. Inosine is recognized by the biological machinery as guanosine; therefore, editing could have substantial functional effects throughout the genome. RNA editing could contribute to cancer either by exclusive editing of tumor suppressor/promoting genes or by introducing transcriptomic diversity to promote cancer progression. Here, we provided a comprehensive overview of the RNA editing sites in gastric adenocarcinoma and highlighted some of their possible contributions to gastric cancer. RNA-seq data corresponding to 8 gastric adenocarcinoma and their paired nontumor counterparts were retrieved from the GEO database. After preprocessing and variant calling steps, a stringent filtering pipeline was employed to distinguish potential RNA editing sites from SNPs. The identified potential editing sites were annotated and compared with those in the DARNED database. Totally, 12362 high-confidence adenosine to inosine RNA editing sites were detected across all samples. Of these, 12105 and 257 were known and novel editing events, respectively. These editing sites were unevenly distributed across genomic regions, and nearly half of them were located in 3'UTR. Our results revealed that 4868 editing sites were common in both normal and cancer tissues. From the remaining sites, 3985 and 3509 were exclusive to normal and cancer tissues, respectively. Further analysis revealed a significant number of differentially edited events among these sites, which were located in protein coding genes and microRNAs. Given the distinct pattern of RNA editing in gastric adenocarcinoma and adjacent normal tissue, edited sites have the potential to serve as the diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets in gastric cancer.",2020,Int J Genomics. 2020 Dec 18;2020:6493963. doi: 10.1155/2020/6493963. eCollection 2020.,"['Behroozi J', 'Shahbazi S', 'Bakhtiarizadeh MR', 'Mahmoodzadeh H']",False
33643923,A-to-I RNA Editing in Cancer: From Evaluating the Editing Level to Exploring the Editing Effects.,"As an important regulatory mechanism at the posttranscriptional level in metazoans, adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR)-induced A-to-I RNA editing modification of double-stranded RNA has been widely detected and reported. Editing may lead to non-synonymous amino acid mutations, RNA secondary structure alterations, pre-mRNA processing changes, and microRNA-mRNA redirection, thereby affecting multiple cellular processes and functions. In recent years, researchers have successfully developed several bioinformatics software tools and pipelines to identify RNA editing sites. However, there are still no widely accepted editing site standards due to the variety of parallel optimization and RNA high-seq protocols and programs. It is also challenging to identify RNA editing by normal protocols in tumor samples due to the high DNA mutation rate. Numerous RNA editing sites have been reported to be located in non-coding regions and can affect the biosynthesis of ncRNAs, including miRNAs and circular RNAs. Predicting the function of RNA editing sites located in non-coding regions and ncRNAs is significantly difficult.

31547885,RNA editing in the forefront of epitranscriptomics and human health.,"Post-transcriptional modifications have been recently expanded with the addition of RNA editing, which is predominantly mediated by adenosine and cytidine deaminases acting on DNA and RNA. Here, we review the full spectrum of physiological processes in which these modifiers are implicated, among different organisms. Adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) editors, members of the ADAR and ADAT protein families are important regulators of alternative splicing and transcriptional control. On the other hand, cytidine to uridine (C-to-U) editors, members of the AID/APOBEC family, are heavily implicated in innate and adaptive immunity with important roles in antibody diversification and antiviral response. Physiologically, these enzymes are present in the nucleus and/or the cytoplasm, where they modify various RNA molecules, including miRNAs, tRNAs apart from mRNAs, whereas DNA editing is also possible by some of them. The expansion of next generation sequencing technologies provided a wealth of data regarding such modifications. RNA editing has been implicated in various disorders including cancer, and neurological diseases of the brain or the central nervous system. It is also related to cancer heterogeneity and the onset of carcinogenesis. Response to treatment can also be affected by the RNA editing status where drug efficacy is significantly compromised.

31366735,Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA-1 (ADAR1) inhibits hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication by enhancing microRNA-122 processing.,"Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA-1 (ADAR1) involves adenosine to inosine RNA editing and microRNA processing. ADAR1 is known to be involved in the replication of various viruses, including hepatitis C and D. However, the role of ADAR1 in hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection has not yet been elucidated. Here, for the first time, we demonstrated ADAR1 antiviral activity against HBV. ADAR1 has two splicing isoforms in human hepatocytes: constitutive p110 protein and interferon-α (IFN-α)-responsive p150 protein. We found that overexpression of ADAR1 decreased HBV RNA in an HBV culture model. A catalytic-site mutant ADAR1 also decreased HBV RNA levels, whereas another adenosine deaminases that act on the RNA (ADAR) family protein, ADAR2, did not. Moreover, the induction of ADAR1 by stimulation with IFN-α also reduced HBV RNA levels. Decreases in endogenous ADAR1 expression by knock-down or knock-out increased HBV RNA levels. A major hepatocyte-specific microRNA, miRNA-122, was found to be positively correlated with ADAR1 expression, and exogenous miRNA-122 decreased both HBV RNA and DNA, whereas, conversely, transfection with a miRNA-122 inhibitor increased them. The reduction of HBV RNA by ADAR1 expression was abrogated by p53 knock-down, suggesting the involvement of p53 in the ADAR1-mediated reduction of HBV RNA. This study demonstrated, for the first time, that ADAR1 plays an antiviral role against HBV infection by increasing the level of miRNA-122 in hepatocytes.",2019 Sep 20,J Biol Chem. 2019 Sep 20;294(38):14043-14054. doi: 10.1074/jbc.RA119.007970.

31071221,Non-self mutation: double-stranded RNA elicits antiviral pathogenic response in a Drosophila model of expanded CAG repeat neurodegenerative diseases.,"Inflammation is activated prior to symptoms in neurodegenerative diseases, providing a plausible pathogenic mechanism. Indeed, genetic and pharmacological ablation studies in animal models of several neurodegenerative diseases demonstrate that inflammation is required for pathology. However, while there is growing evidence that inflammation-mediated pathology may be the common mechanism underlying neurodegenerative diseases, including those due to dominantly inherited expanded repeats, the proximal causal agent is unknown. Expanded CAG.CUG repeat double-stranded RNA causes inflammation-mediated pathology when expressed in Drosophila. Repeat dsRNA is recognized by Dicer-2 as a foreign or 'non-self' molecule triggering both antiviral RNA and RNAi pathways. Neither of the RNAi pathway cofactors R2D2 nor loquacious are necessary, indicating antiviral RNA activation. RNA modification enables avoidance of recognition as 'non-self' by the innate inflammatory surveillance system. Human ADAR1 edits RNA conferring 'self' status and when co-expressed with expanded CAG.CUG dsRNA in Drosophila the pathology is lost. Cricket Paralysis Virus protein CrPV-1A is a known antagonist of Argonaute-2 in Drosophila antiviral defense. CrPV-1A co-expression also rescues pathogenesis, confirming anti-viral-RNA response. Repeat expansion mutation therefore confers 'non-self' recognition of endogenous RNA, thereby providing a proximal, autoinflammatory trigger for expanded repeat neurodegenerative diseases.",2019 Sep 15,Hum Mol Genet. 2019 Sep 15;28(18):3000-3012. doi: 10.1093/hmg/ddz096.,"['van Eyk CL', 'Samaraweera SE', 'Scott A', 'Webber DL', 'Harvey DP', 'Mecinger O', ""O'Keefe LV"", 'Cropley JE', 'Young P', 'Ho J', 'Suter C', 'Richards RI']",False
31270214,Adenosine Deaminases Acting on RNA Downregulate the Expression of Constitutive Androstane Receptor in the Human Liver-Derived Cells by Attenuating Splicing.,"Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) enzymes-catalyzing adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing possibly modulates gene expression and function. In this study, we investigated whether ADARs regulate the expression of human constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), which controls the expression of various drug-metabolizing enzymes. CAR mRNA and protein levels in human hepatocellular carcinoma-derived HepG2 cells were increased by knockdown of ADAR1 and slightly increased by ADAR2, indicating that ADARs negatively regulate CAR expression. Increased luciferase activity of a reporter plasmid containing the CYP3A4 promoter region by phenobarbital was augmented by transfection of siRNA for ADAR1 (siADAR1) but not by siADAR2. In addition, the knockdown of ADAR1 resulted in the enhanced induction of CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 mRNA by 6-(4-chlorophenyl)imidazo[2,1-b][1,3]thiazole-5-carbaldehyde O-(3,4-dichlorobenzyl)oxime and phenobarbital, respectively. These results suggest that ADAR1-mediated downregulation of CAR affects its downstream cytochrome P450 expression. When the transcription was inhibited by α-amanitin, the degradation of CAR mRNA was attenuated by knockdown of ADAR1, suggesting that the increase in CAR mRNA level by ADAR1 knockdown is a post-transcriptional event. Finally, we found that ADAR1 knockdown promotes the splicing of CAR as a mechanism of the increased expression of CAR by ADAR1 knockdown. In conclusion, this study revealed that ADAR1 plays a role in modulating xenobiotic metabolism potency via regulation of CAR. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This study revealed that adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) and ADAR2, which catalyze adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing, downregulate the expression of constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) in human liver-derived cells by attenuating splicing. The downregulation of CAR by ADARs affected its downstream cytochrome P450 expression.

31308540,Programmable RNA editing by recruiting endogenous ADAR using engineered RNAs.,"Current tools for targeted RNA editing rely on the delivery of exogenous proteins or chemically modified guide RNAs, which may lead to aberrant effector activity, delivery barrier or immunogenicity. Here, we present an approach, called leveraging endogenous ADAR for programmable editing of RNA (LEAPER), that employs short engineered ADAR-recruiting RNAs (arRNAs) to recruit native ADAR1 or ADAR2 enzymes to change a specific adenosine to inosine. We show that arRNA, delivered by a plasmid or viral vector or as a synthetic oligonucleotide, achieves editing efficiencies of up to 80%. LEAPER is highly specific, with rare global off-targets and limited editing of non-target adenosines in the target region. It is active in a broad spectrum of cell types, including multiple human primary cell types, and can restore α-L-iduronidase catalytic activity in Hurler syndrome patient-derived primary fibroblasts without evoking innate immune responses.

31427386,A high resolution A-to-I editing map in the mouse identifies editing events controlled by pre-mRNA splicing.,"Pre-mRNA-splicing and adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) RNA-editing occur mostly cotranscriptionally. During A-to-I editing, a genomically encoded adenosine is deaminated to inosine by adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs). Editing-competent stems are frequently formed between exons and introns. Consistently, studies using reporter assays have shown that splicing efficiency can affect editing levels. Here, we use Nascent-seq and identify ∼90,000 novel A-to-I editing events in the mouse brain transcriptome. Most novel sites are located in intronic regions. Unlike previously assumed, we show that both ADAR (ADAR1) and ADARB1 (ADAR2) can edit repeat elements and regular transcripts to the same extent. We find that inhibition of splicing primarily increases editing levels at hundreds of sites, suggesting that reduced splicing efficiency extends the exposure of intronic and exonic sequences to ADAR enzymes. Lack of splicing factors NOVA1 or NOVA2 changes global editing levels, demonstrating that alternative splicing factors can modulate RNA editing. Finally, we show that intron retention rates correlate with editing levels across different brain tissues. We therefore demonstrate that splicing efficiency is a major factor controlling tissue-specific differences in editing levels.",2019 Sep,Genome Res. 2019 Sep;29(9):1453-1463. doi: 10.1101/gr.242636.118.

It has been reported that exposure to Cr(VI) can produce some chromium intermediates and reactive oxygen species (ROS), which causes DNA damages, genetic instability, and eventually leads to the elevated risk of various diseases including cancers. In recent years, it has been proposed that epigenetic-based mechanisms may involve in the toxic heavy metals-induced cytotoxicity and mutagenicity besides the genetic-based mechanisms. However, whether Cr(VI) could impose its cytotoxic effect through dysregulating the RNA epigenetic modifications remains poorly defined. We systematically investigated the effects of Cr(VI) exposure on 14 kinds of modifications in mRNA of HEK293T cells. We found that Cr(VI) exposure can induce an obvious decrease of inosine in mRNA. In addition, we observed that the expression level of the adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR1) was significantly decreased upon Cr(VI) exposure, which could be responsible for the induced decrease of inosine in mRNA by Cr(VI) exposure. Together, we demonstrated that Cr(VI) could interrupt A-to-I RNA editing in mRNA, which may eventually lead to the cytotoxicity and mutagenicity.",2019 Oct 21,Chem Res Toxicol. 2019 Oct 21;32(10):2078-2085. doi: 10.1021/acs.chemrestox.9b00249.

31614652,Structural Pattern Differences in Unbranched Rod-like RNA of Hepatitis Delta Virus affect RNA Editing.,"Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) RNA forms an unbranched rod-like structure and complexes with the delta antigen (HDAg). Host ADAR1-catalyzed RNA editing at the amber/W site of the small HDAg leads to the production of the large HDAg, which inhibits replication and is required for virion assembly. For HDV genotype 1, amber/W editing is controlled by HDAg and the RNA structure immediate vicinity and downstream of the editing site. Here, the effects of 20 mutants carrying an increased length of consecutive base-pairing at various sites in HDV RNA on amber/W site editing were examined. All nine mutants carrying genomic regions that formed up to 15 consecutive base pairs, which is also the maximum length observed in 41 naturally occurring HDV genomes, showed normal editing rate. However, mutants carrying a 16 or 17 consecutive base-paired antigenomic segment located as far as 114 nt upstream could increase editing efficiency, possibly by interfering with HDAg binding. These data show for the first time that extended base-pairing upstream of the amber/W site could increase HDV RNA editing efficiency. Furthermore, it appears that the naturally occurring HDV RNA structures have been selected for suboptimal amber/W RNA editing, which favors the HDV replication cycle.",2019 Oct 11,Viruses. 2019 Oct 11;11(10):934. doi: 10.3390/v11100934.,"['Hsu CW', 'Juang HH', 'Kuo CY', 'Li HP', 'Iang SB', 'Lin SH', 'Yeh CT', 'Chao M']",False
30448461,ADAR2-dependent A-to-I RNA editing in the extracellular linear and circular RNAs.,"Currently, no reliable biomarkers of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) exist. In sporadic ALS, RNA editing at the glutamine/arginine site of GluA2 mRNA is specifically reduced in the motor neurons due to the downregulation of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 2 (ADAR2). Furthermore, TDP-43 pathology, the pathological hallmark of ALS, is observed in the ADAR2-lacking motor neurons in ALS patients and conditional ADAR2 knockout mice, suggesting a pivotal role of ADAR2 downregulation in the ALS pathogenesis. Extracellular RNAs were shown to represent potential disease biomarkers and the editing efficiencies at their ADAR2-dependent sites may reflect cellular ADAR2 activity, suggesting that these RNAs isolated from the body fluids may represent the biomarkers of ALS. We searched for ADAR2-dependent sites in the mouse motor neurons and human-derived cultured cells and found 10 sites in five host RNAs expressed in SH-SY5Y cells and their culture medium. Of these, the arginine/glycine site of SON mRNA was newly identified as an ADAR2-dependent site. Furthermore, we detected a circular RNA with an ADAR2-dependent site in the SH-SY5Y cells and their culture medium.

31145970,Ammonium induced dysfunction of 5-HT(2B) receptor in astrocytes.,"Previously we reported that gene expression of astrocytic 5-HT(2B) receptors was decreased in brains of depressed animals exposed to chronic mild stress (CMS) (Li et al., 2012) and of Parkinson's disease (Song et al., 2018). Depression is also one of the psychiatric symptoms in hyperammonemia, and astrocyte is a primary target of ammonium in brain in vivo. In the present study, we have used preparations of the brains of urease-treated mice and ammonium-treated astrocytes in culture to study gene expression and function of 5-HT(2B) receptors. The urease-treated mice showed depressive behaviour. Both mRNA and protein of 5-HT(2B) receptors were increased in the brains of urease-treated mice and in ammonium-treated cultured astrocytes. Further study revealed that mRNA and protein expression of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 2 (ADAR2), an enzyme catalyze RNA deamination of adenosine to inosine was increased in the brains of urease-treated mice and in ammonium-treated cultured astrocytes. This increase in ADAR2 induced RNA editing of 5-HT(2B) receptors. Cultured astrocytes treated with ammonium lost 5-HT induced Ca(2+) signalling and ERK(1/2) phosphorylation, indicating dysfunction of 5-HT(2B) receptors. This is in agreement with our previous observation that edited 5-HT(2B) receptors no longer respond to 5-HT (Hertz et al., 2014). Ammonium effects are inhibited by ADAR2 siRNA in cultured astrocytes, suggesting that increased gene expression and editing and loss of function of 5-HT(2B) receptors are results of increased activity of ADAR2. In summary, we have demonstrated that functional malfunction of astrocytic 5-HT(2B) receptors occurs in animal models of major depression, Parkinson depression and hepatic encephalopathy albeit via different mechanisms. Understanding the role of astrocytic 5-HT(2B) receptors in different pathological contexts may instigate development of novel therapeutic strategies for treating disease-specific depressive behaviour.",2019 Oct,Neurochem Int. 2019 Oct;129:104479. doi: 10.1016/j.neuint.2019.104479.

31355950,Large-scale potential RNA editing profiling in different adult chicken tissues.,"RNA editing is a post-transcription maturation process that diversifies genomically encoded information and can lead to transcriptome diversity. Thanks to next-generation sequencing technologies, a large number of editing sites have been identified in different species. Although this mechanism is well described in mammals, only a few studies have been performed in chicken. Here, candidate or potential RNA editing sites were identified in eight different tissues of chicken (brain, spleen, colon, lung, kidney, heart, testes and liver). We identified 68 A-to-G editing sites in 46 genes. Only two of these were previously reported in chicken. We found no C-to-T sites, attesting to the lack of this type of editing mechanism in chicken. Similar to mammals, the editing sites were enriched in non-coding regions, rarely resulted in a change in amino acids, showed a critical role in the nervous system and had a low guanosine level upstream of the editing site and some enrichment downstream from the site. Moreover, in contrast to mammals, editing sites were weakly enriched in interspersed repeats and the number and editing ratio of non-synonymous sites were higher than for those of synonymous sites. Interestingly, we found several tissue-specific edited genes, including GABRA3, SORL1 and HTR1D in brain and RYR2 and FHOD3 in heart, that were associated with functional processes relevant to the corresponding tissue. This finding highlights the importance of RNA editing in several chicken tissues, especially the brain, and establishes a foundation for further exploration of this process.",2019 Oct,Anim Genet. 2019 Oct;50(5):460-474. doi: 10.1111/age.12818.

31423758,Seven novel mutations of ADAR in multi-ethnic pedigrees with dyschromatosis symmetrica hereditaria in China.,"BACKGROUND: Dyschromatosis symmetrica hereditaria (DSH;OMIM: #127400) is a rare autosomal dominant skin disease of hyperpigmented and hypopigmented macules on the dorsal aspects of the feet and hands. The adenosine deaminase RNA-Specific (ADAR;OMIM: *146920) gene was identified as causing DSH. Although more than 200 mutations are reported, no research has included the pedigrees of ethnic minorities in China. To investigate clinical features and genetic factors among multi-ethnic families, seven multi-ethnic pedigrees with DSH were collected for analysis of hereditary characteristics and ADAR mutations. METHODS: All 15 exons and exon-intron sequences of the ADAR gene were amplified and Sanger sequenced from 25 patients and 36 normal controls from seven multi-ethnic DSH families with 100 healthy normal controls. Seven mutations were analyzed by Polyphen 2, SIFT and Provean. All mutations in ADAR with DSH were reviewed and genetic and clinical features were summarized for analysis. The ADEAMc domain may be a hot spot of ADAR mutations among patients with DSH. RESULTS: Seven novel mutations were identified in seven multi-ethnic pedigrees: c.497delA(p.Arg105fs), c.3352C>T(p.Gln1058*) and c.3722delT(p.Ser1181fs) were found in three Uygur families with DSH; c.1330A>G(p.Val332Met) and c.2702A>T(p.His841Leu) were found in two Kazakh pedigrees and c.1176G>A(p.Lys326Glu) and c.2861G>A(p.Arg892His) in two Hui pedigrees. We summarized 203 different mutations of ADAR from people with DSH. CONCLUSIONS: Seven novel mutations were identified in seven multi-ethnic families with DSH.

31658304,"Infectious vaccine-derived rubella viruses emerge, persist, and evolve in cutaneous granulomas of children with primary immunodeficiencies.","Rubella viruses (RV) have been found in an association with granulomas in children with primary immune deficiencies (PID). Here, we report the recovery and characterization of infectious immunodeficiency-related vaccine-derived rubella viruses (iVDRV) from diagnostic skin biopsies of four patients. Sequence evolution within PID hosts was studied by comparison of the complete genomic sequences of the iVDRVs with the genome of the vaccine virus RA27/3. The degree of divergence of each iVDRV correlated with the duration of persistence indicating continuous intrahost evolution. The evolution rates for synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions were estimated to be 5.7 x 10-3 subs/site/year and 8.9 x 10-4 subs/site/year, respectively. Mutational spectra and signatures indicated a major role for APOBEC cytidine deaminases and a secondary role for ADAR adenosine deaminases in generating diversity of iVDRVs. The distributions of mutations across the genes and 3D hotspots for amino acid substitutions in the E1 glycoprotein identified regions that may be under positive selective pressure. Quasispecies diversity was higher in granulomas than in recovered infectious iVDRVs. Growth properties of iVDRVs were assessed in WI-38 fibroblast cultures. None of the iVDRV isolates showed complete reversion to wild type phenotype but the replicative and persistence characteristics of iVDRVs were different from those of the RA27/3 vaccine strain, making predictions of iVDRV transmissibility and teratogenicity difficult. However, detection of iVDRV RNA in nasopharyngeal specimen and poor neutralization of some iVDRV strains by sera from vaccinated persons suggests possible public health risks associated with iVDRV carriers. Detection of IgM antibody to RV in sera of two out of three patients may be a marker of virus persistence, potentially useful for identifying patients with iVDRV before development of lesions. Studies of the evolutionary dynamics of iVDRV during persistence will contribute to development of infection control strategies and antiviral therapies.",2019 Oct,PLoS Pathog. 2019 Oct 28;15(10):e1008080. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1008080. eCollection 2019 Oct.,"['Perelygina L', 'Chen MH', 'Suppiah S', 'Adebayo A', 'Abernathy E', 'Dorsey M', 'Bercovitch L', 'Paris K', 'White KP', 'Krol A', 'Dhossche J', 'Torshin IY', 'Saini N', 'Klimczak LJ', 'Gordenin DA', 'Zharkikh A', 'Plotkin S', 'Sullivan KE', 'Icenogle J']",False
30952201,Neuropathological Findings in a Case of IFIH1-Related Aicardi-Goutières Syndrome.,"Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS) is a rare syndrome characterized by calcification, diffuse demyelination, and variable degree of brain atrophy. The syndrome is genetically heterogeneous with mutations in 7 genes, including TREX1, RNASEH2A, RNASEH2B, RNASEH2C, SAMHD1, ADAR1, and IFIH1 (interferon-induced helicase c domain-containing protein 1) associated with the syndrome, so far. These mutations lead to the overproduction of α-interferon within the central nervous system. Mutations in IFIH1 have been recently described in a subset of AGS, with only 1 previous report of neuropathological findings. We report neuropathological findings in a second case of AGS with a known mutation in IFIH1 gene. The patient is a 16-year-old adolescent boy with early-onset symptoms that progressed to profound loss of cognitive and motor functions. The patient experienced sudden cardiopulmonary arrest at the age of 16 years. At autopsy, the cause of death was determined to be pulmonary thromboembolism. Neuropathological examination revealed microcephaly (brain weight: 916 g) with relatively mild brain atrophy on gross examination. Microscopic examination revealed multifocal calcifications limited to small to medium central nervous system arteries (no evidence of calcification in other organs), involving bilateral cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, thalamus, and cerebellum. Ultrastructural examination showed Calcospherules limited to the vessel walls and the perivasulcar area without evidence of neuronal ferrugination or tubuloreticular bodies. The extent of calcifications was variable across different brain regions, resembling findings in previously reported cases and correlated with the extent of IFIH1 protein expression (data derived from Allen Brain Institute). AGS is a rare cause of brain calcifications that can closely mimic congenital and neonatal infections such as Rubella and similar infections.",2019 Nov-Dec,Pediatr Dev Pathol. 2019 Nov-Dec;22(6):566-570. doi: 10.1177/1093526619837797.

31636123,Double-stranded RNA deaminase ADAR1 promotes the Zika virus replication by inhibiting the activation of protein kinase PKR.,"Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that has emerged as a threat to global health. The family of adenosine deaminases acting on dsRNA (ADARs) are human host factors important for the genetic diversity and evolution of ZIKV. Here, we further investigated the role of ADAR1 in ZIKV replication by utilizing CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing and RNAi-based gene knockdown techniques. Both ADAR1 knockout and knockdown significantly reduced ZIKV RNA synthesis, protein levels, and viral titers in several human cell lines. Trans-complementation with the full-length ADAR1 form p150 or the shorter form p110 lacking the Zα domain restored viral replication levels suppressed by the ADAR1 knockout. Moreover, we observed that the nuclear p110 form was redistributed to the cytoplasm in response to ZIKV infection. ADAR1 was not involved in viral entry but promoted viral protein translation by impairing ZIKV-induced activation of protein kinase regulated by dsRNA (PKR). Of note, the RNA-editing activity of ADAR1 was not required to promote ZIKV replication. We also found that the proviral role of ADAR1 was partially mediated through its ability to suppress IFN production and PKR activation. Our work identifies ADAR1 as a proviral factor involved in ZIKV replication, suggesting that ADAR1 could be a potential antiviral target.",2019 Nov 29,J Biol Chem. 2019 Nov 29;294(48):18168-18180. doi: 10.1074/jbc.RA119.009113.

31795425,Investigation of RNA Editing Sites within Bound Regions of RNA-Binding Proteins.,"Studies in epitranscriptomics indicate that RNA is modified by a variety of enzymes. Among these RNA modifications, adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing occurs frequently in the mammalian transcriptome. These RNA editing sites can be detected directly from RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data by examining nucleotide changes from adenosine (A) to guanine (G), which substitutes for inosine (I). However, a careful investigation of such nucleotide changes must be conducted to distinguish sequencing errors and genomic mutations from the genuine editing sites. Building upon our recent introduction of an easy-to-use bioinformatics tool, RNA Editor, to detect RNA editing events from RNA-seq data, we examined the extent by which RNA editing events affect the binding of RNA-binding proteins (RBP). Through employing bioinformatic techniques, we uncovered that RNA editing sites occur frequently in RBP-bound regions. Moreover, the presence of RNA editing sites are more frequent when RNA editing islands were examined, which are regions in which RNA editing sites are present in clusters. When the binding of one RBP, human antigen R [HuR; encoded by ELAV-like protein 1 (ELAV1)], was quantified experimentally, its binding was reduced upon silencing of the RNA editing enzyme adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADAR) compared to the control-suggesting that the presence of RNA editing islands influence HuR binding to its target regions. These data indicate RNA editing as an important mediator of RBP-RNA interactions-a mechanism which likely constitutes an additional mode of post-transcription gene regulation in biological systems.",2019 Nov 29,High Throughput. 2019 Nov 29;8(4):19. doi: 10.3390/ht8040019.,"['Weirick T', 'Militello G', 'Hosen MR', 'John D', 'Moore Iv JB', 'Uchida S']",False
31346607,Inosine RNA modifications are enriched at the codon wobble position in mouse oocytes and eggs†.,"Mammalian oocytes and eggs are transcriptionally quiescent and depend on post-transcriptional mechanisms for proper maturation. Post-transcriptional mRNA modifications comprise an important regulatory mechanism that can alter protein and miRNA recognition sites, splicing, stability, secondary structure, and protein coding. We discovered that fully grown mouse germinal vesicle oocytes and metaphase II eggs display abundant inosine mRNA modifications compared to growing oocytes from postnatal day 12 oocytes. These inosines were enriched in mRNA protein coding regions (CDS) and specifically located at the third codon base, or wobble position. Inosines, observed at lower frequencies in CDS of somatic tissues, were similarly enriched at the codon wobble position. In oocytes and eggs, inosine modifications lead primarily to synonymous changes in mRNA transcripts. Inosines may ultimately affect maternal mRNA stability by changing codon usage, thereby altering translational efficiency and translationally coupled mRNA degradation. These important observations advance our understanding of post-transcriptional mechanisms contributing to mammalian oocyte maturation.",2019 Nov 21,Biol Reprod. 2019 Nov 21;101(5):938-949. doi: 10.1093/biolre/ioz130.,"['Brachova P', 'Alvarez NS', 'Hong X', 'Gunewardena S', 'Vincent KA', 'Latham KE', 'Christenson LK']",False
31552420,RNA binding candidates for human ADAR3 from substrates of a gain of function mutant expressed in neuronal cells.,"Human ADAR3 is a catalytically inactive member of the Adenosine Deaminase Acting on RNA (ADAR) protein family, whose active members catalyze A-to-I RNA editing in metazoans. Until now, the reasons for the catalytic incapability of ADAR3 has not been defined and its biological function rarely explored. Yet, its exclusive expression in the brain and involvement in learning and memory suggest a central role in the nervous system. Here we describe the engineering of a catalytically active ADAR3 enzyme using a combination of computational design and functional screening. Five mutations (A389V, V485I, E527Q, Q549R and Q733D) engender RNA deaminase in human ADAR3. By way of its catalytic activity, the ADAR3 pentamutant was used to identify potential binding targets for wild type ADAR3 in a human glioblastoma cell line. Novel ADAR3 binding sites discovered in this manner include the 3'-UTRs of the mRNAs encoding early growth response 1 (EGR1) and dual specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1); both known to be activity-dependent immediate early genes that respond to stimuli in the brain.

ADAR2 regulates Ca(2+) influx through α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptors via adenosine-to-inosine conversion at the glutamine/arginine site of GluA2 mRNA, which makes ADAR2 a key factor in acquired Ca(2+) resistance in motor neurons. Deficient ADAR2 of sALS motor neurons is supposed to lead to excessive Ca(2+) influx through AMPA receptors, resulting in TDP-43 pathology and nuclear pore complex pathology, and eventually motor neuronal death. We considered that AMPA receptor antagonists could strongly prevent excessive Ca(2+) influx through AMPA receptors and block motor neuronal degeneration in sALS. Perampanel, a selective non-competitive AMPA receptor antagonist, has been reported to prevent deterioration in a mouse model for sALS, in which ADAR2 is conditionally knocked out in motor neurons. Because of the therapeutic potency of perampanel for sporadic ALS, we have performed a multicenter randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel-group phase 2 clinical trial.

OBJECTIVE: To examine visual exploration during simulated driving in adolescents with and without ADHD. DESIGN: Adolescents with and without ADHD drove a driving simulator for approximately 10 min while their gaze was monitored. They then completed a battery of questionnaires. SETTING: University lab.

OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We compared the following measures between ADHD and non-ADHD groups: dashboard dwell times, fixation variance, entropy, and fixation duration. RESULTS: Findings showed that participants with ADHD were more restricted in their patterns of exploration than control group participants. They spent considerably more time gazing at the dashboard and had longer periods of fixation with lower variability and randomness.

30617847,Evidence for an association of interferon gene variants with sudden infant death syndrome.,"BACKGROUND: There is evidence that inflammation plays a role in the etiology of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Immune system dysregulation seems to be the background of higher infection susceptibility in SIDS infants. This phenotype is possibly determined by genetic factors. METHODS: Twenty-three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the following 13 candidate genes governing the immune system were successfully genotyped in 251 Caucasian SIDS cases and 336 controls from Germany: ADAR1, CSF2RB, DDX58, IFNA1, IFNA21, IFNA8, IFNAR2, IFNG, IL6, MX2, OAS1, OAS3, and TNFA. Associations between genotypes and SIDS were then statistically evaluated using logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Overall analysis revealed statistically significant results for two variants in interferon gamma (IFNG) (rs2069705: OR 1.40 (1.07; 1.83), p = 0.01; and rs2069727: OR 0.75 (0.59; 0.96), p = 0.02) and for one variant in interferon alpha 8 (IFNA8) (rs1330321: OR 1.85 (1.06; 3.21), p = 0.03).

However, how this transcriptome recoding process is functionally correlated with tumorigenesis remains largely elusive. Our analyses of RNA editome datasets identify hypoxia-related genes as A-to-I editing targets. In particular, two negative regulators of HIF-1A-the natural antisense transcript HIF1A-AS2 and the ubiquitin ligase scaffold LIMD1-are directly but differentially modulated by ADAR1. We show that HIF1A-AS2 antagonizes the expression of HIF-1A in the immediate-early phase of hypoxic challenge, likely through a convergent transcription competition in cis ADAR1 in turn suppresses transcriptional progression of the antisense gene. In contrast, ADAR1 affects LIMD1 expression post-transcriptionally, by interfering with the cytoplasmic translocation of LIMD1 mRNA and thus protein translation. This multi-tier regulation coordinated by ADAR1 promotes robust and timely accumulation of HIF-1α upon oxygen depletion and reinforces target gene induction and downstream angiogenesis.

By diminishing the production of interferon (IFN) and other inflammatory mediators, tumors enhance immune evasion. Responses initiated by nucleic acid sensors and triggered by dysregulated RNA transcription and cytoplasmic DNA undergo down-modulation in tumors. A protein hub that involves the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) editing enzyme adenosine deaminase RNA specific (ADAR), the RNase DICER1, and the dsRNA-activated kinase protein activator of PKR (PACT) mediates many of these tumor-intrinsic responses, with in vitro ADAR dependency varying by tumor type (range 11-80%). The central role played by ADAR, both as an enzyme and as a scaffold, sets it as a target for cancer immunotherapy. Therapeutic approaches focusing on the ADAR p150 isoform and its Z-DNA- and Z-RNA-specific Zα domain find support from recent mouse and human studies.",2019 May,Trends Cancer. 2019 May;5(5):272-282. doi: 10.1016/j.trecan.2019.03.004.

30814222,OAS-RNase L innate immune pathway mediates the cytotoxicity of a DNA-demethylating drug.,"Drugs that reverse epigenetic silencing, such as the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) 5-azacytidine (AZA), have profound effects on transcription and tumor cell survival. AZA is an approved drug for myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia, and is under investigation for different solid malignant tumors. AZA treatment generates self, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), transcribed from hypomethylated repetitive elements. Self dsRNA accumulation in DNMTi-treated cells leads to type I IFN production and IFN-stimulated gene expression. Here we report that cell death in response to AZA treatment occurs through the 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)-RNase L pathway. OASs are IFN-induced enzymes that synthesize the RNase L activator 2-5A in response to dsRNA. Cells deficient in RNase L or OAS1 to 3 are highly resistant to AZA, as are wild-type cells treated with a small-molecule inhibitor of RNase L. A small-molecule inhibitor of c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinases (JNKs) also antagonizes RNase L-dependent cell death in response to AZA, consistent with a role for JNK in RNase L-induced apoptosis. In contrast, the rates of AZA-induced and RNase L-dependent cell death were increased by transfection of 2-5A, by deficiencies in ADAR1 (which edits and destabilizes dsRNA), PDE12 or AKAP7 (which degrade 2-5A), or by ionizing radiation (which induces IFN-dependent signaling). Finally, OAS1 expression correlates with AZA sensitivity in the NCI-60 set of tumor cell lines, suggesting that the level of OAS1 can be a biomarker for predicting AZA sensitivity of tumor cells. These studies may eventually lead to pharmacologic strategies for regulating the antitumor activity and toxicity of AZA and related drugs.",2019 Mar 12,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2019 Mar 12;116(11):5071-5076. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1815071116.

30862860,Ectopic expression of Snord115 in choroid plexus interferes with editing but not splicing of 5-Ht2c receptor pre-mRNA in mice.,"Serotonin 5-HT2C receptor is a G-protein coupled excitatory receptor that regulates several biochemical pathways and has been implicated in obesity, mental state, sleep cycles, autism, neuropsychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. The activity of 5-HT2CR is regulated via alternative splicing and A to I editing of exon Vb of its pre-mRNA. Snord115 is a small nucleolar RNA that is expressed in mouse neurons and displays an 18-nucleotide base complementary to exon Vb of 5-HT2CR pre-mRNA. For almost two decades this putative guide element of Snord115 has wandered like a ghost through the literature in attempts to elucidate the biological significance of this complementarity. In mice, Snord115 is expressed in neurons and absent in the choroid plexus where, in contrast, 5-Ht2cr mRNA is highly abundant. Here we report the analysis of 5-Ht2cr pre-mRNA posttranscriptional processing via RNA deep sequencing in a mouse model that ectopically expresses Snord115 in the choroid plexus. In contrast to previous reports, our analysis demonstrated that Snord115 does not control alternative splicing of 5-Ht2cr pre-mRNA in vivo. We identified a modest, yet statistically significant reduction of 5-Ht2cr pre-mRNA A to I editing at the major A, B, C and D sites. We suggest that Snord115 and exon Vb of 5Ht2cr pre-mRNA form a double-stranded structure that is subject to ADAR-mediated A to I editing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive Snord115 gain-of-function analysis based on in vivo mouse models.",2019 Mar 12,Sci Rep. 2019 Mar 12;9(1):4300. doi: 10.1038/s41598-019-39940-6.,"['Raabe CA', 'Voss R', 'Kummerfeld DM', 'Brosius J', 'Galiveti CR', 'Wolters A', 'Seggewiss J', 'Huge A', 'Skryabin BV', 'Rozhdestvensky TS']",False
30465820,Computational approaches for detection and quantification of A-to-I RNA-editing.,"Adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADARs) catalyze adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing in double-stranded RNA. Such editing is important for protection against false activation of the immune system, but also confers plasticity on the transcriptome by generating several versions of a transcript from a single genomic locus. Recently, great efforts were made in developing computational methods for detecting editing events directly from RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data. These efforts have led to an improved understanding of the makeup of the editome in various genomes. Here we review recent advances in editing detection based on the data available to the researcher, with emphasis on the principles underlying the various methods and the limitations they were designed to overcome. We also discuss the available various methods for analyzing and quantifying editing levels.

30502398,Current strategies for Site-Directed RNA Editing using ADARs.,"Adenosine Deaminases that Act on RNA (ADARs) are a group of enzymes that catalyze the conversion of adenosines (A's) to inosines (I's) in a process known as RNA editing. Though ADARs can act on different types of RNA, editing events in coding regions of mRNA are of particular interest as I's base pair like guanosines (G's). Thus, every A-to-I change catalyzed by ADAR is read as an A-to-G change during translation, potentially altering protein sequence and function. This ability to re-code makes ADAR an attractive therapeutic tool to correct genetic mutations within mRNA. The main challenge in doing so is to re-direct ADAR's catalytic activity towards A's that are not naturally edited, a process termed Site-Directed RNA Editing (SDRE). Recently, a handful of labs have taken up this challenge and two basic strategies have emerged. The first involves redirecting endogenous ADAR to new sites by making editable structures using antisense RNA oligonucleotides. The second also utilizes antisense RNA oligonucleotides, but it uses them as guides to deliver the catalytic domain of engineered ADARs to new sites, much as CRISPR guides deliver Cas nucleases. In fact, despite the intense current focus on CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing, SDRE offers a number of distinct advantages. In the present review we will discuss these strategies in greater detail, focusing on the concepts on which they are based, how they were developed and tested, and their respective advantages and disadvantages. Though the precise and efficient re-direction of ADAR activity still remains a challenge, the systems that are being developed lay the foundation for SDRE as a powerful tool for transient genome editing.",2019 Mar 1,Methods. 2019 Mar 1;156:16-24. doi: 10.1016/j.ymeth.2018.11.016.

30583079,Activation of AZIN1 RNA editing is a novel mechanism that promotes invasive potential of cancer-associated fibroblasts in colorectal cancer.,"Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing is a recently described epigenetic modification, which is believed to constitute a key oncogenic mechanism in human cancers. However, its functional role in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) within the tumor microenvironment (TME) and its clinical significance remains unclear. Herein, we systematically analyzed a large cohort of 627 colorectal cancer (CRC) specimens, and investigated the expression pattern of ADAR1 and its biological significance on the antizyme inhibitor 1 (AZIN1) RNA editing levels. Both ADAR1 expression and AZIN1 RNA editing levels were significantly elevated in CRC tissues vs. normal mucosa, and these findings correlated with the increased expression of mesenchymal markers, Vimentin (ρ = 0.44) and Fibroblast activation protein (ρ = 0.38). Intriguingly, ADAR1 expression was specifically upregulated in both cancer cells and fibroblasts from cancerous lesions. Conditioned medium from cancer cells led to induction of ADAR1 expression and activation of AZIN1 RNA editing in fibroblasts (p < 0.05). Additionally, edited AZIN1 enhanced the invasive potential of fibroblasts. In conclusion, we provide novel evidence that hyper-editing of AZIN1 enhances the invasive potential of CAFs within the TME in colon and is an important predictor of tumor invasiveness in CRC.",2019 Mar 1,Cancer Lett. 2019 Mar 1;444:127-135. doi: 10.1016/j.canlet.2018.12.009.

Functions of long, cellular dsRNAs are poorly understood, although deficiencies in adenosine deaminases that act on RNA, or ADARs, promote their recognition as viral dsRNA and an aberrant immune response. Diverse dsRNA-binding proteins bind cellular dsRNAs, hinting at additional roles. Understanding these roles is facilitated by mapping the genomic locations that express dsRNA in various tissues and organisms. ADAR editing provides a signature of dsRNA structure in cellular transcripts.

30827465,Using mouse models to unlock the secrets of non-synonymous RNA editing.,"The deamination of adenosine to inosine by RNA editing is a widespread post-transcriptional process that expands genetic diversity. Selective substitution of inosine for adenosine in pre-mRNA transcripts can alter splicing, mRNA stability, and the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein. The functional consequences of RNA editing-dependent amino acid substitution are known for only a handful of RNA editing substrates. Many of these studies began in heterologous mammalian expression systems; however, the gold-standard for determining the functional significance of transcript-specific re-coding A-to-I editing events is the generation of a mouse model that expresses only one RNA editing-dependent isoform. The frequency of site-specific RNA editing varies spatially, temporally, and in some diseases, therefore, determining the profile of RNA editing frequency is also an important element of research. Here we review the strengths and weaknesses of existing mouse models for the study of RNA editing, as well as methods for quantifying RNA editing frequencies in vivo. Importantly, we highlight opportunities for future RNA editing studies in mice, projecting that improvements in genome editing and high-throughput sequencing technologies will allow the field to excel in coming years.",2019 Mar 1,Methods. 2019 Mar 1;156:40-45. doi: 10.1016/j.ymeth.2018.10.016.

However, the current knowledge on mollusk viruses is mainly centered on few pathogenic viruses, whereas a general view of bivalve-associated viromes is lacking. This study was designed to explore the viral abundance and diversity in bivalve mollusks using transcriptomic datasets. From analyzing RNA-seq data of 58 bivalve species, we have reconstructed 26 nearly complete and over 413 partial RNA virus genomes. Although 96.4% of the predicted viral proteins refer to new viruses, some sequences belong to viruses associated with bivalve species or other marine invertebrates. We considered short non-coding RNAs (sncRNA) and post-transcriptional modifications occurring specifically on viral RNAs as tools for virus host-assignment. We could not identify virus-derived small RNAs in sncRNA reads obtained from the oyster sample richest in viral reads. Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) analysis revealed 938 A-to-G substitutions occurring on the 26 identified RNA viruses, preferentially impacting the AA di-nucleotide motif. Under-representation analysis revealed that the AA motif is under-represented in these bivalve-associated viruses.

30391332,"ADAR RNA editing in innate immune response phasing, in circadian clocks and in sleep.","Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) convert adenosine to inosine in dsRNA. ADAR editing in pre-mRNAs recodes open reading frames and alters splicing, mRNA structure and interactions with miRNAs. Here, we review ADAR gene expression, splice forms, posttranslational modifications, subcellular localizations and functions of ADAR protein isoforms. ADAR1 edits cellular dsRNA to prevent aberrant activation of cytoplasmic antiviral dsRNA sensors; ADAR1 mutations lead to aberrant expression of interferon in Aicardi Goutières syndrome (AGS), a human congenital encephalopathy. We review related studies on mouse Adar1 mutant phenotypes, their rescues by preventing signaling from the antiviral RIG-I-like Sensors (RLRs), as well as Adar1 mechanisms in innate immune suppression and other roles of Adar1, including editing-independent effects. ADAR2, expressed primarily in CNS, edits glutamate receptor transcripts; regulation of ADAR2 activity in response to neuronal activity mediates homeostatic synaptic plasticity of vertebrate AMPA and kainite receptors. In Drosophila, synapses and synaptic proteins show dramatic decreases at night during sleep; Drosophila Adar, an orthologue of ADAR2, edits hundreds of mRNAs; the most conserved editing events occur in transcripts encoding synapse-associated proteins. Adar mutant flies exhibit locomotion defects associated with very increased sleep pressure resulting from a failure of homeostatic synaptic processes. A study on Adar2 mutant mice identifies a new role in circadian rhythms, acting indirectly through miRNAs such as let-7 to modulate levels of let-7 target mRNAs; ADAR1 also regulates let-7 miRNA processing.

Some cytoplasmic dsRNA is commonly present in cells, and one source is mitochondrial dsRNA, which results from bidirectional transcription of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Here we demonstrate that Trp53 mutant mouse embryonic fibroblasts contain immune-stimulating endogenous dsRNA of mitochondrial origin. We show that the immune response induced by this dsRNA is mediated via RIG-I-like receptors and leads to the expression of type I interferon and proinflammatory cytokine genes. The mitochondrial dsRNA is cleaved by RNase L, which cleaves all cellular RNA including mitochondrial mRNAs, increasing activation of RIG-I-like receptors. When mitochondrial transcription is interrupted there is a subsequent decrease in this immune-stimulatory dsRNA.

Previous studies have demonstrated that the expression of ADAR1 is increased in glioma, and ADAR1 short hairpin RNA affects regulated cellular exocytosis. This indicates that ADAR1 might be involved in cellular proliferation and/or apoptosis. METHOD: To investigate the molecular mechanism by which ADAR1 is activity dependent, we applied the primary neuron culture and coculture with astrocytes and the RNA chipset to explore the underlying mechanism. RESULTS: We found that in primary cultured neurons, the excitotoxicity induced by kainic acid (KA) increased the cellular calcium concentration determined by flow cytometry, and cocultured astrocyte could decrease the calcium concentration in KA-treated neurons. In addition, we applied RNA chipset and found KA decreased the ADAR1 and signal transducer and activator of transcription 2 (STAT2) expression and cocultured astrocytes could increase the insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 expression and reverse the reduced ADAR1 and STAT2.

Recently, we found that there is a large interindividual variation in the expression of ADAR1 protein in the human livers. In this study, we investigated the possibility that A-to-I RNA editing may modulate the expression of cytochrome P450 (P450), causing interindividual variations in drug metabolism potencies. We found that knockdown of ADAR1 or ADAR2 in HepaRG cells resulted in the decreased expression of CYP2B6 and CYP2C8 mRNA and protein. Knockdown of ADARs significantly decreased the stability of CYP2B6 mRNA but not CYP2C8 mRNA. Luciferase assays revealed that the 3'-untranslated region of CYP2B6 and the promoter region of CYP2C8 would be involved in the decrease in their expression by the knockdown of ADARs. We found that the decreased expression of the hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α) protein by the knockdown of ADARs was one of the reasons for the decreased transactivity of CYP2C8. The mRNA levels of other P450 isoforms, such as CYP2A6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 2E1, which are known to be regulated by HNF4α, were also decreased by ADAR1 or ADAR2 knockdown. Exceptionally, the CYP3A4 mRNA level was significantly increased by ADAR1 knockdown, suggesting the possibility that the change could be due to the change in the expression or function of other regulatory factors.

The hypothesis presented here suggests a new way of thinking about the role of host immune mechanisms in disease pathogenesis, focusing on dysregulation of post-transcriptional RNA editing as a candidate driver of a broad range of observed neurodevelopmental defects and neurodegenerative clinical symptoms in both infants and adults linked with ZIKV infections. The authors collect and synthesize existing evidence of ZIKV-mediated changes in the expression of adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs), known links between abnormal RNA editing and pathogenesis, as well as ideas for future research directions, including potential treatment strategies.",2019 Jun,Bioessays. 2019 Jun;41(6):e1800239. doi: 10.1002/bies.201800239.

30940614,Pediatric Evans syndrome is associated with a high frequency of potentially damaging variants in immune genes.,"Evans syndrome (ES) is a rare severe autoimmune disorder characterized by the combination of autoimmune hemolytic anemia and immune thrombocytopenia. In most cases, the underlying cause is unknown. We sought to identify genetic defects in pediatric ES (pES), based on a hypothesis of strong genetic determinism. In a national, prospective cohort of 203 patients with early-onset ES (median [range] age at last follow-up: 16.3 years ([1.2-41.0 years]) initiated in 2004, 80 nonselected consecutive individuals underwent genetic testing. The clinical data were analyzed as a function of the genetic findings. Fifty-two patients (65%) received a genetic diagnosis (the M+ group): 49 carried germline mutations and 3 carried somatic variants. Thirty-two (40%) had pathogenic mutations in 1 of 9 genes known to be involved in primary immunodeficiencies (TNFRSF6, CTLA4, STAT3, PIK3CD, CBL, ADAR1, LRBA, RAG1, and KRAS), whereas 20 patients (25%) carried probable pathogenic variants in 16 genes that had not previously been reported in the context of autoimmune disease. Lastly, no genetic abnormalities were found in the remaining 28 patients (35%, the M- group). The M+ group displayed more severe disease than the M- group, with a greater frequency of additional immunopathologic manifestations and a greater median number of lines of treatment. Six patients (all from the M+ group) died during the study. In conclusion, pES was potentially genetically determined in at least 65% of cases. Systematic, wide-ranging genetic screening should be offered in pES; the genetic findings have prognostic significance and may guide the choice of a targeted treatment.",2019 Jul 4,Blood. 2019 Jul 4;134(1):9-21. doi: 10.1182/blood-2018-11-887141.

Previously, we developed a programmable adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing approach by fusing catalytically inactivate RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas13 (dCas13) with the adenine deaminase domain of ADAR2. Here, we report a cytidine-to-uridine (C-to-U) RNA editor, referred to as RNA Editing for Specific C-to-U Exchange (RESCUE), by directly evolving ADAR2 into a cytidine deaminase. RESCUE doubles the number of mutations targetable by RNA editing and enables modulation of phosphosignaling-relevant residues. We apply RESCUE to drive β-catenin activation and cellular growth.

31337330,A-to-I editing of Malacoherpesviridae RNAs supports the antiviral role of ADAR1 in mollusks.,"BACKGROUND: Adenosine deaminase enzymes of the ADAR family are conserved in metazoans. They convert adenine into inosine in dsRNAs and thus alter both structural properties and the coding potential of their substrates. Acting on exogenous dsRNAs, ADAR1 exerts a pro- or anti-viral role in vertebrates and Drosophila. RESULTS: We traced 4 ADAR homologs in 14 lophotrochozoan genomes and we classified them into ADAD, ADAR1 or ADAR2, based on phylogenetic and structural analyses of the enzymatic domain. Using RNA-seq and quantitative real time PCR we demonstrated the upregulation of one ADAR1 homolog in the bivalve Crassostrea gigas and in the gastropod Haliotis diversicolor supertexta during Ostreid herpesvirus-1 or Haliotid herpesvirus-1 infection. Accordingly, we demonstrated an extensive ADAR-mediated editing of viral RNAs. Single nucleotide variation (SNV) profiles obtained by pairing RNA- and DNA-seq data from the viral infected individuals resulted to be mostly compatible with ADAR-mediated A-to-I editing (up to 97%). SNVs occurred at low frequency in genomic hotspots, denoted by the overlapping of viral genes encoded on opposite DNA strands. The SNV sites and their upstream neighbor nucleotide indicated the targeting of selected adenosines. The analysis of viral sequences suggested that, under the pressure of the ADAR editing, the two Malacoherpesviridae genomes have evolved to reduce the number of deamination targets. CONCLUSIONS: We report, for the first time, evidence of an extensive editing of Malacoherpesviridae RNAs attributable to host ADAR1 enzymes. The analysis of base neighbor preferences, structural features and expression profiles of molluscan ADAR1 supports the conservation of the enzyme function among metazoans and further suggested that ADAR1 exerts an antiviral role in mollusks.",2019 Jul 23,BMC Evol Biol. 2019 Jul 23;19(1):149. doi: 10.1186/s12862-019-1472-6.,"['Rosani U', 'Bai CM', 'Maso L', 'Shapiro M', 'Abbadi M', 'Domeneghetti S', 'Wang CM', 'Cendron L', 'MacCarthy T', 'Venier P']",True
31315644,ADAR1 promotes the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and stem-like cell phenotype of oral cancer by facilitating oncogenic microRNA maturation.,"BACKGROUND: Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) are involved in adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing and implicated in tumorigenesis and prognosis. Emerging evidence has indicated that ADAR1, an ADAR family member, participates in the regulation of various cancers; however, its biological function in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) remains unclear. This study aimed to determine the role of ADAR1 in OSCC progression. METHODS: ADAR1 expression in both normal tissues and carcinoma tissues and in OSCC cell lines was examined by real-time PCR and western blotting. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches were used to examine the effect of ADAR1 on the migration, invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and stemness of OSCC. Furthermore, the relationship between ADAR1 and Dicer was determined by co-immunoprecipitation, and the expression of OSCC-associated oncogenic miRNAs was evaluated by real-time PCR. For in vivo experiments, a xenograft model where OSCC cells stably expressing ADAR1 were implanted was used to investigate the effect of ADAR1 on tumor growth and progression, and the expression of ADAR1, PCNA, SOX2 and POU5F1 was further detected by immunohistochemistry. The impact of ADAR1 expression on the survival status of OSCC patients was determined by survival analysis. RESULTS: ADAR1 was overexpressed in OSCC and significantly associated with poor patient survival. There was a positive correlation between ADAR1 and the migration, invasion, EMT and stemness of OSCC. Mechanistically, ADAR1 was physically associated with Dicer, and six OSCC-associated oncogenic miRNAs were increased in OSCC cells with ADAR1 overexpression. In the mouse xenograft model of OSCC, ADAR1 overexpression promoted tumor growth and progression. Moreover, ADAR1 was highly expressed in OSCC patients with low survival rates. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrated that ADAR1 may play a significant role in OSCC progression via combining with Dicer to regulate oncogenic miRNA maturation and further affect cell migration and invasion.",2019 Jul 17,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2019 Jul 17;38(1):315. doi: 10.1186/s13046-019-1300-2.,"['Liu X', 'Fu Y', 'Huang J', 'Wu M', 'Zhang Z', 'Xu R', 'Zhang P', 'Zhao S', 'Liu L', 'Jiang H']",True
29944911,Cell death cascade and molecular therapy in ADAR2-deficient motor neurons of ALS.,"TAR DNA-binding protein (TDP-43) pathology in the motor neurons is the most reliable pathological hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and motor neurons bearing TDP-43 pathology invariably exhibit failure in RNA editing at the GluA2 glutamine/arginine (Q/R) site due to down-regulation of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 2 (ADAR2). Conditional ADAR2 knockout (AR2) mice display ALS-like phenotype, including progressive motor dysfunction due to loss of motor neurons. Motor neurons devoid of ADAR2 express Q/R site-unedited GluA2, and AMPA receptors with unedited GluA2 in their subunit assembly are abnormally permeable to Ca(2+), which results in progressive neuronal death. Moreover, analysis of AR2 mice has demonstrated that exaggerated Ca(2+) influx through the abnormal AMPA receptors overactivates calpain, a Ca(2+)-dependent protease, that cleaves TDP-43 into aggregation-prone fragments, which serve as seeds for TDP-43 pathology. Activated calpain also disrupts nucleo-cytoplasmic transport and gene expression by cleaving molecules involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport, including nucleoporins. These lines of evidence prompted us to develop molecular targeting therapy for ALS by normalization of disrupted intracellular environment due to ADAR2 down-regulation. In this review, we have summarized the work from our group on the cell death cascade in sporadic ALS and discussed a potential therapeutic strategy for ALS.",2019 Jul,Neurosci Res. 2019 Jul;144:4-13. doi: 10.1016/j.neures.2018.06.004.

30945056,ADAR2 mislocalization and widespread RNA editing aberrations in C9orf72-mediated ALS/FTD.,"The hexanucleotide repeat expansion GGGGCC (G(4)C(2))(n) in the C9orf72 gene is the most common genetic abnormality associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Recent findings suggest that dysfunction of nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking could affect the transport of RNA binding proteins in C9orf72 ALS/FTD. Here, we provide evidence that the RNA editing enzyme adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 2 (ADAR2) is mislocalized in C9orf72 repeat expansion mediated ALS/FTD. ADAR2 is responsible for adenosine (A) to inosine (I) editing of double-stranded RNA, and its function has been shown to be essential for survival. Here we show the mislocalization of ADAR2 in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived motor neurons (hiPSC-MNs) from C9orf72 patients, in mice expressing (G(4)C(2))(149), and in C9orf72 ALS/FTD patient postmortem tissue. As a consequence of this mislocalization we observe alterations in RNA editing in our model systems and across multiple brain regions. Analysis of editing at 408,580 known RNA editing sites indicates that there are vast RNA A to I editing aberrations in C9orf72-mediated ALS/FTD. These RNA editing aberrations are found in many cellular pathways, such as the ALS pathway and the crucial EIF2 signaling pathway. Our findings suggest that the mislocalization of ADAR2 in C9orf72 mediated ALS/FTD is responsible for the alteration of RNA processing events that may impact vast cellular functions, including the integrated stress response (ISR) and protein translation.",2019 Jul,Acta Neuropathol. 2019 Jul;138(1):49-65. doi: 10.1007/s00401-019-01999-w.

31033705,Defining the functions of adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing through hematology.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The direct modification of RNA is now understood to be widespread, evolutionarily conserved and of consequence to cellular and organismal homeostasis. adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing is one of the most common mammalian RNA modifications. Transcriptome-wide maps of the A-to-I editing exist, yet functions for the majority of editing sites remain opaque. Herein we discuss how hematology has been applied to determine physiological and malignant functions of A-to-I editing. RECENT FINDINGS: Functional studies have established that A-to-I editing and ADAR1, responsible for the majority of editing in blood cells, are essential for normal blood cell homeostasis. ADAR1 edits endogenous RNA and reshapes its secondary structure, preventing MDA5 from perceiving the cells own RNA as pathogenic. Roles for ADAR1 in human leukaemia, and most recently, cancer cell intrinsic and extrinsic functions of ADAR1 have been identified that highlight ADAR1 as a therapeutic target in cancer. SUMMARY: The studies reviewed have identified the key physiological function of ADAR1 and mechanistic basis for A-to-I editing in normal physiology and have now been extended to cancer. As our understanding of the biology and consequences of A-to-I editing evolve, it may be possible to target ADAR1 function advantageously in a number of settings.",2019 Jul,Curr Opin Hematol. 2019 Jul;26(4):241-248. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000514.,"['Heraud-Farlow JE', 'Chalk AM', 'Walkley CR']",True
30692772,Recurrent Encephalopathy with Spinal Cord Involvement: An Atypical Manifestation of Aicardi-Goutières Syndrome.,"Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS) is a rare, genetic inflammatory disease due to mutations in any of the seven genes discovered to date (TREX1, RNASEH2A, RNASEH2B, RNASEH2C, SAMHD1, ADAR, and IFIH1). Clinical onset is seen most commonly in utero or in infancy; irritability, feeding difficulties, jitteriness, microcephaly, abnormal movements, seizures, bone marrow suppression, and liver dysfunction are seen either during the neonatal age group or within the first few months of life with abrupt onset of neurologic regression and slowing of head growth. Diffusely abnormal white matters with swelling of frontal or temporal lobes, cerebral atrophy, and intracranial calcification are typical neuroradiologic abnormalities. However, ADAR mutation, a recently discovered AGS gene, can cause late-onset acute or subacute onset of severe dystonia and features of bilateral striatal necrosis on neuroimaging, in the absence of other typical features of AGS. We report a detailed description of a 5-year-old boy who had a recurrent encephalopathic presentation in the setting of infection. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain revealed prominent and fairly symmetrical signal abnormalities in the cerebellar peduncles, thalamus, midbrain, and pons. His throat swab was positive for influenza B, and he was initially diagnosed with influenza encephalopathy. He had a recurrence after 18 months of his initial presentation, and his brain MRI showed extensive areas of signal abnormality similar to, but more extensive than, his previous scan. Extensive spinal cord swelling was also seen. His chronic skin finding was recognized as dyschromatosis symmetrica hereditaria (DSH), and genetic testing revealed compound heterozygous mutations of ADAR gene - causative for AGS. This is the first presentation of recurrent acute encephalopathy in the setting of documented ADAR mutation with the longest interval documented between two acute presentations. This is also the first documentation of extensive spinal cord involvement, which will expand its phenotype. This case also highlights the importance of early identification of DSH, a subtle but characteristic skin lesion of ADAR mutations, for prompt diagnosis of this rare condition.",2019 Jan-Mar,Ann Indian Acad Neurol. 2019 Jan-Mar;22(1):111-115. doi: 10.4103/aian.AIAN_12_18.,"['Samanta D', 'Ramakrishnaiah R']",False

DSH patients display a mixture of hyperpigmented and hypopigmented macules on the dorsal aspects of the extremities, and freckle-like macules on the face. AIMS: To provide new evidence for further study of the etiopathogenisis of DSH. METHODS: Genomic DNA was extracted and used as a template for the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of all 15 coding exons as well as intron-exon boundaries of ADAR1. The PCR products were sequenced directly. RESULTS: We identified eight mutations of ADAR1 in four Chinese pedigrees and four individual patients, which were c.2722G>T, p.(Asp908Tyr), c.1657delA, p.(Ser553fs), c.2563_2564delCT, p.(Leu855fs), c.526T>G, p.(Leu176Val) as well as four previously reported mutations c. 3363_3364insT, p.(Lys1122fs), c. 2865_2866delGT, p.(Val955fs), c.1630C>T, p.(Arg544X), and c.2894C>T, p.(Pro965Leu). In silico analysis predicted that all the mutations reported were pathogenic. LIMITATIONS: We did not study how ADAR1 played its role in DSH.

30669342,ADAR1p150 Forms a Complex with Dicer to Promote miRNA-222 Activity and Regulate PTEN Expression in CVB3-Induced Viral Myocarditis.,"Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADAR) are enzymes that regulate RNA metabolism through post-transcriptional mechanisms. ADAR1 is involved in a variety of pathological conditions including inflammation, cancer, and the host defense against viral infections. However, the role of ADAR1p150 in vascular disease remains unclear. In this study, we examined the expression of ADAR1p150 and its role in viral myocarditis (VMC) in a mouse model. VMC mouse cardiomyocytes showed significantly higher expression of ADAR1p150 compared to the control samples. Coimmunoprecipitation verified that ADAR1p150 forms a complex with Dicer in VMC. miRNA-222, which is involved in many cardiac diseases, is highly expressed in cardiomyocytes in VMC. In addition, the expression of miRNA-222 was promoted by ADAR1p150/Dicer. Among the target genes of miRNA-222, the expression of phosphatase-and-tensin (PTEN) protein was significantly reduced in VMC. By using a bioinformatics tool, we found a potential binding site of miRNA-222 on the PTEN gene's 3'-UTR, suggesting that miRNA-222 might play a regulatory role. In cultured cells, miR-222 suppressed PTEN expression. Our findings suggest that ADAR1p150 plays a key role in complexing with Dicer and promoting the expression of miRNA-222, the latter of which suppresses the expression of the target gene PTEN during VMC. Our work reveals a previously unknown role of ADAR1p150 in gene expression in VMC.",2019 Jan 18,Int J Mol Sci. 2019 Jan 18;20(2):407. doi: 10.3390/ijms20020407.,"['Zhang X', 'Gao X', 'Hu J', 'Xie Y', 'Zuo Y', 'Xu H', 'Zhu S']",True

Here we show that ADAR1-induced hyper-editing in normal human hematopoietic progenitors impairs miR-26a maturation, which represses CDKN1A expression indirectly via EZH2, thereby accelerating cell-cycle transit. However, in blast crisis chronic myeloid leukemia progenitors, loss of EZH2 expression and increased CDKN1A oppose cell-cycle transit. Moreover, A-to-I editing of both the MDM2 regulatory microRNA and its binding site within the 3' UTR region stabilizes MDM2 transcripts, thereby enhancing blast crisis progenitor propagation.

30462291,Inosine induces context-dependent recoding and translational stalling.,"RNA modifications are present in all classes of RNAs. They control the fate of mRNAs by affecting their processing, translation, or stability. Inosine is a particularly widespread modification in metazoan mRNA arising from deamination of adenosine catalyzed by the RNA-targeting adenosine deaminases ADAR1 or ADAR2. Inosine is commonly thought to be interpreted as guanosine by cellular machines and during translation. Here, we systematically test ribosomal decoding using mass spectrometry. We show that while inosine is primarily interpreted as guanosine it can also be decoded as adenosine, and rarely even as uracil. Decoding of inosine as adenosine and uracil is context-dependent. In addition, mass spectrometry analysis indicates that inosine causes ribosome stalling especially when multiple inosines are present in the codon. Indeed, ribosome profiling data from human tissues confirm inosine-dependent ribosome stalling in vivo. To our knowledge this is the first study where decoding of inosine is tested in a comprehensive and unbiased way. Thus, our study shows novel, unanticipated functions for inosines in mRNAs, further expanding coding potential and affecting translational efficiency.",2019 Jan 10,Nucleic Acids Res. 2019 Jan 10;47(1):3-14. doi: 10.1093/nar/gky1163.,"['Licht K', 'Hartl M', 'Amman F', 'Anrather D', 'Janisiw MP', 'Jantsch MF']",True

Although editing of mRNAs catalyzed by adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism in metazoans, organisms outside the animal kingdom lacking ADAR orthologs were thought to lack A-to-I mRNA editing. However, recent discoveries of genome-wide A-to-I mRNA editing during the sexual stage of the wheat scab fungus Fusarium graminearum, model filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa, Sordaria macrospora, and an early diverging filamentous ascomycete Pyronema confluens indicated that A-to-I mRNA editing is likely an evolutionarily conserved feature in filamentous ascomycetes. More importantly, A-to-I mRNA editing has been demonstrated to play crucial roles in different sexual developmental processes and display distinct tissue- or development-specific regulation. Contrary to that in animals, the majority of fungal RNA editing events are non-synonymous editing, which were shown to be generally advantageous and favored by positive selection.

30559380,Loss of ADAR1 in tumours overcomes resistance to immune checkpoint blockade.,"Most patients with cancer either do not respond to immune checkpoint blockade or develop resistance to it, often because of acquired mutations that impair antigen presentation. Here we show that loss of function of the RNA-editing enzyme ADAR1 in tumour cells profoundly sensitizes tumours to immunotherapy and overcomes resistance to checkpoint blockade. In the absence of ADAR1, A-to-I editing of interferon-inducible RNA species is reduced, leading to double-stranded RNA ligand sensing by PKR and MDA5; this results in growth inhibition and tumour inflammation, respectively. Loss of ADAR1 overcomes resistance to PD-1 checkpoint blockade caused by inactivation of antigen presentation by tumour cells. Thus, effective anti-tumour immunity is constrained by inhibitory checkpoints such as ADAR1 that limit the sensing of innate ligands. The induction of sufficient inflammation in tumours that are sensitized to interferon can bypass the therapeutic requirement for CD8(+) T cell recognition of cancer cells and may provide a general strategy to overcome immunotherapy resistance.",2019 Jan,Nature. 2019 Jan;565(7737):43-48. doi: 10.1038/s41586-018-0768-9.

30559422,Tumor-derived IFN triggers chronic pathway agonism and sensitivity to ADAR loss.,"Interferons (IFNs) are cytokines that play a critical role in limiting infectious and malignant diseases (1-4) . Emerging data suggest that the strength and duration of IFN signaling can differentially impact cancer therapies, including immune checkpoint blockade (5-7) . Here, we characterize the output of IFN signaling, specifically IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) signatures, in primary tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas. While immune infiltration correlates with the ISG signature in some primary tumors, the existence of ISG signature-positive tumors without evident infiltration of IFN-producing immune cells suggests that cancer cells per se can be a source of IFN production. Consistent with this hypothesis, analysis of patient-derived tumor xenografts propagated in immune-deficient mice shows evidence of ISG-positive tumors that correlates with expression of human type I and III IFNs derived from the cancer cells. Mechanistic studies using cell line models from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia that harbor ISG signatures demonstrate that this is a by-product of a STING-dependent pathway resulting in chronic tumor-derived IFN production. This imposes a transcriptional state on the tumor, poising it to respond to the aberrant accumulation of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) due to increased sensor levels (MDA5, RIG-I and PKR). By interrogating our functional short-hairpin RNA screen dataset across 398 cancer cell lines, we show that this ISG transcriptional state creates a novel genetic vulnerability. ISG signature-positive cancer cells are sensitive to the loss of ADAR, a dsRNA-editing enzyme that is also an ISG. A genome-wide CRISPR genetic suppressor screen reveals that the entire type I IFN pathway and the dsRNA-activated kinase, PKR, are required for the lethality induced by ADAR depletion.

30559470,Widespread RNA editing dysregulation in brains from autistic individuals.,"Transcriptomic analyses of postmortem brains have begun to elucidate molecular abnormalities in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, a crucial pathway involved in synaptic development, RNA editing, has not yet been studied on a genome-wide scale. Here we profiled global patterns of adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing in a large cohort of postmortem brains of people with ASD. We observed a global bias for hypoediting in ASD brains, which was shared across brain regions and involved many synaptic genes. We show that the Fragile X proteins FMRP and FXR1P interact with RNA-editing enzymes (ADAR proteins) and modulate A-to-I editing. Furthermore, we observed convergent patterns of RNA-editing alterations in ASD and Fragile X syndrome, establishing this as a molecular link between these related diseases. Our findings, which are corroborated across multiple data sets, including dup15q (genomic duplication of 15q11.2-13.1) cases associated with intellectual disability, highlight RNA-editing dysregulation in ASD and reveal new mechanisms underlying this disorder.",2019 Jan,Nat Neurosci. 2019 Jan;22(1):25-36. doi: 10.1038/s41593-018-0287-x.

30659150,Illuminating spatial A-to-I RNA editing signatures within the Drosophila brain.,"Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing, catalyzed by ADAR enzymes, is a ubiquitous mechanism that generates transcriptomic diversity. This process is particularly important for proper neuronal function; however, little is known about how RNA editing is dynamically regulated between the many functionally distinct neuronal populations of the brain. Here, we present a spatial RNA editing map in the Drosophila brain and show that different neuronal populations possess distinct RNA editing signatures. After purifying and sequencing RNA from genetically marked groups of neuronal nuclei, we identified a large number of editing sites and compared editing levels in hundreds of transcripts across nine functionally different neuronal populations. We found distinct editing repertoires for each population, including sites in repeat regions of the transcriptome and differential editing in highly conserved and likely functional regions of transcripts that encode essential neuronal genes. These changes are site-specific and not driven by changes in Adar expression, suggesting a complex, targeted regulation of editing levels in key transcripts. This fine-tuning of the transcriptome between different neurons by RNA editing may account for functional differences between distinct populations in the brain.",2019 Feb 5,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2019 Feb 5;116(6):2318-2327. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1811768116.

30590609,Sensitive ADAR editing reporter in cancer cells enables high-throughput screening of small molecule libraries.,"Adenosine to inosine editing is common in the human transcriptome and changes of this essential activity is associated with disease. Children with ADAR1 mutations develop fatal Aicardi-Goutières syndrome characterized by aberrant interferon expression. In contrast, ADAR1 overexpression is associated with increased malignancy of breast, lung and liver cancer. ADAR1 silencing in breast cancer cells leads to increased apoptosis, suggesting an anti-apoptotic function that promotes cancer progression. Yet, suitable high-throughput editing assays are needed to efficiently screen chemical libraries for modifiers of ADAR1 activity. We describe the development of a bioluminescent reporter system that facilitates rapid and accurate determination of endogenous editing activity. The system is based on the highly sensitive and quantitative Nanoluciferase that is conditionally expressed upon reporter-transcript editing. Stably introduced into cancer cell lines, the system reports on elevated endogenous ADAR1 editing activity induced by interferon as well as knockdown of ADAR1 and ADAR2. In a single-well setup we used the reporter in HeLa cells to screen a small molecule library of 33 000 compounds. This yielded a primary hit rate of 0.9% at 70% inhibition of editing. Thus, we provide a key tool for high-throughput identification of modifiers of A-to-I editing activity in cancer cells.",2019 Feb 28,Nucleic Acids Res. 2019 Feb 28;47(4):e22. doi: 10.1093/nar/gky1228.,"['Fritzell K', 'Xu LD', 'Otrocka M', 'Andréasson C', 'Öhman M']",True

The deep mechanism of HCC metastasis is closely related to the interaction between integrins and extracellular matrix (ECM) in tumor microenvironment. MATERIAL AND METHODS In vitro cell adhesion assay was performed to determine the capability of adhering to ECM elements of HCC cells. To modulate the expression status of ADAR1 p110 in tumor cells, lentivirus system was applied. Meanwhile, patients' HCC samples and orthotopic xenograft mouse model were used for verifying our in vitro data. RESULTS ADAR1 p110 could strongly enhance the adhesion of HCC tumor cells to ECM, which was usually regarded as the initiation of tumor invasion. Such phenotype was caused due to up-regulation of ITGA2 both in mRNA and protein level. Moreover, specimen collected from HCC patients revealed a positive correlation between ADAR1 and ITGA2. Finally, ADAR1 p110 promoted HCC metastasis was verified when we applied orthotopic xenograft mouse model. CONCLUSIONS ADAR1 could enhance HCC metastasis by promoting tumor cells adhering to ECM via increasing ITGA2 expression. This phenomenon could provide novel information to better understanding the mechanism of HCC metastasis procedure.",2019 Feb 24,Med Sci Monit. 2019 Feb 24;25:1469-1479. doi: 10.12659/MSM.911944.,"['Yu J', 'Zhang C', 'Yu Q', 'Yu H', 'Zhang B']",True
30581135,A Bump-Hole Approach for Directed RNA Editing.,"Molecules capable of directing changes to nucleic acid sequences are powerful tools for molecular biology and promising candidates for the therapeutic correction of disease-causing mutations. However, unwanted reactions at off-target sites complicate their use. Here we report selective combinations of mutant editing enzyme and directing oligonucleotide. Mutations in human ADAR2 (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 2) that introduce aromatic amino acids at position 488 reduce background RNA editing. This residue is juxtaposed to the nucleobase that pairs with the editing site adenine, suggesting a steric clash for the bulky mutants. Replacing this nucleobase with a hydrogen atom removes the clash and restores editing activity. A crystal structure of the E488Y mutant bound to abasic site-containing RNA shows the accommodation of the tyrosine side chain.

30592616,NMR Dynamics Study Reveals the Zα Domain of Human ADAR1 Associates with and Dissociates from Z-RNA More Slowly than Z-DNA.,"Human RNA editing enzyme ADAR1 deaminates adenosine in pre-mRNA to yield inosine. The Zα domain of human ADAR1 (hZα(ADAR1)) binds specifically to left-handed Z-RNA as well as Z-DNA and stabilizes the Z-conformation. To answer the question of how hZα(ADAR1) can induce both the B-Z transition of DNA and the A-Z transition of RNA, we investigated the structure and dynamics of hZα(ADAR1) in complex with 6-base-pair Z-DNA or Z-RNA. We performed chemical shift perturbation and relaxation dispersion experiments on hZα(ADAR1) upon binding to Z-DNA as well as Z-RNA. Our study demonstrates the unique dynamics of hZα(ADAR1) during the A-Z transition of RNA, in which the hZα(ADAR1) protein forms a thermodynamically stable complex with Z-RNA, similar to Z-DNA, but kinetically converts RNA to the Z-form more slowly than DNA. We also discovered some distinct structural features of hZα(ADAR1) in the Z-RNA binding conformation. Our results suggest that the A-Z transition of RNA facilitated by hZα(ADAR1) displays unique structural and dynamic features that may be involved in targeting ADAR1 for a role in recognition of RNA substrates.",2019 Feb 15,ACS Chem Biol. 2019 Feb 15;14(2):245-255. doi: 10.1021/acschembio.8b00914.

However, the role of ADAR1 in dendritic cells (DC), representing critical professional APCs, is unknown. We have established conditional murine CD11c Cre-mediated ADAR1 gene ablation, which did not induce general apoptosis in CD11c(+) cells but instead manifests in cell type-specific effects in DC subpopulations. Bone marrow-derived DC subset analysis revealed an incapacity to differentiate CD103 DC(+) in both bulk bone marrow and purified pre-DC lineage progenitor assays. ADAR1 deficiency further resulted in a preferential systemic loss of CD8(+)/CD103(+) DCs, revealing critical dependency on ADAR1, whereas other DC subpopulations were moderately affected or unaffected. Additionally, alveolar macrophages were depleted and dysfunctional, resembling pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. These results reveal an unrecognized role of ADAR1 in DC subset homeostasis and unveils the cell type-specific effects of RNA editing.",2019 Feb 15,J Immunol. 2019 Feb 15;202(4):1099-1111. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1800269.

30760294,Dynamic inosinome profiles reveal novel patient stratification and gender-specific differences in glioblastoma.,"BACKGROUND: Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing is an essential post-transcriptional mechanism mediated by ADAR enzymes that have been recently associated with cancer. RESULTS: Here, we characterize the inosinome signature in normal brain and de novo glioblastoma (GBM) using new metrics that re-stratify GBM patients according to their editing profiles and indicate this post-transcriptional event as a possible molecular mechanism for sexual dimorphism in GBM. We find that over 85% of de novo GBMs carry a deletion involving the genomic locus of ADAR3, which is specifically expressed in the brain. By analyzing RNA editing and patient outcomes, an intriguing gender-dependent link appears, with high editing of Alus shown to be beneficial only in male patients. We propose an inosinome-based molecular stratification of GBM patients that identifies two different GBM subgroups, INO-1 and INO-2, which can identify novel high-risk gender-specific patient groups for which more aggressive treatments may be necessary. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide a detailed picture of RNA editing landscape in normal brain and GBM, exploring A-to-I RNA editing regulation, disclosing unexpected editing implications for GBM patient stratification and identification of gender-dependent high-risk patients, and suggesting COG3 I/V as an eligible site for future personalized targeted gene therapy.",2019 Feb 13,Genome Biol. 2019 Feb 13;20(1):33. doi: 10.1186/s13059-019-1647-x.,"['Silvestris DA', 'Picardi E', 'Cesarini V', 'Fosso B', 'Mangraviti N', 'Massimi L', 'Martini M', 'Pesole G', 'Locatelli F', 'Gallo A']",True

An integrated analysis of m⁶A-RIP (RNA immunoprecipitation) and total RNA-Seq of METTL3-silenced GSCs identified that m⁶A modification in GSCs is principally carried out by METTL3. The m⁶A-modified transcripts showed higher abundance compared to non-modified transcripts. Further, we showed that the METTL3 is essential for the expression of GSC-specific actively transcribed genes. Silencing METTL3 resulted in the elevation of several aberrant alternative splicing events. We also found that putative m⁶A reader proteins play a key role in the RNA stabilization function of METTL3. METTL3 altered A-to-I and C-to-U RNA editing events by differentially regulating RNA editing enzymes ADAR and APOBEC3A. Similar to protein-coding genes, lincRNAs (long intergenic non-coding RNAs) with m⁶A marks showed METTL3-dependent high expression. m⁶A modification of 3'UTRs appeared to result in a conformation-dependent hindrance to miRNA binding to their targets. The integrated analysis of the m⁶A regulome in METTL3-silenced GSCs showed global disruption in tumorigenic pathways that are indispensable for GSC maintenance and glioma progression. We conclude that METTL3 plays a vital role in many steps of RNA processing and orchestrates successful execution of oncogenic pathways in GSCs.",2019 Feb 13,Genes (Basel). 2019 Feb 13;10(2):141. doi: 10.3390/genes10020141.,"['Visvanathan A', 'Patil V', 'Abdulla S', 'Hoheisel JD', 'Somasundaram K']",False

Among the many discoveries in biological chemistry during this period was the identification of RNA modification by C6 deamination of adenosine (A) to produce inosine (I) in double-stranded (ds) RNA. This posttranscriptional RNA modification by adenosine deamination, known as A-to-I RNA editing, diversifies the transcriptome and modulates the innate immune interferon response. A-to-I editing is catalyzed by a family of enzymes, adenosine deaminases acting on dsRNA (ADARs). The roles of A-to-I editing are varied and include effects on mRNA translation, pre-mRNA splicing, and micro-RNA silencing. Suppression of dsRNA-triggered induction and action of interferon, the cornerstone of innate immunity, has emerged as a key function of ADAR1 editing of self (cellular) and nonself (viral) dsRNAs. A-to-I modification of RNA is essential for the normal regulation of cellular processes.

30489667,Overexpression of ADAR1 into the cytoplasm correlates with a better prognosis of patients with oral squamous cells carcinoma.,"BACKGROUND: ADAR1 is an enzymatic protein, which catalyzes a RNA editing reaction by converting Adenosine to Inosine, and its expression has been found to be dysregulated in many cancer types. The aim of this study was to analyze the expression of ADAR1 in oral squamous cells carcinoma. METHODS: In order to analyze the ADAR1 mRNA expression, data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were downloaded and analyzed. In addition, immunohistochemistry analysis was performed on an institutional database including 46 samples of oral squamous cell carcinoma in a tissue microarray (TMA). RESULTS: No statistically significant correlation linked the mRNA ADAR1 expression to any clinic-pathological variables in the TCGA database. Immunohistochemistry analysis of ADAR1 showed different expressions between normal mucosa and tumor tissue. Focusing on the subcellular localization, the nuclear expression of ADAR1 correlated with higher grading of differentiation (ρ = 0.442; P-value = 0.002); the general expression of ADAR1 either in cytoplasm or in nuclei, correlated with the Gender of patients (Cytoplasm expression: ρ = -0.295; P-value = 0.049; while for nuclear expression: ρ = +0.374; P = 0.011); cytosol expression resulted to be an independent protective prognostic factor (HR = 0.047; C.I. 95% 0.007-0.321; P-value = 0.002).

30692041,Dyschromatosis symmetrica hereditaria and reticulate acropigmentation of Kitamura: An update.,"Dyschromatosis symmetrica hereditaria (DSH) and reticulate acropigmentation of Kitamura (RAK) are rare, inherited pigmentary diseases. DSH shows a mixture of pigmented and depigmented macules on the extremities. RAK shows reticulated, slightly depressed pigmented macules on the extremities. The causative gene of DSH was clarified as ADAR1 by positional cloning including linkage analysis and haplotype analysis in 2003. Ten years later, the causative gene of RAK was identified as ADAM10 by whole-exome sequencing, in 2013. ADAR1 is an RNA-editing enzyme which catalyzes the deamination of adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) in double-stranded RNA substrates during post-transcription processing. Inosine acts as guanine during translation, resulting in codon alterations or alternative splice sites that lead to functional changes in proteins when they occur in coding regions. In 2012, it was clarified that ADAR1 mutations cause Aicardi-Goutières syndrome 6, which is a severe genetic inflammatory disease that affects the brain and the skin. A zinc metalloprotease, a disintegrin and metalloprotease domain-containing protein 10 (ADAM10), is involved in the ectodomain shedding of various membrane proteins and shows various functions in vivo. ADAM10 is known to be involved in the ectodomain shedding of Notch proteins as substrates in the skin. We speculate that the pathogenesis of RAK and Dowling-Degos disease (DDD, a pigmentary disease similar to RAK) is associated with the Notch signaling pathway.

Here we describe the engineering of chemically optimized antisense oligonucleotides that recruit endogenous human ADARs to edit endogenous transcripts in a simple and programmable way, an approach we call RESTORE (recruiting endogenous ADAR to specific transcripts for oligonucleotide-mediated RNA editing). We observed almost no off-target editing, and natural editing homeostasis was not perturbed. We successfully applied RESTORE to a panel of standard human cell lines and human primary cells and demonstrated repair of the clinically relevant PiZZ mutation, which causes α1-antitrypsin deficiency, and editing of phosphotyrosine 701 in STAT1, the activity switch of the signaling factor.

31815657,The majority of A-to-I RNA editing is not required for mammalian homeostasis.,"BACKGROUND: Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing, mediated by ADAR1 and ADAR2, occurs at tens of thousands to millions of sites across mammalian transcriptomes. A-to-I editing can change the protein coding potential of a transcript and alter RNA splicing, miRNA biology, RNA secondary structure and formation of other RNA species. In vivo, the editing-dependent protein recoding of GRIA2 is the essential function of ADAR2, while ADAR1 editing prevents innate immune sensing of endogenous RNAs by MDA5 in both human and mouse. However, a significant proportion of A-to-I editing sites can be edited by both ADAR1 and ADAR2, particularly within the brain where both are highly expressed. The physiological function(s) of these shared sites, including those evolutionarily conserved, is largely unknown. RESULTS: To generate completely A-to-I editing-deficient mammals, we crossed the viable rescued ADAR1-editing-deficient animals (Adar1(E861A/E861A)Ifih1(-/-)) with rescued ADAR2-deficient (Adarb1(-/-)Gria2(R/R)) animals. Unexpectedly, the global absence of editing was well tolerated. Adar1(E861A/E861A)Ifih1(-/-)Adarb1(-/-)Gria2(R/R) were recovered at Mendelian ratios and age normally. Detailed transcriptome analysis demonstrated that editing was absent in the brains of the compound mutants and that ADAR1 and ADAR2 have similar editing site preferences and patterns. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that ADAR1 and ADAR2 are non-redundant and do not compensate for each other's essential functions in vivo. Physiologically essential A-to-I editing comprises a small subset of the editome, and the majority of editing is dispensable for mammalian homeostasis. Moreover, in vivo biologically essential protein recoding mediated by A-to-I editing is an exception in mammals.",2019 Dec 9,Genome Biol. 2019 Dec 9;20(1):268. doi: 10.1186/s13059-019-1873-2.,"['Chalk AM', 'Taylor S', 'Heraud-Farlow JE', 'Walkley CR']",True
31801951,Cell death following the loss of ADAR1 mediated A-to-I RNA editing is not effected by the intrinsic apoptosis pathway.,"Modifications of RNA, collectively termed as the epitranscriptome, are widespread, evolutionarily conserved and contribute to gene regulation and protein diversity in healthy and disease states. There are >160 RNA modifications described, greatly exceeding the number of modifications to DNA. Of these, adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing is one of the most common. There are tens of thousands of A-to-I editing sites in mouse, and millions in humans. Upon translation or sequencing an inosine base is decoded as guanosine, leading to A-to-G mismatches between the RNA and DNA. Inosine has different base pairing properties to adenosine and as a result editing not only alters the RNA code but can also change the RNA structure. In mammals A-to-I editing is performed by ADAR1 and ADAR2. A feature of murine loss of function ADAR1 alleles is cell death and a failure to survive embryogenesis. Adar1(-/-) and editing deficient (Adar1(E861A/E861A)) mice die between E11.75-13.5 of failed hematopoiesis. Strikingly this phenotype is rescued by the deletion of the cytosolic dsRNA sensor MDA5 or its downstream adaptor MAVS, a mechanism conserved in human and mouse. Current literature indicates that the loss of ADAR1 leads to cell death via apoptosis, yet this has not been genetically established. We report that blockade of the intrinsic (mitochondrial) apoptosis pathway, through the loss of both BAK and BAX, does not rescue or modify the cellular phenotype of the fetal liver or extend the lifespan of ADAR1 editing deficient embryos. We had anticipated that the loss of BAK and BAX would rescue, or at least significantly extend, the gestational viability of Adar1(E861A/E861A) embryos. However, the triple mutant Adar1(E861A/E861A) Bak(-/-) Bax(-/-) embryos that were recovered at E13.5 were indistinguishable from the Adar1(E861A/E861A) embryos with BAK and BAX.

A-to-I editing by ADAR1 has been reported to regulate innate immunity in response to viral infections. Here, we evaluated the role of ADAR1 in HPV infection in vitro and in vivo. Innate immune activation was characterized in human keratinocyte cell lines constitutively infected or not with HPV. ADAR1 knockdown induced an innate immune response through enhanced expression of RIG-I-like receptors (RLR) signaling cascade, over-production of type-I IFNs and pro-inflammatory cytokines. ADAR1 knockdown enhanced expression of HPV proteins, a process dependent on innate immune function as no A-to-I editing could be identified in HPV transcripts. A genetic association study was performed in a cohort of HPV/HIV infected individuals followed for a median of 6 years (range 0.1-24). We identified the low frequency haplotype AACCAT significantly associated with recurrent HPV dysplasia, suggesting a role of ADAR1 in the outcome of HPV infection in HIV+ individuals. In summary, our results suggest that ADAR1-mediated innate immune activation may influence HPV disease outcome, therefore indicating that modification of innate immune effectors regulated by ADAR1 could be a therapeutic strategy against HPV infection.",2019 Dec 27,Sci Rep. 2019 Dec 27;9(1):19848. doi: 10.1038/s41598-019-56422-x.,"['Pujantell M', 'Badia R', 'Galván-Femenía I', 'Garcia-Vidal E', 'de Cid R', 'Alcalde C', 'Tarrats A', 'Piñol M', 'Garcia F', 'Chamorro AM', 'Revollo B', 'Videla S', 'Parés D', 'Corral J', 'Tural C', 'Sirera G', 'Esté JA', 'Ballana E', 'Riveira-Muñoz E']",False

However, the functional impact of RNA editing of miRNAs in cancer remains largely unexplored. Here, we focused on an ADAR2-catalyzed RNA editing site within the miR-379-5p seed region. This site was under-edited in tumors relative to normal tissues, with a high editing level being correlated with better patient survival times across cancer types. We demonstrated that in contrast to wild-type miRNA, edited miR-379-5p inhibited cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis in diverse tumor contexts in vitro, which was due to the ability of edited but not wild-type miR-379-5p to target CD97. Importantly, through nanoliposomal delivery, edited miR-379-5p mimics significantly inhibited tumor growth and extended survival of mice.

31630170,DUX4-induced bidirectional HSATII satellite repeat transcripts form intranuclear double-stranded RNA foci in human cell models of FSHD.,"The DUX4 transcription factor is normally expressed in the cleavage-stage embryo and regulates genes involved in embryonic genome activation. Misexpression of DUX4 in skeletal muscle, however, is toxic and causes facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD). We recently showed DUX4-induced toxicity is due, in part, to the activation of the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) response pathway and the accumulation of intranuclear dsRNA foci. Here, we determined the composition of DUX4-induced dsRNAs. We found that a subset of DUX4-induced dsRNAs originate from inverted Alu repeats embedded within the introns of DUX4-induced transcripts and from DUX4-induced dsRNA-forming intergenic transcripts enriched for endogenous retroviruses, Alu and LINE-1 elements. However, these repeat classes were also represented in dsRNAs from cells not expressing DUX4. In contrast, pericentric human satellite II (HSATII) repeats formed a class of dsRNA specific to the DUX4 expressing cells. Further investigation revealed that DUX4 can initiate the bidirectional transcription of normally heterochromatin-silenced HSATII repeats. DUX4-induced HSATII RNAs co-localized with DUX4-induced nuclear dsRNA foci and with intranuclear aggregation of EIF4A3 and ADAR1. Finally, gapmer-mediated knockdown of HSATII transcripts depleted DUX4-induced intranuclear ribonucleoprotein aggregates and decreased DUX4-induced cell death, suggesting that HSATII-formed dsRNAs contribute to DUX4 toxicity.",2019 Dec 1,Hum Mol Genet. 2019 Dec 1;28(23):3997-4011. doi: 10.1093/hmg/ddz242.,"['Shadle SC', 'Bennett SR', 'Wong CJ', 'Karreman NA', 'Campbell AE', 'van der Maarel SM', 'Bass BL', 'Tapscott SJ']",True
31332697,RNA editing blood biomarkers for predicting mood alterations in HCV patients.,"Treatment-emergent depression is a common complication in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection undergoing antiviral combination therapy with IFN-α and ribavirin. It has recently been shown that changes in A-to-I RNA editing rates are associated with various pathologies such as inflammatory disorders, depression and suicide. Interestingly, IFN-α induces gene expression of the RNA editing enzyme ADAR1-1 (ADAR1a-p150) and alters overall RNA editing activity. In this study, we took advantage of the high prevalence of pharmacologically induced depression in patients treated with IFN-α and ribavirin to test the interest of RNA editing-related biomarkers in white blood cells of patients. In this 16-week longitudinal study, a small cohort of patients was clinically evaluated using standard assessment methods prior to and during antiviral therapy and blood samples were collected to analyse RNA editing modifications. A-I RNA editing activity on the phosphodiesterase 8A (PDE8A) gene, a previously identified RNA editing hotspot in the context of lupus erythematosus, was quantified by using an ultra-deep next-generation sequencing approach. We also monitored gene expression levels of the ADAR enzymes and the PDE8A gene during treatment by qPCR. As expected, psychiatric evaluation could track treatment-emergent depression, which occurred in 30% of HCV patients. We show that PDE8A RNA editing is increased in all patients following interferon treatment, but differently in 30% of patients. This effect was mimicked in a cellular model using SHSY-5Y neuroblastoma cells. By combining the data of A-I RNA editing and gene expression, we generated an algorithm that allowed discrimination between the group of patients who developed a treatment-emergent depression and those who did not. The current model of drug-induced depression identified A-I RNA editing biomarkers as useful tools for the identification of individuals at risk of developing depression in an objective, quantifiable biological blood test.",2019 Dec,J Neurovirol. 2019 Dec;25(6):825-836. doi: 10.1007/s13365-019-00772-9.

Altered editing has severe consequences for human health and can cause interferonopathies, neurological disorders, and cardiovascular disease, as well as impacting on cancer progression. ADAR1-mediated RNA editing plays an important role in antiviral immunity and is essential for distinguishing between endogenous and viral RNA, thereby preventing autoimmune disorders.

31413531,LncRNA MEG3 acts a biomarker and regulates cell functions by targeting ADAR1 in colorectal cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most prevalent malignancy and has the fourth highest global cancer mortality rate. Early diagnosis and prompt medical attention can improve quality of life and the prognosis of CRC patients. Accumulating evidence reveals that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) function as oncogenes or anti-oncogenes, as well as biomarkers in various cancers. AIM: To investigate the levels and molecular mechanism of the lncRNA maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) in CRC. METHODS: The levels of lncRNA MEG3 in CRC tissue, serum and cell line samples were explored via qRT-PCR. The relationship between MEG3 levels and clinicopathological features in CRC was investigated. The diagnostic and prognostic values of serum MEG3 levels were analyzed with ROC curves and Kaplan‑Meier survival curves, respectively. RESULTS: Significant decreased levels of MEG3 existed in CRC tissue, cell lines and serum. CRC patients with down-regulated serum MEG3 levels had larger tumor sizes, and advanced clinical stages. The sensitivity and specificity of serum MEG3 levels in CRC detection was 0.667 and 0.875, respectively. Tumor size, T stages, and serum MEG3 levels are indie factors that produce an effect on CRC patients' prognosis. Kaplan‑Meier survival curves suggested that CRC patients with high levels of MEG3 had a remarkably better overall survival rate. CONCLUSION: LncRNA MEG3 is down-regulated in CRC, and regulates cell functions by targeting adenosine deaminase's effect on RNA 1 in CRC.",2019 Aug 7,World J Gastroenterol. 2019 Aug 7;25(29):3972-3984. doi: 10.3748/wjg.v25.i29.3972.,"['Wang W', 'Xie Y', 'Chen F', 'Liu X', 'Zhong LL', 'Wang HQ', 'Li QC']",True
31095429,AKT-dependent phosphorylation of the adenosine deaminases ADAR-1 and -2 inhibits deaminase activity.,"Murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog (AKT) kinases target both cytosolic and nuclear substrates for phosphorylation. Whereas the cytosolic substrates are known to be closely associated with the regulation of apoptosis and autophagy or metabolism and protein synthesis, the nuclear substrates are, for the most part, poorly understood. To better define the role of nuclear AKT, potential AKT substrates were isolated from the nuclear lysates of leukemic cell lines using a phosphorylated AKT substrate antibody and identified in tandem mass spectrometry. Among the proteins identified was adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR)1p110, the predominant nuclear isoform of the adenosine deaminase acting on double-stranded RNA. Coimmunoprecipitation studies and in vitro kinase assays revealed that AKT-1, -2, and -3 interact with both ADAR1p110 and ADAR2 and phosphorylate these RNA editases. Using site-directed mutagenesis of suspected AKT phosphorylation sites, AKT was found to primarily phosphorylate ADAR1p110 and ADAR2 on T738 and T553, respectively, and overexpression of the phosphomimic mutants ADAR1p110 (T738D) and ADAR2 (T553D) resulted in a 50-100% reduction in editase activity.

31522671,RNA Editing by ADAR Adenosine Deaminases: From Molecular Plasticity of Neural Proteins to the Mechanisms of Human Cancer.,"RNA editing by adenosine deaminases of the ADAR family attracts a growing interest of researchers, both zoologists studying ecological and evolutionary plasticity of invertebrates and medical biochemists focusing on the mechanisms of cancer and other human diseases. These enzymes deaminate adenosine residues in the double-stranded (ds) regions of RNA with the formation of inosine. As a result, some RNAs change their three-dimensional structure and functions. Adenosine-to-inosine editing in the mRNA coding sequences may cause amino acid substitutions in the encoded proteins. Here, we reviewed current concepts on the functions of two active ADAR isoforms identified in mammals (including humans). The ADAR1 protein, which acts non-specifically on extended dsRNA regions, is capable of immunosuppression via inactivation of the dsRNA interactions with specific sensors inducing the cell immunity. Expression of a specific ADAR1 splicing variant is regulated by the type I interferons by the negative feedback mechanism. It was shown that immunosuppressing effects of ADAR1 facilitate progression of some types of cancer. On the other hand, changes in the amino acid sequences resulting from the mRNA editing by the ADAR enzymes can result in the formation of neoantigens that can activate the antitumor immunity. The ADAR2 isoform acts on RNA more selectively; its function is associated with the editing of mRNA coding regions and can lead to the amino acid substitutions, in particular, those essential for the proper functioning of some neurotransmitter receptors in the central nervous system.",2019 Aug,Biochemistry (Mosc). 2019 Aug;84(8):896-904. doi: 10.1134/S0006297919080054.,"['Goncharov AO', 'Kliuchnikova AA', 'Nasaev SS', 'Moshkovskii SA']",True

We identify 1.15 million unique genomic sites, and 164 recoding sites residing in 100 protein coding genes, including ion channels, transporters, and receptors predicted to affect brain function and behavior. Some edited sites are similarly edited in other insects, cephalopods and even mammals. The global editing level of protein coding and non-coding transcripts weakly correlates with task performance (brood care vs. foraging), but not affected by dominance rank or juvenile hormone known to influence physiology and behavior.

31018137,Disruption in A-to-I Editing Levels Affects C. elegans Development More Than a Complete Lack of Editing.,"A-to-I RNA editing, catalyzed by ADAR proteins, is widespread in eukaryotic transcriptomes. Studies showed that, in C. elegans, ADR-2 can actively deaminate dsRNA, whereas ADR-1 cannot. Therefore, we set out to study the effect of each of the ADAR genes on the RNA editing process. We performed comprehensive phenotypic, transcriptomics, proteomics, and RNA binding screens on worms mutated in a single ADAR gene. We found that ADR-1 mutants exhibit more-severe phenotypes than ADR-2, and some of them are a result of non-editing functions of ADR-1. We also show that ADR-1 significantly binds edited genes and regulates mRNA expression, whereas the effect on protein levels is minor. In addition, ADR-1 primarily promotes editing by ADR-2 at the L4 stage of development. Our results suggest that ADR-1 has a significant role in the RNA editing process and in altering editing levels that affect RNA expression; loss of ADR-1 results in severe phenotypes.",2019 Apr 23,Cell Rep. 2019 Apr 23;27(4):1244-1253.e4. doi: 10.1016/j.celrep.2019.03.095.,"['Ganem NS', 'Ben-Asher N', 'Manning AC', 'Deffit SN', 'Washburn MC', 'Wheeler EC', 'Yeo GW', 'Zgayer OB', 'Mantsur E', 'Hundley HA', 'Lamm AT']",True

It remains undefined whether long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) coordinate the metabolic switch in pancreatic cancer. Here we identify a nuclear-enriched antisense lncRNA of glutaminase (GLS-AS) as a critical regulator involved in pancreatic cancer metabolism. GLS-AS was downregulated in pancreatic cancer tissues compared with noncancerous peritumor tissues. Depletion of GLS-AS promoted proliferation and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells both in vitro and in xenograft tumors of nude mice. GLS-AS inhibited GLS expression at the posttranscriptional level via formation of double stranded RNA with GLS pre-mRNA through ADAR/Dicer-dependent RNA interference. GLS-AS expression was transcriptionally downregulated by nutrient stress-induced Myc. Conversely, GLS-AS decreased Myc expression by impairing the GLS-mediated stability of Myc protein. These results imply a reciprocal feedback loop wherein Myc and GLS-AS regulate GLS overexpression during nutrient stress. Ectopic overexpression of GLS-AS inhibited proliferation and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells by repressing the Myc/GLS pathway. Moreover, expression of GLS-AS and GLS was inversely correlated in clinical samples of pancreatic cancer, while low expression of GLS-AS was associated with poor clinical outcomes. Collectively, our study implicates a novel lncRNA-mediated Myc/GLS pathway, which may serve as a metabolic target for pancreatic cancer therapy, and advances our understanding of the coupling role of lncRNA in nutrition stress and tumorigenesis.Significance: These findings show that lncRNA GLS-AS mediates a feedback loop of Myc and GLS, providing a potential therapeutic target for metabolic reprogramming in pancreatic cancer.Graphical Abstract: http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/79/7/1398/F1.large.jpg.See related commentary by Mafra and Dias, p. 1302.",2019 Apr 1,Cancer Res. 2019 Apr 1;79(7):1398-1412. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-18-0419.

30651363,Adenosine Deaminase Acting on RNA 1 Associates with Orf Virus OV20.0 and Enhances Viral Replication.,"Orf virus (ORFV) infects sheep and goats and is also an important zoonotic pathogen. The viral protein OV20.0 has been shown to suppress innate immunity by targeting the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-activated protein kinase (PKR) by multiple mechanisms. These mechanisms include a direct interaction with PKR and binding with two PKR activators, dsRNA and the cellular PKR activator (PACT), which ultimately leads to the inhibition of PKR activation. In the present study, we identified a novel association between OV20.0 and adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1). OV20.0 bound directly to the dsRNA binding domains (RBDs) of ADAR1 in the absence of dsRNA. Additionally, OV20.0 preferentially interacted with RBD1 of ADAR1, which was essential for its dsRNA binding ability and for the homodimerization that is critical for intact adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I)-editing activity. Finally, the association with OV20.0 suppressed the A-to-I-editing ability of ADAR1, while ADAR1 played a proviral role during ORFV infection by inhibiting PKR phosphorylation. These observations revealed a new strategy used by OV20.0 to evade antiviral responses via PKR.IMPORTANCE Viruses evolve specific strategies to counteract host innate immunity. ORFV, an important zoonotic pathogen, encodes OV20.0 to suppress PKR activation via multiple mechanisms, including interactions with PKR and two PKR activators. In this study, we demonstrated that OV20.0 interacts with ADAR1, a cellular enzyme responsible for converting adenosine (A) to inosine (I) in RNA. The RNA binding domains, but not the catalytic domain, of ADAR1 are required for this interaction. The OV20.0-ADAR1 association affects the functions of both proteins; OV20.0 suppressed the A-to-I editing of ADAR1, while ADAR1 elevated OV20.0 expression. The proviral role of ADAR1 is likely due to the inhibition of PKR phosphorylation. As RNA editing by ADAR1 contributes to the stability of the genetic code and the structure of RNA, these observations suggest that in addition to serving as a PKR inhibitor, OV20.0 might modulate ADAR1-dependent gene expression to combat antiviral responses or achieve efficient viral infection.",2019 Apr 1,J Virol. 2019 Mar 21;93(7):e01912-18. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01912-18.

Moench).,"In the last decades, deficiency of macro- and micronutrients was considered as a serious problem associated with the increase in the human population. To meet the increased demand for food consumption, the wild relative plant might serve as an important source of new genetic material for increasing macro- and micronutrients. To investigate this, the variations in protein content, in vitro protein digestibility, tannin content, phytic acid content, total polyphenol content, and total and bioavailability of minerals were studied in grains of ten wild sorghums and two released sorghum cultivars. The results showed significant differences (p ≤ 0.05) in all quality tests among the genotypes. The highest percentage of total protein contents and in vitro protein digestibility were encountered in the grains of PQ-434 (14.6%) and the released cultivar AG8 (49.8%), respectively, while the highest concentrations of total and bioavailable iron were found in the grains of Almahkara (3.17 mg/100 g) and Abusabiba (92.8 mg/100 g), respectively. The grains of wild sorghum genotype Adar Umbatikh grains were found to possess higher total zinc contents. The PCA identified only five components of eigenvalues greater than one and cumulatively accounted for 88% of the total variation.

Here, we analyzed BEP2D (a human bronchial epithelial cell line) and radiation-induced malignantly transformed cell lines with next generation sequencing. By performing an integrated analysis of A-to-I RNA editing, we found that single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) might induce the downregulation of ADAR2 enzymes, and further caused the abnormal occurrence of RNA editing in malignantly transformed cell lines. These editing events were significantly enriched in differentially expressed genes between normal cell line and malignantly transformed cell lines. In addition, oncogenes CTNNB1 and FN1 were highly edited and significantly overexpressed in malignantly transformed cell lines, thus may be responsible for the lung cancer progression.

31572009,ADAR1 may be involved in the proliferation of acute myeloid leukemia cells via regulation of the Wnt pathway.,"PURPOSE: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common type of leukemia and characterized by the malignant growth of leukemic cells. Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) have been shown to participate in the proliferation of cancer cells and progression of various cancers. However, the role of ADAR1 in AML has not been investigated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We compared the expression levels of ADAR1 between samples obtained from different AML patients and controls using quantitative-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. We also investigated the functional role and possible mechanisms via silencing the expression of ADAR1 in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: We found that the mRNA and protein levels of ADAR1 were significantly higher in AML patients. The mRNA expression of ADAR1 was positively correlated with the ratio of leukemic cells. Additionally, silencing of ADAR1 expression significantly suppressed the proliferation of AML cells and induced G0/1 arrest. For the analysis of the mechanism, the quantitative-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting results revealed that ADAR1 knockdown resulted in the decreased expression of Wingless-Int (Wnt) effectors including β-catenin, c-Myc, transcription factor 4, and cyclin D2.

32009879,RNA Editing of Serotonin 2C Receptor and Alcohol Intake.,"Serotonin 2C receptor (5-HT(2) (C)R) belongs to the superfamily of seven transmembrane domain receptors coupled to G proteins (GPCR). It is broadly distributed in the CNS and its expression is relatively high in the limbic system including the amygdala, nucleus accumbens (NAc), hippocampus, and hypothalamus. Based on its expression patterns and numerous pharmacological studies, 5-HT(2) (C)R is thought to be involved in various brain functions including emotion, appetite, and motor behavior. Here, we review 5-HT(2) (C)R and its relationship with alcohol intake with a particular focus on the involvement of 5-HT(2) (C)R mRNA editing and its association with alcohol preference in mice. RNA editing is a post-transcriptional modification mechanism. In mammals, adenosine is converted to inosine by the deamination enzymes ADAR1 and ADAR2. 5-HT(2) (C)R is the only GPCR subjected to RNA editing within the coding region. It has five editing sites in exon 5 that encode the second intracellular loop. Consequently, three amino acids residues (I156, N158, and I160) of the unedited receptor (INI) may be altered to differently edited isoforms, resulting in a change of receptor activity such as 5-HT potency and G-protein coupling. 5-HT(2) (C)R in the NAc is involved in enhanced alcohol drinking after chronic alcohol exposure and alterations in 5-HT(2) (C)R mRNA editing is important in determining the alcohol preference using different strains of mice and genetically modified mice. RNA editing of this receptor may participate in the development of alcoholism.",2019,Front Neurosci. 2020 Jan 14;13:1390. doi: 10.3389/fnins.2019.01390. eCollection 2019.,"['Tanaka M', 'Watanabe Y']",False
30426900,Comparative Activity of Adenosine Deaminase Acting on RNA (ADARs) Isoforms for Correction of Genetic Code in Gene Therapy.,"INTRODUCTION: Members of the adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) family of enzymes consist of double-stranded RNA-binding domains (dsRBDs) and a deaminase domain (DD) that converts adenosine (A) into inosine (I), which acts as guanosine (G) during translation. Using the MS2 system, we engineered the DD of ADAR1 to direct it to a specific target. The aim of this work was to compare the deaminase activities of ADAR1-DD and various isoforms of ADAR2-DD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We measured the binding affinity of the artificial enzyme system on a Biacore ™ X100. ADARs usually target dsRNA, so we designed a guide RNA complementary to the target RNA, and then fused the guide sequence to the MS2 stem-loop. A mutated amber (TAG) stop codon at 58 amino acid (TGG) of EGFP was targeted. After transfection of these three factors into HEK 293 cells, we observed fluorescence signals of various intensities. RESULTS: ADAR2-long without the Alu-cassette yielded a much higher fluorescence signal than ADAR2-long with the Alu-cassette. With another isoform, ADAR2-short, which is 81 bp shorter at the C-terminus, the fluorescence signal was undetectable. A single amino acid substitution of ADAR2-long-DD (E488Q) rendered the enzyme more active than the wild type. The results of fluorescence microscopy suggested that ADAR1-DD is more active than ADAR2-long-DD. Western blots and sequencing confirmed that ADAR1-DD was more active than any other DD. CONCLUSION: This study provides information that should facilitate the rational use of ADAR variants for genetic restoration and treatment of genetic diseases.",2019,Curr Gene Ther. 2019;19(1):31-39. doi: 10.2174/1566523218666181114122116.,"['Azad MTA', 'Qulsum U', 'Tsukahara T']",True

30911384,Genome-wide identification of RNA editing in seven porcine tissues by matched DNA and RNA high-throughput sequencing.,"BACKGROUND: RNA editing is a co/posttranscriptional modification mechanism that increases the diversity of transcripts, with potential functional consequences. The advent of next-generation sequencing technologies has enabled the identification of RNA edits at unprecedented throughput and resolution. However, our knowledge of RNA editing in swine is still limited. RESULTS: Here, we utilized RES-Scanner to identify RNA editing sites in the brain, subcutaneous fat, heart, liver, muscle, lung and ovary in three 180-day-old Large White gilts based on matched strand-specific RNA sequencing and whole-genome resequencing datasets. In total, we identified 74863 editing sites, and 92.1% of these sites caused adenosine-to-guanosine (A-to-G) conversion. Most A-to-G sites were located in noncoding regions and generally had low editing levels. In total, 151 A-to-G sites were detected in coding regions (CDS), including 94 sites that could lead to nonsynonymous amino acid changes. We provide further evidence supporting a previous observation that pig transcriptomes are highly editable at PRE-1 elements. The number of A-to-G editing sites ranged from 4155 (muscle) to 25001 (brain) across the seven tissues. The expression levels of the ADAR enzymes could explain some but not all of this variation across tissues. The functional analysis of the genes with tissue-specific editing sites in each tissue revealed that RNA editing might play important roles in tissue function. Specifically, more pathways showed significant enrichment in the fat and liver than in other tissues, while no pathway was enriched in the muscle. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified a total of 74863 nonredundant RNA editing sites in seven tissues and revealed the potential importance of RNA editing in tissue function.

30918658,Genome-wide profiling of RNA editing sites in sheep.,"BACKGROUND: The widely observed RNA-DNA differences (RDDs) have been found to be due to nucleotide alteration by RNA editing. Canonical RNA editing (i.e., A-to-I and C-to-U editing) mediated by the adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADAR) family and apolipoprotein B mRNA editing catalytic polypeptide-like (APOBEC) family during the transcriptional process is considered common and essential for the development of an individual. To date, an increasing number of RNA editing sites have been reported in human, rodents, and some farm animals; however, genome-wide detection of RNA editing events in sheep has not been reported. The aim of this study was to identify RNA editing events in sheep by comparing the RNA-seq and DNA-seq data from three biological replicates of the kidney and spleen tissues. RESULTS: A total of 607 and 994 common edited sites within the three biological replicates were identified in the ovine kidney and spleen, respectively. Many of the RDDs were specific to an individual. The RNA editing-related genes identified in the present study might be evolved for specific biological functions in sheep, such as structural constituent of the cytoskeleton and microtubule-based processes. Furthermore, the edited sites found in the ovine BLCAP and NEIL1 genes are in line with those in previous reports on the porcine and human homologs, suggesting the existence of evolutionarily conserved RNA editing sites and they may play an important role in the structure and function of genes. CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first to investigate RNA editing events in sheep. We screened out 607 and 994 RNA editing sites in three biological replicates of the ovine kidney and spleen and annotated 164 and 247 genes in the kidney and spleen, respectively. The gene function and conservation analysis of these RNA editing-related genes suggest that RNA editing is associated with important gene function in sheep. The putative functionally important RNA editing sites reported in the present study will help future studies on the relationship between these edited sites and the genetic traits in sheep.",2019,J Anim Sci Biotechnol. 2019 Mar 12;10:31. doi: 10.1186/s40104-019-0331-z. eCollection 2019.,"['Zhang Y', 'Han D', 'Dong X', 'Wang J', 'Chen J', 'Yao Y', 'Darwish HYA', 'Liu W', 'Deng X']",True

Recent improvements in high throughput sequencing technologies have revealed a more complex miRNAome, due to miRNA sequence modification phenomena, such as RNA editing and isomiRs. As a result, a new class of tools is necessary in order to appropriately investigate this emerging complexity. To address such need, we developed isoTar, a high-performance Web-based containerized application designed for miRNA consensus targeting prediction and functional enrichment analyses. In the present chapter, we provide an overview of isoTar ( https://ncrnaome.osumc.edu/isotar/ ), as well as benchmarks and a guide to its usage.",2019,Methods Mol Biol. 2019;1970:211-235. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4939-9207-2_12.,"['Distefano R', 'Nigita G', 'Veneziano D', 'Romano G', 'Croce CM', 'Acunzo M']",False
31039163,Modulation of ADAR mRNA expression in patients with congenital heart defects.,"Adenosine (A) to inosine (I) RNA editing is a hydrolytic deamination reaction catalyzed by the adenosine deaminase (ADAR) enzyme acting on double-stranded RNA. This posttranscriptional process diversifies a plethora of transcripts, including coding and noncoding RNAs. Interestingly, few studies have been carried out to determine the role of RNA editing in vascular disease. The aim of this study was to determine the potential role of ADARs in congenital heart disease. Strong downregulation of ADAR2 and increase in ADAR1 expression was observed in blood samples from congenital heart disease (CHD) patients. The decrease in expression of ADAR2 was in line with its downregulation in ventricular tissues of dilated cardiomyopathy patients. To further decipher the plausible regulatory pathway of ADAR2 with respect to heart physiology, miRNA profiling of ADAR2 was performed on tissues from ADAR2-/- mouse hearts. Downregulation of miRNAs (miR-29b, miR-405, and miR-19) associated with cardiomyopathy and cardiac fibrosis was observed. Moreover, the upregulation of miR-29b targets COL1A2 and IGF1, indicated that ADAR2 might be involved in cardiac myopathy. The ADAR2 target vascular development associated protein-coding gene filamin B (FLNB) was selected. The editing levels of FLNB were dramatically reduced in ADAR2-/- mice; however, no observable changes in FLNB expression were noted in ADAR2-/- mice compared to wild-type mice. This study proposes that sufficient ADAR2 enzyme activity might play a vital role in preventing cardiovascular defects.",2019,PLoS One. 2019 Apr 30;14(4):e0200968. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0200968. eCollection 2019.,"['Altaf F', 'Vesely C', 'Sheikh AM', 'Munir R', 'Shah STA', 'Tariq A']",True
31133890,Adenosine-to-Inosine RNA Editing Within Corticolimbic Brain Regions Is Regulated in Response to Chronic Social Defeat Stress in Mice.,"Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing is a co-/posttranscriptional modification of double-stranded RNA, catalyzed by the adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) family of enzymes, which results in recognition of inosine as guanosine by translational and splicing machinery causing potential recoding events in amino acid sequences. A-to-I editing is prominent within brain-specific transcripts, and dysregulation of editing at several well-studied loci (e.g., Gria2, Htr2c) has been implicated in acute and chronic stress in rodents as well as neurological (e.g., Alzheimer's) and psychopathological disorders such as schizophrenia and major depressive disorder. However, only a small fraction of recoding sites has been investigated within the brain following stress, and our understanding of the role of RNA editing in transcriptome regulation following environmental stimuli remains poorly understood. Thus, we aimed to investigate A-to-I editing at hundreds of loci following chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) in mice within corticolimbic regions responsive to chronic stress regulation. Adult male mice were subjected to CSDS or control conditions for 21 days and dynamic regulation of A-to-I editing was investigated 2 and 8 days following the final defeat within both the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and basolateral amygdala (BLA). Employing a targeted resequencing approach, which utilizes microfluidics-based multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) coupled with next-generation sequencing, we analyzed A-to-I editing at ∼100 high-confidence editing sites within the mouse brain. CSDS resulted in acute regulation of transcripts encoding several ADAR enzymes, which normalized 8 days following the final defeat and was specific for susceptible mice. In contrast, sequencing analysis revealed modest and dynamic regulation of A-to-I editing within numerous transcripts in both the mPFC and BLA of resilient and susceptible mice at both 2 and 8 days following CSDS with minimal overlap between regions and time points. Editing within the Htr2c transcript and relative abundance of Htr2c messenger RNA (mRNA)variants were also observed within the BLA of susceptible mice 2 days following CSDS. These results indicate dynamic RNA editing within discrete brain regions following CSDS in mice, further implicating A-to-I editing as a stress-sensitive molecular mechanism within the brain of potential relevance to resiliency and susceptibility to CSDS.",2019,Front Psychiatry. 2019 Apr 26;10:277. doi: 10.3389/fpsyt.2019.00277. eCollection 2019.,"['Dick ALW', 'Khermesh K', 'Paul E', 'Stamp F', 'Levanon EY', 'Chen A']",True

In contrast to other methods, including CRISPR/Cas-based, the SNAP-tag is small, well expressed and of human origin. Furthermore, the SNAP-ADAR approach enables the ready inclusion of photo control by caging/decaging of the benzylguanine moiety required for the conjugation reaction with the SNAP-tag. Beyond site-directed RNA editing, the method has high potential for various applications in the field of RNA targeting. However, the generation of the required guideRNAs includes some basic chemistry. Here, we provide step-by-step protocols for (a) conduction of photo controlled RNA editing reaction, (b) the generation of photo activatable guideRNAs, and (c) the synthesis of the caged benzylguanine moiety.

32009885,Altered Biogenesis and MicroRNA Content of Hippocampal Exosomes Following Experimental Status Epilepticus.,"Repetitive or prolonged seizures (status epilepticus) can damage neurons within the hippocampus, trigger gliosis, and generate an enduring state of hyperexcitability. Recent studies have suggested that microvesicles including exosomes are released from brain cells following stimulation and tissue injury, conveying contents between cells including microRNAs (miRNAs). Here, we characterized the effects of experimental status epilepticus on the expression of exosome biosynthesis components and analyzed miRNA content in exosome-enriched fractions. Status epilepticus induced by unilateral intra-amygdala kainic acid in mice resulted in acute subfield-specific, bi-directional changes in hippocampal transcripts associated with exosome biosynthesis including up-regulation of endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT)-dependent and -independent pathways. Increased expression of exosome components including Alix were detectable in samples obtained 2 weeks after status epilepticus and changes occurred in both the ipsilateral and contralateral hippocampus. RNA sequencing of exosome-enriched fractions prepared using two different techniques detected a rich diversity of conserved miRNAs and showed that status epilepticus selectively alters miRNA contents. We also characterized editing sites of the exosome-enriched miRNAs and found six exosome-enriched miRNAs that were adenosine-to-inosine (ADAR) edited with the majority of the editing events predicted to occur within miRNA seed regions. However, the prevalence of these editing events was not altered by status epilepticus. These studies demonstrate that status epilepticus alters the exosome pathway and its miRNA content, but not editing patterns. Further functional studies will be needed to determine if these changes have pathophysiological significance for epileptogenesis.",2019,Front Neurosci. 2020 Jan 17;13:1404. doi: 10.3389/fnins.2019.01404. eCollection 2019.,"['Batool A', 'Hill TDM', 'Nguyen NT', 'Langa E', 'Diviney M', 'Mooney C', 'Brennan GP', 'Connolly NMC', 'Sanz-Rodriguez A', 'Cavanagh BL', 'Henshall DC']",False
29796672,Bidirectional regulation of adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing by DEAH box helicase 9 (DHX9) in cancer.,"Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing entails the enzymatic deamination of adenosines to inosines by adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs). Dysregulated A-to-I editing has been implicated in various diseases, including cancers. However, the precise factors governing the A-to-I editing and their physiopathological implications remain as a long-standing question. Herein, we unravel that DEAH box helicase 9 (DHX9), at least partially dependent of its helicase activity, functions as a bidirectional regulator of A-to-I editing in cancer cells. Intriguingly, the ADAR substrate specificity determines the opposing effects of DHX9 on editing as DHX9 silencing preferentially represses editing of ADAR1-specific substrates, whereas augments ADAR2-specific substrate editing. Analysis of 11 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) reveals a striking overexpression of DHX9 in tumors. Further, tumorigenicity studies demonstrate a helicase-dependent oncogenic role of DHX9 in cancer development. In sum, DHX9 constitutes a bidirectional regulatory mode in A-to-I editing, which is in part responsible for the dysregulated editome profile in cancer.",2018 Sep 6,Nucleic Acids Res. 2018 Sep 6;46(15):7953-7969. doi: 10.1093/nar/gky396.,"['Hong H', 'An O', 'Chan THM', 'Ng VHE', 'Kwok HS', 'Lin JS', 'Qi L', 'Han J', 'Tay DJT', 'Tang SJ', 'Yang H', 'Song Y', 'Bellido Molias F', 'Tenen DG', 'Chen L']",True
28762759,Adenosine-to-Inosine RNA Editing in Health and Disease.,"SIGNIFICANCE: Adenosine deamination in transcriptome results in the formation of inosine, a process that is called A-to-I RNA editing. Adenosine deamination is one of the more than 140 described RNA modifications. A-to-I RNA editing is catalyzed by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) enzymes and is essential for life. Recent Advances: Accumulating evidence supports a critical role of RNA editing in all aspects of RNA metabolism, including mRNA stability, splicing, nuclear export, and localization, as well as in recoding of proteins. These advances have significantly enhanced the understanding of mechanisms involved in development and in homeostasis. Furthermore, recent studies have indicated that RNA editing may be critically involved in cancer, aging, neurological, autoimmune, or cardiovascular diseases. CRITICAL ISSUES: This review summarizes recent and significant achievements in the field of A-to-I RNA editing and discusses the importance and translational value of this RNA modification for gene expression, cellular, and organ function, as well as for disease development.

Recent years have seen abnormalities at the RNA levels being reported to possess potential biological relevance in cancers. ADAR1-mediated A-to-I editing is an important posttranscriptional mechanism in human physiology, and the biological implication of its abnormality, especially at the global level, is underexplored in MM. In this study, we define the biological implications of A-to-I editing and how it contributes to MM pathogenesis. Here, we identified that the MM transcriptome is aberrantly hyperedited because of the overexpression of ADAR1. These events were associated with patients' survival independent of 1q21 amplifications and could affect patients' responsiveness to different treatment regimes. Our functional assays established ADAR1 to be oncogenic, driving cellular growth and proliferation in an editing-dependent manner. In addition, we identified NEIL1 (base-excision repair gene) as an essential and a ubiquitously edited ADAR1 target in MM. The recoded NEIL1 protein showed defective oxidative damage repair capacity and loss-of-function properties. Collectively, our data demonstrated that ADAR1-mediated A-to-I editing is both clinically and biologically relevant in MM.

However, it remains poorly defined whether LPS participates in Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR). Here, we discovered that LPS increased in HSCR tissues. Furthermore, LPS treatment suppressed the proliferation and differentiation of neural precursor cells (NPCs) or proliferation and migration of human 293T cells. ADAR2 (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA2)-mediated post-transcriptional adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing promotes cancer progression. We show that increased LPS activates ADAR2 and subsequently regulates the A-to-I RNA editing which suppresses the miR-142 expression. RNA sequencing combined with qRT-PCR suggested that ADAR2 restrain cell migration and proliferation via pri-miR-142 editing and STAU1 up-regulation. In conclusion, the findings illustrate that LPS participates in HSCR through the LPS-ADAR2-miR-142-STAU1 axis.",2018 Sep,J Cell Mol Med. 2018 Sep;22(9):4045-4055. doi: 10.1111/jcmm.13652.

29694248,ADAR1 attenuates allogeneic graft rejection by suppressing miR-21 biogenesis in macrophages and promoting M2 polarization.,"ADAR1 (adenosine deaminase acting on double-stranded RNA 1) is an RNA-editing enzyme that mediates adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing events, an important post-transcriptional modification mechanism that can alter the coding properties of mRNA or regulate microRNA biogenesis. ADAR1 also regulates the innate immune response. Here, we have demonstrated that ADAR1 expression increased in LPS-stimulated macrophages. Silencing ADAR1 by using small interfering RNA in macrophages resulted in the pronounced polarization of macrophages to M1, whereas ADAR1 overexpression promoted M2 polarization, which indicated that ADAR1 can inhibit macrophage hyperpolarization and prevent immune hyperactivity. The RNA-RNP immunoprecipitation binding assay demonstrated a direct interaction between ADAR1 and miR-21 precursor. Significant up-regulation in IL-10 and down-regulation in miR-21 were observed in ADAR1-overexpressing macrophages. We evaluated miR-21 target mRNAs and macrophage polarization signaling pathways and found that forkhead box protein O1 (Foxo1) was up-regulated in cells that overexpressed ADAR1. In a mouse allogeneic skin transplantation model, grafts in the ADAR1-overexpressed group survived longer and suffered less immune cell infiltration. In ADAR1-overexpressed recipients, splenic macrophages were significantly polarized to M2, and levels of sera IL-10 were markedly higher than those in the control group.

A-to-I editing is currently known to be involved in the regulation of the immune system, RNA splicing, protein recoding, microRNA biogenesis, and formation of heterochromatin. Editing occurs within regions of double-stranded RNA, particularly within inverted Alu repeats, and is associated with many diseases including cancer, neurological disorders, and metabolic syndromes.

Here, we review the current knowledge about the prevalence and function of A-to-I editing by the ADAR protein family, focusing on its role in the regulation of gene expression.

29986212,Enoxacin extends lifespan of C. elegans by inhibiting miR-34-5p and promoting mitohormesis.,"Alterations in microRNA (miRNA) processing have been previously linked to aging. Here we used the small molecule enoxacin to pharmacologically interfere with miRNA biogenesis and study how it affects aging in C. elegans. Enoxacin extended worm lifespan and promoted survival under normal and oxidative stress conditions. Enoxacin-induced longevity required the transcription factor SKN-1/Nrf2 and was blunted by the antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine, suggesting a prooxidant-mediated mitohormetic response. The longevity effects of enoxacin were also dependent on the miRNA pathway, consistent with changes in miRNA expression elicited by the drug. Among these differentially expressed miRNAs, the widely conserved miR-34-5p was found to play an important role in enoxacin-mediated longevity. Enoxacin treatment down-regulated miR-34-5p and did not further extend lifespan of long-lived mir-34 mutants. Moreover, N-acetyl-cysteine abrogated mir-34(gk437)-induced longevity. Evidence also points to double-stranded RNA-specific adenosine deaminases (ADARs) as new targets of enoxacin since ADAR loss-of-function abrogates enoxacin-induced lifespan extension. Thus, enoxacin increases lifespan by reducing miR-34-5p levels, interfering with the redox balance and promoting healthspan.",2018 Sep,Redox Biol. 2018 Sep;18:84-92. doi: 10.1016/j.redox.2018.06.006.

30290838,ADAR1-mediated RNA-editing of 3'UTRs in breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Whole transcriptome RNA variant analyses have shown that adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADAR) enzymes modify a large proportion of cellular RNAs, contributing to transcriptome diversity and cancer evolution. Despite the advances in the understanding of ADAR function in breast cancer, ADAR RNA editing functional consequences are not fully addressed. RESULTS: We characterized A to G(I) mRNA editing in 81 breast cell lines, showing increased editing at 3'UTR and exonic regions in breast cancer cells compared to immortalized non-malignant cell lines. In addition, tumors from the BRCA TCGA cohort show a 24% increase in editing over normal breast samples when looking at 571 well-characterized UTRs targeted by ADAR1. Basal-like subtype breast cancer patients with high level of ADAR1 mRNA expression shows a worse clinical outcome and increased editing in their 3'UTRs. Interestingly, editing was particularly increased in the 3'UTRs of ATM, GINS4 and POLH transcripts in tumors, which correlated with their mRNA expression. We confirmed the role of ADAR1 in this regulation using a shRNA in a breast cancer cell line (ZR-75-1).

30287844,A-to-I RNA editing enzyme ADAR2 regulates light-induced circadian phase-shift.,"In mammals, the central circadian clock is located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus and it orchestrates peripheral clocks in the whole body to organize physiological and behavioral rhythms. Light-induced phase-shift of the SCN clock enables synchronization of the circadian clock system with 24-h environmental light/dark cycle. We previously found that adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 2 (Adar2), an A-to-I RNA editing enzyme catalyzing rhythmic A-to-I RNA editing, governs a wide range of mRNA rhythms in the mouse liver and regulates the circadian behavior. In brain, ADAR2-mediated A-to-I RNA editing was reported to occur in various transcripts encoding ion channels and neurotransmitter receptors, which could influence neuronal function of the SCN. Here we show that ADAR2 plays a crucial role for light-induced phase-shift of the circadian clock.

By monitoring the bioluminescence rhythms of the mutant SCN slices, we found that a phase-advance induced by treatment with pituitary adenylyl cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) was markedly attenuated.

30355979,Thermodynamic Model for B-Z Transition of DNA Induced by Z-DNA Binding Proteins.,"Z-DNA is stabilized by various Z-DNA binding proteins (ZBPs) that play important roles in RNA editing, innate immune response, and viral infection. In this review, the structural and dynamics of various ZBPs complexed with Z-DNA are summarized to better understand the mechanisms by which ZBPs selectively recognize d(CG)-repeat DNA sequences in genomic DNA and efficiently convert them to left-handed Z-DNA to achieve their biological function. The intermolecular interaction of ZBPs with Z-DNA strands is mediated through a single continuous recognition surface which consists of an α3 helix and a β-hairpin. In the ZBP-Z-DNA complexes, three identical, conserved residues (N173, Y177, and W195 in the Zα domain of human ADAR1) play central roles in the interaction with Z-DNA. ZBPs convert a 6-base DNA pair to a Z-form helix via the B-Z transition mechanism in which the ZBP first binds to B-DNA and then shifts the equilibrium from B-DNA to Z-DNA, a conformation that is then selectively stabilized by the additional binding of a second ZBP molecule. During B-Z transition, ZBPs selectively recognize the alternating d(CG)(n) sequence and convert it to a Z-form helix in long genomic DNA through multiple sequence discrimination steps. In addition, the intermediate complex formed by ZBPs and B-DNA, which is modulated by varying conditions, determines the degree of B-Z transition.",2018 Oct 24,Molecules. 2018 Oct 24;23(11):2748. doi: 10.3390/molecules23112748.,"['Lee AR', 'Kim NH', 'Seo YJ', 'Choi SR', 'Lee JH']",True
30202880,A protein-protein interaction underlies the molecular basis for substrate recognition by an adenosine-to-inosine RNA-editing enzyme.,"Adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADARs) convert adenosine to inosine within double-stranded regions of RNA, resulting in increased transcriptomic diversity, as well as protection of cellular double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) from silencing and improper immune activation. The presence of dsRNA-binding domains (dsRBDs) in all ADARs suggests these domains are important for substrate recognition; however, the role of dsRBDs in vivo remains largely unknown. Herein, our studies indicate the Caenorhabditis elegans ADAR enzyme, ADR-2, has low affinity for dsRNA, but interacts with ADR-1, an editing-deficient member of the ADAR family, which has a 100-fold higher affinity for dsRNA. ADR-1 uses one dsRBD to physically interact with ADR-2 and a second dsRBD to bind to dsRNAs, thereby tethering ADR-2 to substrates. ADR-2 interacts with >1200 transcripts in vivo, and ADR-1 is required for 80% of these interactions. Our results identify a novel mode of substrate recognition for ADAR enzymes and indicate that protein-protein interactions can guide substrate recognition for RNA editors.",2018 Oct 12,Nucleic Acids Res. 2018 Oct 12;46(18):9647-9659. doi: 10.1093/nar/gky800.,"['Rajendren S', 'Manning AC', 'Al-Awadi H', 'Yamada K', 'Takagi Y', 'Hundley HA']",True
30087110,RNA editing of Filamin A pre-mRNA regulates vascular contraction and diastolic blood pressure.,"Epitranscriptomic events such as adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing by ADAR can recode mRNAs to translate novel proteins. Editing of the mRNA that encodes actin crosslinking protein Filamin A (FLNA) mediates a Q-to-R transition in the interactive C-terminal region. While FLNA editing is conserved among vertebrates, its physiological function remains unclear. Here, we show that cardiovascular tissues in humans and mice show massive editing and that FLNA RNA is the most prominent substrate. Patient-derived RNA-Seq data demonstrate a significant drop in FLNA editing associated with cardiovascular diseases. Using mice with only impaired FLNA editing, we observed increased vascular contraction and diastolic hypertension accompanied by increased myosin light chain phosphorylation, arterial remodeling, and left ventricular wall thickening, which eventually causes cardiac remodeling and reduced systolic output. These results demonstrate a causal relationship between RNA editing and the development of cardiovascular disease indicating that a single epitranscriptomic RNA modification can maintain cardiovascular health.",2018 Oct 1,EMBO J. 2018 Oct 1;37(19):e94813. doi: 10.15252/embj.201694813.

29460265,miRNA Editing: New Insights into the Fast Control of Gene Expression in Health and Disease.,"Post-transcriptional modifications are essential mechanisms for mRNA biogenesis and function in eukaryotic cells. Beyond well-characterized events such as splicing, capping, and polyadenylation, there are several others, as RNA editing mechanisms and regulation of transcription mediated by miRNAs that are taking increasing attention in the last years. RNA editing through A-to-I deamination increases transcriptomic complexity, generating different proteins with amino acid substitution from the same transcript. On the other hand, miRNAs can regulate gene expression modulating target mRNA decay and translation. Interestingly, recent studies highlight the possibility that miRNAs might undergo editing themselves. This mainly translates in the degradation or uncorrected maturation of miRNAs but also in the recognition of different targets. The presence of edited and unedited forms of the same miRNA may have important biological implications in both health and disease. Here we review ongoing investigations on miRNA RNA editing with the aim to shed light on the growing importance of this mechanism in adding complexity to post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression.",2018 Oct,Mol Neurobiol. 2018 Oct;55(10):7717-7727. doi: 10.1007/s12035-018-0951-x.

30281598,Typhoid fever outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo: Case control and ecological study.,"During 2011 a large outbreak of typhoid fever affected an estimated 1430 people in Kikwit, Democratic Republic of Congo. The outbreak started in military camps in the city but then spread to the general population. This paper reports the results of an ecological analysis and a case-control study undertaken to examine water and other possible transmission pathways. Attack rates were determined for health areas and risk ratios were estimated with respect to spatial exposures. Approximately 15 months after the outbreak, demographic, environmental and exposure data were collected for 320 cases and 640 controls residing in the worst affected areas, using a structured interview questionnaire. Unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios were estimated. Complete data were available for 956 respondents. Residents of areas with water supplied via gravity on the mains network were at much greater risk of disease acquisition (risk ratio = 6.20, 95%CI 3.39-11.35) than residents of areas not supplied by this mains network. In the case control study, typhoid was found to be associated with ever using tap water from the municipal supply (OR = 4.29, 95% CI 2.20-8.38). Visible urine or faeces in the latrine was also associated with increased risk of typhoid and having chosen a water source because it is protected was negatively associated. Knowledge that washing hands can prevent typhoid fever, and stated habit of handwashing habits before cooking or after toileting was associated with increased risk of disease. However, observed associations between handwashing or plate-sharing with disease risk could very likely be due to recall bias. This outbreak of typhoid fever was strongly associated with drinking water from the municipal drinking water supply, based on the descriptive and analytic epidemiology and the finding of high levels of faecal contamination of drinking water. Future outbreaks of potentially waterborne disease need an integrated response that includes epidemiology and environmental microbiology during early stages of the outbreak.",2018 Oct,PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2018 Oct 3;12(10):e0006795. doi: 10.1371/journal.pntd.0006795. eCollection 2018 Oct.,"['Brainard J', ""D'hondt R"", 'Ali E', 'Van den Bergh R', 'De Weggheleire A', 'Baudot Y', 'Patigny F', 'Lambert V', 'Zachariah R', 'Maes P', 'Kuma-Kuma Kenge D', 'Hunter PR']",False
30184200,Sequence preference and structural heterogeneity of BZ junctions.,"BZ junctions, which connect B-DNA to Z-DNA, are necessary for local transformation of B-DNA to Z-DNA in the genome. However, the limited information on the junction-forming sequences and junction structures has led to a lack of understanding of the structural diversity and sequence preferences of BZ junctions. We determined three crystal structures of BZ junctions with diverse sequences followed by spectroscopic validation of DNA conformation. The structural features of the BZ junctions were well conserved regardless of sequences via the continuous base stacking through B-to-Z DNA with A-T base extrusion. However, the sequence-dependent structural heterogeneity of the junctions was also observed in base step parameters that are correlated with steric constraints imposed during Z-DNA formation. Further, circular dichroism and fluorescence-based analysis of BZ junctions revealed that a base extrusion was only found at the A-T base pair present next to a stable dinucleotide Z-DNA unit. Our findings suggest that Z-DNA formation in the genome is influenced by the sequence preference for BZ junctions.",2018 Nov 2,Nucleic Acids Res. 2018 Nov 2;46(19):10504-10513. doi: 10.1093/nar/gky784.,"['Kim D', 'Hur J', 'Han JH', 'Ha SC', 'Shin D', 'Lee S', 'Park S', 'Sugiyama H', 'Kim KK']",True
30298734,Proteogenomics of Adenosine-to-Inosine RNA Editing in the Fruit Fly.,"Adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing is one of the most common types of RNA editing, a posttranscriptional modification made by special enzymes. We present a proteomic study on this phenomenon for Drosophila melanogaster. Three proteome data sets were used in the study: two taken from public repository and the third one obtained here. A customized protein sequence database was generated using results of genome-wide adenosine-to-inosine RNA studies and applied for identifying the edited proteins. The total number of 68 edited peptides belonging to 59 proteins was identified in all data sets. Eight of them being shared between the whole insect, head, and brain proteomes. Seven edited sites belonging to synaptic vesicle and membrane trafficking proteins were selected for validation by orthogonal analysis by Multiple Reaction Monitoring. Five editing events in cpx, Syx1A, Cadps, CG4587, and EndoA were validated in fruit fly brain tissue at the proteome level using isotopically labeled standards. Ratios of unedited-to-edited proteoforms varied from 35:1 ( Syx1A) to 1:2 ( EndoA). Lys-137 to Glu editing of endophilin A may have functional consequences for its interaction to membrane.

30065024,Dynamic temperature-sensitive A-to-I RNA editing in the brain of a heterothermic mammal during hibernation.,"RNA editing diversifies genomically encoded information to expand the complexity of the transcriptome. In ectothermic organisms, including Drosophila and Cephalopoda, where body temperature mirrors ambient temperature, decreases in environmental temperature lead to increases in A-to-I RNA editing and cause amino acid recoding events that are thought to be adaptive responses to temperature fluctuations. In contrast, endothermic mammals, including humans and mice, typically maintain a constant body temperature despite environmental changes. Here, A-to-I editing primarily targets repeat elements, rarely results in the recoding of amino acids, and plays a critical role in innate immune tolerance. Hibernating ground squirrels provide a unique opportunity to examine RNA editing in a heterothermic mammal whose body temperature varies over 30°C and can be maintained at 5°C for many days during torpor. We profiled the transcriptome in three brain regions at six physiological states to quantify RNA editing and determine whether cold-induced RNA editing modifies the transcriptome as a potential mechanism for neuroprotection at low temperature during hibernation. We identified 5165 A-to-I editing sites in 1205 genes with dynamically increased editing after prolonged cold exposure. The majority (99.6%) of the cold-increased editing sites are outside of previously annotated coding regions, 82.7% lie in SINE-derived repeats, and 12 sites are predicted to recode amino acids. Additionally, A-to-I editing frequencies increase with increasing cold-exposure, demonstrating that ADAR remains active during torpor. Our findings suggest that dynamic A-to-I editing at low body temperature may provide a neuroprotective mechanism to limit aberrant dsRNA accumulation during torpor in the mammalian hibernator.",2018 Nov,RNA. 2018 Nov;24(11):1481-1495. doi: 10.1261/rna.066522.118.

30496178,Extensive editing of cellular and viral double-stranded RNA structures accounts for innate immunity suppression and the proviral activity of ADAR1p150.,"The interferon (IFN)-mediated innate immune response is the first line of defense against viruses. However, an IFN-stimulated gene, the adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1), favors the replication of several viruses. ADAR1 binds double-stranded RNA and converts adenosine to inosine by deamination. This form of editing makes duplex RNA unstable, thereby preventing IFN induction. To better understand how ADAR1 works at the cellular level, we generated cell lines that express exclusively either the IFN-inducible, cytoplasmic isoform ADAR1p150, the constitutively expressed nuclear isoform ADAR1p110, or no isoform. By comparing the transcriptome of these cell lines, we identified more than 150 polymerase II transcripts that are extensively edited, and we attributed most editing events to ADAR1p150. Editing is focused on inverted transposable elements, located mainly within introns and untranslated regions, and predicted to form duplex RNA structures. Editing of these elements occurs also in primary human samples, and there is evidence for cross-species evolutionary conservation of editing patterns in primates and, to a lesser extent, in rodents. Whereas ADAR1p150 rarely edits tightly encapsidated standard measles virus (MeV) genomes, it efficiently edits genomes with inverted repeats accidentally generated by a mutant MeV. We also show that immune activation occurs in fully ADAR1-deficient (ADAR1KO) cells, restricting virus growth, and that complementation of these cells with ADAR1p150 rescues virus growth and suppresses innate immunity activation. Finally, by knocking out either protein kinase R (PKR) or mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS)-another protein controlling the response to duplex RNA-in ADAR1KO cells, we show that PKR activation elicits a stronger antiviral response. Thus, ADAR1 prevents innate immunity activation by cellular transcripts that include extensive duplex RNA structures. The trade-off is that viruses take advantage of ADAR1 to elude innate immunity control.",2018 Nov,PLoS Biol. 2018 Nov 29;16(11):e2006577. doi: 10.1371/journal.pbio.2006577. eCollection 2018 Nov.,"['Pfaller CK', 'Donohue RC', 'Nersisyan S', 'Brodsky L', 'Cattaneo R']",False

Utilizing single-molecule FRET assays for Z-DNA forming sequences embedded in a long inactive DNA, we measure thermodynamic populations of ADAR1-bound DNA conformations in both GC and TG repeat sequences. Based on a statistical physics model, we determined quantitatively the affinities of ADAR1 to both Z-form and B-form of these sequences. We also reported what pathways it takes to induce the B-Z transition in those sequences. Due to the high junction energy, an intermediate B* state has to accumulate prior to the B-Z transition. Our study showing the stable B* state supports the active picture for the protein-induced B-Z transition that occurs under a physiological setting.",2018 May 4,Nucleic Acids Res. 2018 May 4;46(8):4129-4137. doi: 10.1093/nar/gky200.,"['Kim SH', 'Lim SH', 'Lee AR', 'Kwon DH', 'Song HK', 'Lee JH', 'Cho M', 'Johner A', 'Lee NK', 'Hong SC']",True
29855470,ADAR1-mediated regulation of melanoma invasion.,"Melanoma cells use different migratory strategies to exit the primary tumor mass and invade surrounding and subsequently distant tissues. We reported previously that ADAR1 expression is downregulated in metastatic melanoma, thereby facilitating proliferation. Here we show that ADAR1 silencing enhances melanoma cell invasiveness and ITGB3 expression. The enhanced invasion is reversed when ITGB3 is blocked with antibodies. Re-expression of wild-type or catalytically inactive ADAR1 establishes this mechanism as independent of RNA editing. We demonstrate that ADAR1 controls ITGB3 expression both at the post-transcriptional and transcriptional levels, via miR-22 and PAX6 transcription factor, respectively. These are proven here as direct regulators of ITGB3 expression. miR-22 expression is controlled by ADAR1 via FOXD1 transcription factor. Clinical relevance is demonstrated in patient-paired progression tissue microarray using immunohistochemistry. The novel ADAR1-dependent and RNA-editing-independent regulation of invasion, mediated by ITGB3, strongly points to a central involvement of ADAR1 in cancer progression and metastasis.",2018 May 31,Nat Commun. 2018 May 31;9(1):2154. doi: 10.1038/s41467-018-04600-2.,"['Nemlich Y', 'Baruch EN', 'Besser MJ', 'Shoshan E', 'Bar-Eli M', 'Anafi L', 'Barshack I', 'Schachter J', 'Ortenberg R', 'Markel G']",True
29846818,An Update on Autoinflammatory Diseases: Interferonopathies.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Type I interferons (IFNαβ) induce the expression of hundreds of genes; thus, it is unsurprising that the initiation, transmission, and resolution of the IFNαβ-mediated immune response is tightly controlled. Mutations that alter nucleic acid processing and recognition, ablate IFNαβ-specific negative feedback mechanisms, or result in dysfunction of the proteasome system can all induce pathogenic IFNαβ signalling and are the focus of this review. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent advances have delineated the precise cytoplasmic mechanisms that facilitate self-DNA to be recognised by cGAS and self-RNA to be recognised by RIG-I or MDA-5. This helps clarify interferonopathies associated with mutations in genes which code for DNase-II and ADAR1, among others. Similarly, loss of function mutations in Pol α, which lowers the presence of antagonistic ligands in the cytosol, or gain of function mutations in RIG-I and MDA-5, result in increased propensity for receptor activation and therefore IFNαβ induction. As the aetiology of monogenic autoinflammatory diseases are uncovered, novel and sometimes unsuspected molecular interactions and signalling pathways are being defined. This review covers developments that have come to light over the past 3 years, with reference to the study of interferonopathies.",2018 May 30,Curr Rheumatol Rep. 2018 May 30;20(7):38. doi: 10.1007/s11926-018-0748-y.,"['Davidson S', 'Steiner A', 'Harapas CR', 'Masters SL']",False

29691679,The impact of next-generation sequencing on the diagnosis of pediatric-onset hereditary spastic paraplegias: new genotype-phenotype correlations for rare HSP-related genes.,"Hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSP) are clinical and genetic heterogeneous diseases with more than 80 disease genes identified thus far. Studies on large cohorts of HSP patients showed that, by means of current technologies, the percentage of genetically solved cases is close to 50%. Notably, the percentage of molecularly confirmed diagnoses decreases significantly in sporadic patients. To describe our diagnostic molecular genetic approach on patients with pediatric-onset pure and complex HSP, 47 subjects with HSP underwent molecular screening of 113 known and candidate disease genes by targeted capture and massively parallel sequencing. Negative cases were successively analyzed by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) analysis for the SPAST gene and high-resolution SNP array analysis for genome-wide CNV detection. Diagnosis was molecularly confirmed in 29 out of 47 (62%) patients, most of whom had clinical diagnosis of cHSP. Although SPG11 and SPG4 remain the most frequent cause of, respectively, complex and pure HSP, a large number of pathogenic variants were disclosed in POLR3A, FA2H, DDHD2, ATP2B4, ENTPD1, ERLIN2, CAPN1, ALS2, ADAR1, RNASEH2B, TUBB4A, ATL1, and KIF1A. In a subset of these disease genes, phenotypic expansion and novel genotype-phenotype correlations were recognized.

29740948,"Astrocytes, an active player in Aicardi-Goutières syndrome.","Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS) is an early-onset, autoimmune and genetically heterogeneous disorder with severe neurologic injury. Molecular studies have established that autosomal recessive mutations in one of the following genes are causative: TREX1, RNASEH2A, RNASEH2B, RNASEH2C, SAMHD1, ADAR1 and IFIH1/MDA5. The phenotypic presentation and pathophysiology of AGS is associated with over-production of the cytokine Interferon-alpha (IFN-α) and its downstream signaling, characterized as type I interferonopathy. Astrocytes are one of the major source of IFN in the central nervous system (CNS) and it is proposed that they could be key players in AGS pathology. Astrocytes are the most ubiquitous glial cell in the CNS and perform a number of crucial and complex functions ranging from formation of blood-brain barrier, maintaining ionic homeostasis, metabolic support to synapse formation and elimination in healthy CNS. Involvement of astrocytic dysfunction in neurological diseases-Alexander's disease, Epilepsy, Alzheimer's and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-has been well-established. It is now known that compromised astrocytic function can contribute to CNS abnormalities and severe neurodegeneration, nevertheless, its contribution in AGS is unclear. The current review discusses known molecular and cellular pathways for AGS mutations and how it stimulates IFN-α signaling. We shed light on how astrocytes might be key players in the phenotypic presentations of AGS and emphasize the cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous role of astrocytes.

Heterozygous mutations in the adenosine deaminase acting on RNA1 gene (ADAR1) cause DSH. In the present study, we report five cases of DSH and identify a distinct known mutation in each patient. Furthermore, we review previously described cases with the five ADAR1 mutations found in the present study. We reviewed clinical and molecular findings in the present and previously reported cases and found an identical mutation can result in various phenotypic severities, even in one family. We found novel phenotype-genotype correlations between the presence/absence of facial lesions and the ADAR1 mutation c.3286C>T. The absence of freckle-like macules in the face was found to be more commonly associated with the mutation c.3286C>T than with the other 4 ADAR1 mutations (odds ratio = 0.056 [95% CI: 0.007-0.47, p < 0.005]). We objectively evaluated the severity of skin manifestations in the extremities using our definition of severity levels for such manifestations. This is the first semi-quantitative evaluation of skin manifestations in DSH. Using our definition, we found that patients with facial lesions with or without hypopigmented macules tend to show more severe symptoms on the extremities than patients without facials lesions show. Furthermore, no significant difference in the severity of the skin lesions was observed between the upper and the lower extremities, suggesting that sun exposure does not affect significantly the pathogenesis of DSH skin lesions.",2018 May,Nagoya J Med Sci. 2018 May;80(2):267-277. doi: 10.18999/nagjms.80.2.267.,"['Kobayashi T', 'Kono M', 'Suganuma M', 'Akita H', 'Takai A', 'Tsutsui K', 'Inasaka Y', 'Takeichi T', 'Muro Y', 'Akiyama M']",True
30197877,ADAR Mediated RNA Editing Modulates MicroRNA Targeting in Human Breast Cancer.,"RNA editing by RNA specific adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) is increasingly being found to alter microRNA (miRNA) regulation. Editing of miRNA transcripts can affect their processing, as well as which messenger RNAs (mRNAs) they target. Further, editing of target mRNAs can also affect their complementarity to miRNAs. Notably, ADAR editing is often increased in malignancy with the effect of these RNA changes being largely unclear. In addition, numerous reports have now identified an array of miRNAs that directly contribute to various malignancies although the majority of their targets remain largely undefined. Here we propose that modulating the targets of miRNAs via mRNA editing is a frequent occurrence in cancer and an underappreciated participant in pathology. In order to more accurately characterize the relationship between these two regulatory processes, this study examined RNA editing events within mRNA sequences of two breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) and determined whether or not these edits could modulate miRNA associations. Computational analyses of RNA-Seq data from these two cell lines identified over 50,000 recurrent editing sites within human mRNAs, and many of these were located in 3' untranslated regions (UTRs). When these locations were screened against the list of currently-annotated miRNAs we discovered that editing caused a subset (~9%) to have significant alterations to mRNA complementarity. One miRNA in particular, miR-140-3p, is known to be misexpressed in many breast cancers, and we found that mRNA editing allowed this miRNA to directly target the apoptosis inducing gene DFFA in MCF-7, but not in MDA-MB-231 cells. As these two cell lines are known to have distinct characteristics in terms of morphology, invasiveness and physiological responses, we hypothesized that the differential RNA editing of DFFA in these two cell lines could contribute to their phenotypic differences. Indeed, we confirmed through western blotting that inhibiting miR-140-3p increases expression of the DFFA protein product in MCF-7, but not MDA-MB-231, and further that inhibition of miR-140-3p also increases cellular growth in MCF-7, but not MDA-MB-231. Broadly, these results suggest that the creation of miRNA targets may be an underappreciated function of ADAR and may help further elucidate the role of RNA editing in tumor pathogenicity.",2018 May,Processes (Basel). 2018 May;6(5):42. doi: 10.3390/pr6050042.

C8-guanine adducts from various carcinogenic compounds have been shown to be potent Z-DNA inducers. Hence, it has been hypothesized that Z-DNA plays a role in cancer and other genetic diseases. In this comprehensive review, Z-DNA and the effect of prevalent C8-guanine adducts on the B-Z transition are addressed. The discoveries of Z-DNA binding proteins including ADAR1, E3L, DLM1, and PKZ have suggested the relevance of Z-DNA in living systems. In addition, increasing evidence on the Z-DNA connection to gene transcription and inhibition reveals potential biological functions of the left-handed DNA.

29457714,Selective Recognition of RNA Substrates by ADAR Deaminase Domains.,"Adenosine deamination is one of the most prevalent post-transcriptional modifications in mRNA and is catalyzed by ADAR1 and ADAR2 in humans. ADAR1 and ADAR2 have different substrate selectivity, which is believed to mainly originate from the proteins' deaminase domains (hADAR1d and hADAR2d, respectively). RNA-seq of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcriptome subjected to ADAR-catalyzed RNA editing identified substrates with common secondary structure features preferentially edited by hADAR1d over hADAR2d. The relatively small size and efficient reaction of one of these substrates suggested it could be useful for further study of the hADAR1d reaction. Indeed, a short hairpin stem from the S. cerevisiae HER1 mRNA was efficiently deaminated by hADAR1d and used to generate an hADAR1d-specific fluorescent reporter of editing activity. Using substrates preferred by either hADAR1d or hADAR2d in vitro, we found that a chimeric protein bearing an RNA-binding loop from hADAR2d grafted onto hADAR1d showed ADAR2-like selectivity. Finally, a high-throughput mutagenesis analysis (Sat-FACS-Seq) of conserved residues in an RNA-binding loop of hADAR1d revealed essential amino acids for function, advancing our understanding of RNA recognition by this domain.",2018 Mar 13,Biochemistry. 2018 Mar 13;57(10):1640-1651. doi: 10.1021/acs.biochem.7b01100.

Epigenetic studies have suggested that Htr2c RNA editing is closely related to aggressive behavior. This study aims to obtain a fundamental understanding of how social isolation impacts adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1, RNA editing enzyme) and Htr2c RNA editing, leading to aggressive behavior, and explore the effective solutions for the recovery of this behavior. METHODS: We evaluated 21-day-old BALB/c mice with and without isolation for aggressive behavior using a resident-intruder test. Immune-reactivity and protein expression of ADAR1 (p110) were measured using immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. Htr2c RNA editing was evaluated using pyrosequencing. In addition, the 5-HT (2C) R antagonist SB243213/5-HT (2C) R inverse agonist SB206553 was used to treat the isolated mice, and the performance of both treatments on the behavior, ADAR1 (p110) expression, and Htr2c RNA editing in isolated mice was examined. RESULTS: Both the protein expression and immune-reactivity of ADAR1 (p110) in the amygdala decreased, but the percentage of Htr2c RNA editing at A and B sites of amygdala only showed a moderate increase in isolated BALB/c mice with enhanced aggressive behavior compared to the age-matched group-housed BALB/c mice. Additionally, treatment with the 5-HT (2C) R antagonist SB243213/5-HT (2C) R inverse agonist SB206553 recovered the enhanced aggressive behavior of isolated mice and returned the protein expression and immune-reactivity of ADAR1 (p110) back to the normal level. Moreover, compared to the age-matched isolated mice treated with physiological saline, isolated mice treated with 5-HT (2C) R inverse agonist SB206553 showed a lower percentage of Htr2c RNA editing at both A and B sites, and the same result occurred in isolated mice treated with 5-HT (2C) R antagonist SB243213 at B site of Htr2c RNA editing. CONCLUSIONS: The 5-HT (2C) R antagonist SB243213/5-HT (2C) R inverse agonist SB206553 recovered increased aggressive behavior of isolated BALB/c mice mediated by ADAR1 (p110) expression and Htr2c RNA editing.",2018 Mar,Brain Behav. 2018 Feb 7;8(3):e00929. doi: 10.1002/brb3.929. eCollection 2018 Mar.,"['Yu W', 'Xu H', 'Xue Y', 'An D', 'Li H', 'Chen W', 'Yu D', 'Sun Y', 'Ma J', 'Tang Y', 'Xiao Z', 'Yin S']",True
29396793,Post-transcriptional regulation of LINE-1 retrotransposition by AID/APOBEC and ADAR deaminases.,"Long interspersed element-1 (LINE-1 or L1) retrotransposons represent the only functional family of autonomous transposable elements in humans and formed 17% of our genome. Even though most of the human L1 sequences are inactive, a limited number of copies per individual retain the ability to mobilize by a process termed retrotransposition. The ongoing L1 retrotransposition may result in insertional mutagenesis that could lead to negative consequences such as genetic disease and cancer. For this reason, cells have evolved several mechanisms of defense to restrict L1 activity. Among them, a critical role for cellular deaminases [activation-induced deaminase (AID)/apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing catalytic polypeptide-like (APOBEC) and adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADAR) enzymes] has emerged. The majority of the AID/APOBEC family of proteins are responsible for the deamination of cytosine to uracil (C-to-U editing) within DNA and RNA targets. The ADARs convert adenosine bases to inosines (A-to-I editing) within double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) targets.

29769310,Tumor-associated intronic editing of HNRPLL generates a novel splicing variant linked to cell proliferation.,"Processing of the eukaryotic transcriptome is a dynamic regulatory mechanism that confers genetic diversity, and splicing and adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing are well-characterized examples of such processing. Growing evidence reveals the cross-talk between the splicing and RNA editing, but there is a paucity of substantial evidence for its mechanistic details and contribution in a physiological context. Here, our findings demonstrate that tumor-associated differential RNA editing, in conjunction with splicing machinery, regulates the expression of variants of HNRPLL, a gene encoding splicing factor. We discovered an HNRPLL transcript variant containing an additional exon 12A (E12A), which is a substrate of ADAR1 and ADAR2. Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADAR) direct deaminase-dependent expression of the E12A transcript, and ADAR-mediated regulation of E12A is largely splicing-based, and does not affect the stability or nucleocytoplasmic distribution of the transcript. Furthermore, ADAR-mediated modification of exon 12A generates an enhancer for the oncogenic splicing factor SRSF1 and consequently promotes the frequency of alternative splicing. Gene expression profiling by RNA-seq revealed that E12A acts distinctly from HNRPLL and regulates a set of growth-related genes, such as cyclin CCND1 and growth factor receptor TGFBR1 Accordingly, silencing E12A expression leads to impaired clonogenic ability and enhanced sensitivity to doxorubicin, thus highlighting the significance of this alternative isoform in tumor cell survival. In summary, we present the interplay of RNA editing and splicing as a regulatory mechanism of gene expression and also its physiological relevance. These findings extend our understanding of transcriptional dynamics and provide a mechanistic explanation to the link of RNA editors to tumorigenesis.",2018 Jun 29,J Biol Chem. 2018 Jun 29;293(26):10158-10171. doi: 10.1074/jbc.RA117.001197.

However, the clinical significance and the functional role of RNA editing in colorectal cancer (CRC) remain unclear. We have systematically and comprehensively investigated the significance of the expression status of ADAR1 and of the RNA editing levels of antizyme inhibitor 1 (AZIN1), one of the most frequently edited genes in cancers, in 392 colorectal tissues from multiple independent CRC patient cohorts. Both ADAR1 expression and AZIN1 RNA editing levels were significantly elevated in CRC tissues when compared with corresponding normal mucosa. High levels of AZIN1 RNA editing emerged as a prognostic factor for overall survival and disease-free survival and were an independent risk factor for lymph node and distant metastasis. Furthermore, elevated AZIN1 editing identified high-risk stage II CRC patients. Mechanistically, edited AZIN1 enhances stemness and appears to drive the metastatic processes. We have demonstrated that edited AZIN1 functions as an oncogene and a potential therapeutic target in CRC.

In this study, we report that endogenous LINE1 components trigger IFNβ production in multiple human cell types, including those defective for cGAS/STING-mediated DNA sensing. In these cells, LINE1 DNA synthesis and retrotransposition were not required for LINE1-triggered immune activation, but RNA sensing pathways were essential. LINE1-triggered immune activation could be suppressed by diverse LINE1 inhibitors, including AGS-associated proteins targeting LINE1 RNA or proteins. However, AGS-associated ADAR1 or TREX1 mutants were defective in suppressing LINE1 retrotransposition or LINE1-triggered immune activation.

Methods: Tumor samples of gastric cancers and preoperative peripheral blood samples from 30 patients were collected respectively from January to March, 2016 in the department of general surgery, Chinese PLA General Hospital. Exome sequencing on samples were performed. Using peripheral bloods as control, mutations in tumor samples were discovered by Mutect and Varscan. Frequently mutated gastric cancer-related genes were defined as genes mutated more frequently than TP53. Difference between the mutant and wild-type of certain genes were compared on common clinicopathological phenotypes, such as age, gender, tumor position, differentiation, metastasis lymph nodes, etc. Results: There were 27 frequently mutated genes were founded, most of which showed no relationship with clinicopathological phenotypes of gastric cancer.

29146145,ADARs and editing: The role of A-to-I RNA modification in cancer progression.,"Cancer arises when pathways that control cell functions such as proliferation and migration are dysregulated to such an extent that cells start to divide uncontrollably and eventually spread throughout the body, ultimately endangering the survival of an affected individual. It is well established that somatic mutations are important in cancer initiation and progression as well as in creation of tumor diversity. Now also modifications of the transcriptome are emerging as a significant force during the transition from normal cell to malignant tumor. Editing of adenosine (A) to inosine (I) in double-stranded RNA, catalyzed by adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs), is one dynamic modification that in a combinatorial manner can give rise to a very diverse transcriptome. Since the cell interprets inosine as guanosine (G), editing can result in non-synonymous codon changes in transcripts as well as yield alternative splicing, but also affect targeting and disrupt maturation of microRNA. ADAR editing is essential for survival in mammals but its dysregulation can lead to cancer. ADAR1 is for instance overexpressed in, e.g., lung cancer, liver cancer, esophageal cancer and chronic myoelogenous leukemia, which with few exceptions promotes cancer progression. In contrast, ADAR2 is lowly expressed in e.g. glioblastoma, where the lower levels of ADAR2 editing leads to malignant phenotypes. Altogether, RNA editing by the ADAR enzymes is a powerful regulatory mechanism during tumorigenesis. Depending on the cell type, cancer progression seems to mainly be induced by ADAR1 upregulation or ADAR2 downregulation, although in a few cases ADAR1 is instead downregulated. In this review, we discuss how aberrant editing of specific substrates contributes to malignancy.",2018 Jul,Semin Cell Dev Biol. 2018 Jul;79:123-130. doi: 10.1016/j.semcdb.2017.11.018.

29691780,Combinatory RNA-Sequencing Analyses Reveal a Dual Mode of Gene Regulation by ADAR1 in Gastric Cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) is known to mediate deamination of adenosine-to-inosine through binding to double-stranded RNA, the phenomenon known as RNA editing. Currently, the function of ADAR1 in gastric cancer is unclear. AIMS: This study was aimed at investigating RNA editing-dependent and editing-independent functions of ADAR1 in gastric cancer, especially focusing on its influence on editing of 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) and subsequent changes in expression of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) as well as microRNAs (miRNAs). METHODS: RNA-sequencing and small RNA-sequencing were performed on AGS and MKN-45 cells with a stable ADAR1 knockdown. Changed frequencies of editing and mRNA and miRNA expression were then identified by bioinformatic analyses. Targets of RNA editing were further validated in patients' samples. RESULTS: In the Alu region of both gastric cell lines, editing was most commonly of the A-to-I type in 3'-UTR or intron. mRNA and protein levels of PHACTR4 increased in ADAR1 knockdown cells, because of the loss of seed sequences in 3'-UTR of PHACTR4 mRNA that are required for miRNA-196a-3p binding. Immunohistochemical analyses of tumor and paired normal samples from 16 gastric cancer patients showed that ADAR1 expression was higher in tumors than in normal tissues and inversely correlated with PHACTR4 staining. On the other hand, decreased miRNA-148a-3p expression in ADAR1 knockdown cells led to increased mRNA and protein expression of NFYA, demonstrating ADAR1's editing-independent function.

29957488,APOBEC and ADAR deaminases may cause many single nucleotide polymorphisms curated in the OMIM database.,"Cytosine and adenosine deamination events (DNA, RNA substrates) account for most codon-context Targeted Somatic Mutation (TSM) patterns observed in immunoglobulin (Ig) somatic hypermutation (SHM), and in cancer exomes following Ig-SHM-like responses. TSM refers to the process of somatic mutagenesis involving deamination events that results on a dominant type of mutation (e.g., C-to-T), and co-incident at a particular motif (e.g., WRC), and preferentially targeting the first, second or third nucleotide position within the mutated codon (e.g. MC1, MC2 or MC3, read 5-prime to 3-prime). It is now widely accepted that if left uncorrected, the accumulation of uncorrected TSMs involving the deaminases, may lead to a diagnosis of cancer or other degenerative disease. Our hypothesis is that many missense, nonsense and synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with clinically significant diseases may have arisen in the population by similar highly targeted deamination events. The OMIM database was searched for disease-associated SNPs on the X chromosome, and for all chromosomes. The nucleotide substitution patterns for disease-associated SNPs were analyzed by the TSM method to identify the likely deaminase source for C-to-U (C-to-T/G-to-A) and A-to-I (A-to-G/T-to-C) derived gene mutations preferentially targeting known sequence motifs associated with the deaminases: AID, APOBEC3G, APOBEC3B and ADAR 1/2. Of the 789 OMIM SNPs analysed. In both data sets, the mutation targeting preferences within the mutated codon reveal a statistically significant bias (p < 0.001). The results imply that a deamination of C-site and A-site targets are written into the human germline for the chromosome wide exomic SNPs analysed.

We used the highly accurate microfluidics-based multiplex PCR sequencing (mmPCR-seq) technique to assess the effects of development and environmental stress on A-to-I editing at 146 pre-selected, conserved sites in the rat prefrontal cortex and amygdala. Furthermore, we asked whether changes in editing can be observed in offspring of stress-exposed rats. In parallel, we assessed changes in ADARs expression levels. RESULTS: In agreement with previous studies, we found editing to be generally higher in adult compared to neonatal rat brain. At birth, editing was generally lower in prefrontal cortex than in amygdala. Stress affected editing at the serotonin receptor 2c (Htr2c), and editing at this site was significantly altered in offspring of rats exposed to prereproductive stress across two generations. Stress-induced changes in Htr2c editing measured with mmPCR-seq were comparable to changes measured with Sanger and Illumina sequencing. Developmental and stress-induced changes in Adar and Adarb1 mRNA expression were observed but did not correlate with editing changes. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that mmPCR-seq can accurately detect A-to-I RNA editing in rat brain samples, and confirm previous accounts of a developmental increase in RNA editing rates.

Both the presence and extent of A-to-I sites in m(6)A-negative RNA transcripts suggest a negative correlation between m(6)A and A-to-I. Suppression of m(6)A-catalyzing enzymes results in global A-to-I RNA editing changes.

Although highly efficient on-target editing has been reported, off-target events have not been rigorously quantified. In this report we target premature termination codons (PTCs) in messages encoding both a fluorescent reporter protein and the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) protein transiently transfected into human epithelial cells. We demonstrate that while on-target editing is efficient, off-target editing is extensive, both within the targeted message and across the entire transcriptome of the transfected cells. By redirecting the editing enzymes from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, off-target editing is reduced without compromising the on-target editing efficiency. The addition of the E488Q mutation to the editing enzymes, a common strategy for increasing on-target editing efficiency, causes a tremendous increase in off-target editing. These results underscore the need to reduce promiscuity in current approaches to SDRE.",2018 Jan 2,RNA Biol. 2018 Jan 2;15(1):104-114. doi: 10.1080/15476286.2017.1387711.

29363428,A survey on cellular RNA editing activity in response to Candida albicans infections.,"BACKGROUND: Adenosine-to-Inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing is catalyzed by the adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) family of enzymes, which induces alterations in mRNA sequence. It has been shown that A-to-I RNA editing events are of significance in the cell's innate immunity and cellular response to viral infections. However, whether RNA editing plays a role in cellular response to microorganism/fungi infection has not been determined. Candida albicans, one of the most prevalent human pathogenic fungi, usually act as a commensal on skin and superficial mucosal, but has been found to cause candidiasis in immunosuppression patients. Previously, we have revealed the up-regulation of A-to-I RNA editing activity in response to different types of influenza virus infections. The current work is designed to study the effect of microorganism/fungi infection on the activity of A-to-I RNA editing in infected hosts. RESULTS: We first detected and characterized the A-to-I RNA editing events in oral epithelial cells (OKF6) and primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), under normal growth condition or with C. albicans infection. Eighty nine thousand six hundred forty eight and 60,872 A-to-I editing sites were detected in normal OKF6 and HUVEC cells, respectively. They were validated against the RNA editing databases, DARNED, RADAR, and REDIportal with 50, 80, and 80% success rates, respectively. While over 95% editing sites were detected in Alu regions, among the rest of the editing sites in non repetitive regions, the majority was located in introns and UTRs. The distributions of A-to-I editing activity and editing depth were analyzed during the course of C. albicans infection. While the normalized editing levels of common editing sites exhibited a significant increase, especially in Alu regions, no significant change in the expression of ADAR1 or ADAR2 was observed. Second, we performed further analysis on data from in vivo mouse study with C. albicans infection. One thousand one hundred thirty three and 955 A-to-I editing sites were identified in mouse tongue and kidney tissues, respectively. The number of A-to-I editing events was much smaller than in human epithelial or endothelial cells, due to the lack of Alu elements in mouse genome. Furthermore, during the course of C. albicans infection we observed stable level of A-to-I editing activity in 131 and 190 common editing sites in the mouse tongue and kidney tissues, and found no significant change in ADAR1 or ADAR2 expression (with the exception of ADAR2 displaying a significant increase at 12 h after infection in mouse kidney tissue before returning to normal). CONCLUSIONS: This work represents the first comprehensive analysis of A-to-I RNA editome in human epithelial and endothelial cells. C. albicans infection of human epithelial and endothelial cells led to the up-regulation of A-to-I editing activities, through a mechanism different from that of viral infections in human hosts. However, the in vivo mouse model with C. albicans infection did not show significant changes in A-to-I editing activities in tongue and kidney tissues. The different results in the mouse model were likely due to the presence of more complex in vivo environments, e.g. circulation and mixed cell types.",2018 Jan 19,BMC Genomics. 2018 Jan 19;19(Suppl 1):43. doi: 10.1186/s12864-017-4374-2.,"['Huang Y', 'Cao Y', 'Li J', 'Liu Y', 'Zhong W', 'Li X', 'Chen C', 'Hao P']",True
29363430,A comprehensive study on cellular RNA editing activity in response to infections with different subtypes of influenza a viruses.,"BACKGROUND: RNA editing is an important mechanism that expands the diversity and complexity of genetic codes. The conversions of adenosine (A) to inosine (I) and cytosine (C) to uridine (U) are two prominent types of RNA editing in animals. The roles of RNA editing events have been implicated in important biological pathways. Cellular RNA editing activity in response to influenza A virus infection has not been fully characterized in human and avian hosts. This study was designed as a big data analysis to investigate the role and response of RNA editing in epithelial cells during the course of infection with various subtypes of influenza A viruses. RESULTS: Using a bioinformatics pipeline modified from our previous study, we characterized the profiles of A-to-I and C-to-U RNA editing events in human epithelial cells during the course of influenza A virus infection. Our results revealed a striking diversity of A-to-I RNA editing activities in human epithelial cells in responses to different subtypes of influenza A viruses. The infection of H1N1 and H3N2 significantly up-regulated normalized A-to-I RNA editing levels in human epithelial cells, whereas that of H5N1 did not change it and H7N9 infection significantly down-regulated normalized A-to-I editing level in A549 cells. Next, the expression levels of ADAR and APOBEC enzymes responsible for A-to-I and C-to-U RNA editing during the course of virus infection were examined. The increase of A-to-I RNA editing activities in infections with some influenza A viruses (H1N1 and H3N2) is linked to the up-regulation of ADAR1 but not ADAR2. Further, the pattern recognition receptors of human epithelial cells infected with H1N1, H3N2, H5N1 and H7N9 were examined. Variable responsive changes in gene expression were observed with RIG-I like receptors and Toll like receptors. Finally, the effect of influenza A virus infection on cellular RNA editing activity was also analyzed in avian hosts. CONCLUSION: This work represents the first comprehensive study of cellular RNA editing activity in response to different influenza A virus infections in human and avian hosts, highlighting the critical role of RNA editing in innate immune response and the pathogenicity of different subtypes of influenza A viruses.",2018 Jan 19,BMC Genomics. 2018 Jan 19;19(Suppl 1):925. doi: 10.1186/s12864-017-4330-1.,"['Cao Y', 'Cao R', 'Huang Y', 'Zhou H', 'Liu Y', 'Li X', 'Zhong W', 'Hao P']",True
28716651,Significance of A-to-I RNA editing of transcripts modulating pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.,"RNA editing is a post-transcriptional process that alters the nucleotide sequence of RNA transcripts to generate transcriptome diversity. Among the various types of RNA editing, adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing is the most frequent type of RNA editing in mammals. Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADAR) enzymes, ADAR1 and ADAR2, convert adenosines in double-stranded RNA structures into inosines by hydrolytic deamination. Inosine forms a base pair with cytidine as if it were guanosine; therefore, the conversion may affect the amino acid sequence, splicing, microRNA targeting, and miRNA maturation. It became apparent that disrupted RNA editing or abnormal ADAR expression is associated with several diseases including cancer, neurological disorders, metabolic diseases, viral infections, and autoimmune disorders. The biological significance of RNA editing in pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD)-related genes is starting to be demonstrated. The authors conducted pioneering studies to reveal that RNA editing modulates drug metabolism potencies in the human liver, as well as the response of cancer cells to chemotherapy agents. Awareness of the importance of RNA editing in drug therapy is growing. This review summarizes the current knowledge on the RNA editing that affects the expression and function of drug response-related genes. Continuing studies on the RNA editing that regulates pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics would provide new beneficial information for personalized medicine.",2018 Jan,Pharmacol Ther. 2018 Jan;181:13-21. doi: 10.1016/j.pharmthera.2017.07.003.

METHODS: Neurotransmitter determinations in CSF from 1200 patients revealed abnormal values in 228 (19%) cases. In 54/228 (24%) patients, a final diagnosis was identified. RESULTS: We have reported primary (30/54, 56%) and secondary (24/54, 44%) monoamine neurotransmitter disorders. For primary deficiencies, the most frequently mutated gene was DDC (n = 9), and the others included PAH with neuropsychiatric features (n = 4), PTS (n = 5), QDPR (n = 3), SR (n = 1), and TH (n = 1). We have also identified mutations in SLC6A3, FOXG1 (n = 1 of each), MTHFR (n = 3), FOLR1, and MTHFD (n = 1 of each), for dopamine transporter, neuronal development, and folate metabolism disorders, respectively. For secondary deficiencies, we have identified POLG (n = 3), ACSF3 (n = 1), NFU1, and SDHD (n = 1 of each), playing a role in mitochondrial function. Other mutated genes included: ADAR, RNASEH2B, RNASET2, SLC7A2-IT1 A/B lncRNA, and EXOSC3 involved in nuclear and cytoplasmic metabolism; RanBP2 and CASK implicated in post-traductional and scaffolding modifications; SLC6A19 regulating amino acid transport; MTM1, KCNQ2 (n = 2), and ATP1A3 playing a role in nerve cell electrophysiological state.

29221912,Variable clinical phenotype in two siblings with Aicardi-Goutières syndrome type 6 and a novel mutation in the ADAR gene.,"Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS) is a hereditary inflammatory encephalopathy resulting in severe neurological damage in the majority of cases. We report on two siblings with AGS6 due to compound heterozygosity for a known and a novel mutation in the ADAR gene and a strikingly variable phenotype. The first sibling presented at 12 months of age with a subacute encephalopathy following a mild respiratory infection. The child developed a spastic tetraparesis, generalized dystonia and dysarthria. In contrast, the younger sibling presented with an acute episode of neurological impairment in his third year of life, from which he recovered without sequelae within a few weeks. These findings illustrate a striking intrafamilial phenotypic variability in patients with AGS6 and describe the first case of a full recovery from an acute encephalopathy in an AGS patient. Our findings also suggest that AGS should be considered as an important differential diagnosis of an infection-triggered encephalopathy in infancy despite the absence of typical neuroimaging findings.",2018 Jan,Eur J Paediatr Neurol. 2018 Jan;22(1):186-189. doi: 10.1016/j.ejpn.2017.11.003.

29273356,Global Transcriptome Analysis of RNA Abundance Regulation by ADAR in Lung Adenocarcinoma.,"Despite tremendous advances in targeted therapies against lung adenocarcinoma, the majority of patients do not benefit from personalized treatments. A deeper understanding of potential therapeutic targets is crucial to increase the survival of patients. One promising target, ADAR, is amplified in 13% of lung adenocarcinomas and in-vitro studies have demonstrated the potential of its therapeutic inhibition to inhibit tumor growth. ADAR edits millions of adenosines to inosines within the transcriptome, and while previous studies of ADAR in cancer have solely focused on protein-coding edits, >99% of edits occur in non-protein coding regions. Here, we develop a pipeline to discover the regulatory potential of RNA editing sites across the entire transcriptome and apply it to lung adenocarcinoma tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas. This method predicts that 1413 genes contain regulatory edits, predominantly in non-coding regions. Genes with the largest numbers of regulatory edits are enriched in both apoptotic and innate immune pathways, providing a link between these known functions of ADAR and its role in cancer. We further show that despite a positive association between ADAR RNA expression and apoptotic and immune pathways, ADAR copy number is negatively associated with apoptosis and several immune cell types' signatures.",2018 Jan,EBioMedicine. 2018 Jan;27:167-175. doi: 10.1016/j.ebiom.2017.12.005.

Mutations in ADAR1, an adenosine-to-inosine editing enzyme of dsRNA, cause Aicardi-Goutières syndrome, an autoinflammatory disorder associated with spontaneous interferon production and neurologic sequelae. We generated ADAR1 knockout human cells to explore ADAR1 substrates and function. ADAR1 primarily edited Alu elements in RNA polymerase II (pol II)-transcribed mRNAs, but not putative pol III-transcribed Alus. During the IFN response, ADAR1 blocked translational shutdown by inhibiting hyperactivation of PKR, a dsRNA sensor. ADAR1 dsRNA binding and catalytic activities were required to fully prevent endogenous RNA from activating PKR. Remarkably, ADAR1 knockout neuronal progenitor cells exhibited MDA5 (dsRNA sensor)-dependent spontaneous interferon production, PKR activation, and cell death. Thus, human ADAR1 regulates sensing of self versus nonself RNA, allowing pathogen detection while avoiding autoinflammation.",2018 Feb 8,Cell. 2018 Feb 8;172(4):811-824.e14. doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2017.12.038.

29419780,Differential Enzymatic Activity of Rat ADAR2 Splicing Variants Is Due to Altered Capability to Interact with RNA in the Deaminase Domain.,"In mammals, adenosine (A) to inosine (I) RNA editing is performed by adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADAR), ADAR1 and ADAR2 enzymes, encoded by mRNAs that might undergo splicing process. In rat, two splicing events produce several isoforms of ADAR2, called ADAR2a, ADAR2b, ADAR2e, and ADAR2f, but only ADAR2a and ADAR2b are translated into an active protein. In particular, they differ for ten amino acids located in the catalytic domain of ADAR2b. Here, we focused on these two isoforms, analyzing the splicing pattern and their different function during rat neuronal maturation. We found an increase of editing levels in cortical neurons overexpressing ADAR2a compared to those overexpressing ADAR2b. These results indicate ADAR2a isoform as the most active one, as reported for the homologous human short variant. Furthermore, we showed that the differential editing activity is not due to a different dimerization of the two isoforms; it seems to be linked to the ten amino acids loop of ADAR2b that might interfere with RNA binding, occupying the space volume in which the RNA should be present in case of binding. These data might shed light on the complexity of ADAR2 regulations.",2018 Feb 8,Genes (Basel). 2018 Feb 8;9(2):79. doi: 10.3390/genes9020079.,"['Filippini A', 'Bonini D', 'Giacopuzzi E', 'La Via L', 'Gangemi F', 'Colombi M', 'Barbon A']",True

29267965,ADAR2/miR-589-3p axis controls glioblastoma cell migration/invasion.,"Recent studies have reported the emerging role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in human cancers. We systematically characterized miRNA expression and editing in the human brain, which displays the highest number of A-to-I RNA editing sites among human tissues, and in de novo glioblastoma brain cancer. We identified 299 miRNAs altered in their expression and 24 miRNAs differently edited in human brain compared to glioblastoma tissues. We focused on the editing site within the miR-589-3p seed. MiR-589-3p is a unique miRNA almost fully edited (∼100%) in normal brain and with a consistent editing decrease in glioblastoma. The edited version of miR-589-3p inhibits glioblastoma cell proliferation, migration and invasion, while the unedited version boosts cell proliferation and motility/invasion, thus being a potential cancer-promoting factor. We demonstrated that the editing of this miRNA is mediated by ADAR2, and retargets miR-589-3p from the tumor-suppressor PCDH9 to ADAM12, which codes for the metalloproteinase 12 promoting glioblastoma invasion. Overall, our study dissects the role of a unique brain-specific editing site within miR-589-3p, with important anticancer features, and highlights the importance of RNA editing as an essential player not only for diversifying the genomic message but also for correcting not-tolerable/critical genomic coding sites.",2018 Feb 28,Nucleic Acids Res. 2018 Feb 28;46(4):2045-2059. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkx1257.,"['Cesarini V', 'Silvestris DA', 'Tassinari V', 'Tomaselli S', 'Alon S', 'Eisenberg E', 'Locatelli F', 'Gallo A']",True
29284691,Adenosine-to-Inosine Editing of MicroRNA-487b Alters Target Gene Selection After Ischemia and Promotes Neovascularization.,"RATIONALE: Adenosine-to-inosine editing of microRNAs has the potential to cause a shift in target site selection. 2'-O-ribose-methylation of adenosine residues, however, has been shown to inhibit adenosine-to-inosine editing. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether angiomiR miR487b is subject to adenosine-to-inosine editing or 2'-O-ribose-methylation during neovascularization. METHODS AND RESULTS: Complementary DNA was prepared from C57BL/6-mice subjected to hindlimb ischemia. Using Sanger sequencing and endonuclease digestion, we identified and validated adenosine-to-inosine editing of the miR487b seed sequence. In the gastrocnemius muscle, pri-miR487b editing increased from 6.7±0.4% before to 11.7±1.6% (P=0.02) 1 day after ischemia. Edited pri-miR487b is processed into a novel microRNA, edited miR487b, which is also upregulated after ischemia. We confirmed editing of miR487b in multiple human primary vascular cell types. Short interfering RNA-mediated knockdown demonstrated that editing is adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 and 2 dependent. Using reverse-transcription at low dNTP concentrations followed by quantitative-PCR, we found that the same adenosine residue is methylated in mice and human primary cells. In the murine gastrocnemius, the estimated methylation fraction increased from 32.8±14% before to 53.6±12% 1 day after ischemia. Short interfering RNA knockdown confirmed that methylation is fibrillarin dependent. Although we could not confirm that methylation directly inhibits editing, we do show that adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 and 2 and fibrillarin negatively influence each other's expression. Using multiple luciferase reporter gene assays, we could demonstrate that editing results in a complete switch of target site selection. In human primary cells, we confirmed the shift in miR487b targeting after editing, resulting in a edited miR487b targetome that is enriched for multiple proangiogenic pathways. Furthermore, overexpression of edited miR487b, but not wild-type miR487b, stimulates angiogenesis in both in vitro and ex vivo assays. CONCLUSIONS: MiR487b is edited in the seed sequence in mice and humans, resulting in a novel, proangiogenic microRNA with a unique targetome. The rate of miR487b editing, as well as 2'-O-ribose-methylation, is increased in murine muscle tissue during postischemic neovascularization.

29364877,Tet2 promotes pathogen infection-induced myelopoiesis through mRNA oxidation.,"Varieties of RNA modification form the epitranscriptome for post-transcriptional regulation. 5-Methylcytosine (5-mC) is a sparse RNA modification in messenger RNA (mRNA) under physiological conditions. The function of RNA 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) oxidized by ten-eleven translocation (Tet) proteins in Drosophila has been revealed more recently. However, the turnover and function of 5-mC in mammalian mRNA have been largely unknown. Tet2 suppresses myeloid malignancies mostly in an enzymatic activity-dependent manner, and is important in resolving inflammatory response in an enzymatic activity-independent way. Myelopoiesis is a common host immune response in acute and chronic infections; however, its epigenetic mechanism needs to be identified. Here we demonstrate that Tet2 promotes infection-induced myelopoiesis in an mRNA oxidation-dependent manner through Adar1-mediated repression of Socs3 expression at the post-transcription level. Tet2 promotes both abdominal sepsis-induced emergency myelopoiesis and parasite-induced mast cell expansion through decreasing mRNA levels of Socs3, a key negative regulator of the JAK-STAT pathway that is critical for cytokine-induced myelopoiesis. Tet2 represses Socs3 expression through Adar1, which binds and destabilizes Socs3 mRNA in a RNA editing-independent manner. For the underlying mechanism of Tet2 regulation at the mRNA level, Tet2 mediates oxidation of 5-mC in mRNA. Tet2 deficiency leads to the transcriptome-wide appearance of methylated cytosines, including ones in the 3' untranslated region of Socs3, which influences double-stranded RNA formation for Adar1 binding, probably through cytosine methylation-specific readers, such as RNA helicases. Our study reveals a previously unknown regulatory role of Tet2 at the epitranscriptomic level, promoting myelopoiesis during infection in the mammalian system by decreasing 5-mCs in mRNAs. Moreover, the inhibitory function of cytosine methylation on double-stranded RNA formation and Adar1 binding in mRNA reveals its new physiological role in the mammalian system.",2018 Feb 1,Nature. 2018 Feb 1;554(7690):123-127. doi: 10.1038/nature25434.

29294013,An Evolutionary Landscape of A-to-I RNA Editome across Metazoan Species.,"Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing is widespread across the kingdom Metazoa. However, for the lack of comprehensive analysis in nonmodel animals, the evolutionary history of A-to-I editing remains largely unexplored. Here, we detect high-confidence editing sites using clustering and conservation strategies based on RNA sequencing data alone, without using single-nucleotide polymorphism information or genome sequencing data from the same sample. We thereby unveil the first evolutionary landscape of A-to-I editing maps across 20 metazoan species (from worm to human), providing unprecedented evidence on how the editing mechanism gradually expands its territory and increases its influence along the history of evolution. Our result revealed that highly clustered and conserved editing sites tended to have a higher editing level and a higher magnitude of the ADAR motif. The ratio of the frequencies of nonsynonymous editing to that of synonymous editing remarkably increased with increasing the conservation level of A-to-I editing. These results thus suggest potentially functional benefit of highly clustered and conserved editing sites. In addition, spatiotemporal dynamics analyses reveal a conserved enrichment of editing and ADAR expression in the central nervous system throughout more than 300 Myr of divergent evolution in complex animals and the comparability of editing patterns between invertebrates and between vertebrates during development. This study provides evolutionary and dynamic aspects of A-to-I editome across metazoan species, expanding this important but understudied class of nongenomically encoded events for comprehensive characterization.",2018 Feb 1,Genome Biol Evol. 2018 Feb 1;10(2):521-537. doi: 10.1093/gbe/evx277.,"['Hung LY', 'Chen YJ', 'Mai TL', 'Chen CY', 'Yang MY', 'Chiang TW', 'Wang YD', 'Chuang TJ']",False

We compared the rates of NCI in large well-characterized samples of HIV-infected (HIV+) Latinos and (non-Latino) Whites, and examined HIV-associated NCI among subgroups of Latinos. METHODS: Participants included English-speaking HIV+ adults assessed at six U.S. medical centers (194 Latinos, 600 Whites). For overall group, age: M=42.65 years, SD=8.93; 86% male; education: M=13.17, SD=2.73; 54% had acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. NCI was assessed with a comprehensive test battery with normative corrections for age, education and gender. Covariates examined included HIV-disease characteristics, comorbidities, and genetic ancestry. RESULTS: Compared with Whites, Latinos had higher rates of global NCI (42% vs. 54%), and domain NCI in executive function, learning, recall, working memory, and processing speed. Latinos also fared worse than Whites on current and historical HIV-disease characteristics, and nadir CD4 partially mediated ethnic differences in NCI. Yet, Latinos continued to have more global NCI [odds ratio (OR)=1.59; 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.13-2.23; p<.01] after adjusting for significant covariates. Higher rates of global NCI were observed with Puerto Rican (n=60; 71%) versus Mexican (n=79, 44%) origin/descent; this disparity persisted in models adjusting for significant covariates (OR=2.40; CI=1.11-5.29; p=.03). CONCLUSIONS: HIV+ Latinos, especially of Puerto Rican (vs. Mexican) origin/descent had increased rates of NCI compared with Whites. Differences in rates of NCI were not completely explained by worse HIV-disease characteristics, neurocognitive comorbidities, or genetic ancestry.

29127211,Mechanistic implications of enhanced editing by a HyperTRIBE RNA-binding protein.,"We previously developed TRIBE, a method for the identification of cell-specific RNA-binding protein targets. TRIBE expresses an RBP of interest fused to the catalytic domain (cd) of the RNA-editing enzyme ADAR and performs adenosine-to-inosine editing on RNA targets of the RBP. However, target identification is limited by the low editing efficiency of the ADARcd. Here we describe HyperTRIBE, which carries a previously characterized hyperactive mutation (E488Q) of the ADARcd. HyperTRIBE identifies dramatically more editing sites, many of which are also edited by TRIBE but at a much lower editing frequency. HyperTRIBE therefore more faithfully recapitulates the known binding specificity of its RBP than TRIBE. In addition, separating RNA binding from the enhanced editing activity of the HyperTRIBE ADAR catalytic domain sheds light on the mechanism of ADARcd editing as well as the enhanced activity of the HyperADARcd.",2018 Feb,RNA. 2018 Feb;24(2):173-182. doi: 10.1261/rna.064691.117.

29185800,Eight Novel Mutations of the ADAR1 Gene in Chinese Patients with Dyschromatosis Symmetrica Hereditaria.,"AIMS: To identify potential novel gene mutations in Chinese patients with dyschromatosis symmetrica hereditaria (DSH). METHODS: We enrolled 8 Chinese patients with familial DSH, 5 Chinese patients with sporadic DSH, and 100 randomly selected healthy individuals in this study. The genome of each participant was extracted from peripheral blood samples. Sanger sequencing of the ADAR1 gene was performed after polymerase chain reaction amplifications. Comparisons between the DNA sequences of the affected individuals and the NCBI database were performed. RESULTS: We detected eight novel heterozygous mutations and five previously reported mutations in the ADAR1 gene in our patients. The novel mutations include c.1934 + 3A>G, c.2749A>G, c.2311insA, c.3233G>A, c.3019 + 1G>T, c.2894C>A, c.1202_1205del, and c.2280C>A. These detected novel mutations are predicted to induce two frame-shift mutations, one nonsense mutation, three missense mutations, and two splice-site mutations. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study expand our knowledge of the range of ADAR1 gene mutations in DSH and will contribute to identifying correlations between the various DSH phenotypes and genotypes.

29280160,When MicroRNAs Meet RNA Editing in Cancer: A Nucleotide Change Can Make a Difference.,"RNA editing is a major post-transcriptional mechanism that changes specific nucleotides at the RNA level. The most common RNA editing type in humans is adenosine (A) to inosine (I) editing, which is mediated by ADAR enzymes. RNA editing events can not only change amino acids in proteins, but also affect the functions of non-coding RNAs such as miRNAs. Recent studies have characterized thousands of miRNA RNA editing events across different cancer types. Importantly, individual cases of miRNA editing have been reported to play a role in cancer development. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of miRNA editing in cancer, and discuss the mechanisms on how miRNA-related editing events modulate the initiation and progression of human cancer.

30587120,Genome-wide analysis of consistently RNA edited sites in human blood reveals interactions with mRNA processing genes and suggests correlations with cell types and biological variables.,"BACKGROUND: A-to-I RNA editing is a co-/post-transcriptional modification catalyzed by ADAR enzymes, that deaminates Adenosines (A) into Inosines (I). Most of known editing events are located within inverted ALU repeats, but they also occur in coding sequences and may alter the function of encoded proteins. RNA editing contributes to generate transcriptomic diversity and it is found altered in cancer, autoimmune and neurological disorders. Emerging evidences indicate that editing process could be influenced by genetic variations, biological and environmental variables. RESULTS: We analyzed RNA editing levels in human blood using RNA-seq data from 459 healthy individuals and identified 2079 sites consistently edited in this tissue. As expected, analysis of gene expression revealed that ADAR is the major contributor to editing on these sites, explaining ~ 13% of observed variability. After removing ADAR effect, we found significant associations for 1122 genes, mainly involved in RNA processing. These genes were significantly enriched in genes encoding proteins interacting with ADARs, including 276 potential ADARs interactors and 9 ADARs direct partners. In addition, our analysis revealed several factors potentially influencing RNA editing in blood, including cell composition, age, Body Mass Index, smoke and alcohol consumption. Finally, we identified genetic loci associated with editing levels, including known ADAR eQTLs and a small region on chromosome 7, containing LOC730338, a lincRNA gene that appears to modulate ADARs mRNA expression. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provides a detailed picture of the most relevant RNA editing events and their variability in human blood, giving interesting insights on potential mechanisms behind this post-transcriptional modification and its regulation in this tissue.",2018 Dec 27,BMC Genomics. 2018 Dec 27;19(1):963. doi: 10.1186/s12864-018-5364-8.,"['Giacopuzzi E', 'Gennarelli M', 'Sacco C', 'Filippini A', 'Mingardi J', 'Magri C', 'Barbon A']",True

30585209,ADAR1 Editing and its Role in Cancer.,"It is well established that somatic mutations and escape of immune disruption are two essential factors in cancer initiation and progression. With an increasing number of second-generation sequencing data, transcriptomic modifications, so called RNA mutations, are emerging as significant forces that drive the transition from normal cell to malignant tumor, as well as providing tumor diversity to escape an immune attack. Editing of adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) in double-stranded RNA, catalyzed by adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs), is one dynamic modification that in a combinatorial manner can give rise to a very diverse transcriptome. Since the cell interprets inosine as guanosine (G), A-to-I editing can result in non-synonymous codon changes in transcripts as well as yield alternative splicing, but also affect targeting and disrupt maturation of microRNAs. ADAR-mediated RNA editing is essential for survival in mammals, however, its dysregulation causes aberrant editing of its targets that may lead to cancer. ADAR1 is commonly overexpressed, for instance in breast, lung, liver and esophageal cancer as well as in chronic myelogenous leukemia, where it promotes cancer progression. It is well known that ADAR1 regulates type I interferon (IFN) and its induced gene signature, which are known to operate as a significant barrier to tumor formation and progression. Adding to the complexity, ADAR1 expression is also regulated by IFN. In this review, we discussed the regulatory mechanisms of ADAR1 during tumorigenesis through aberrant editing of specific substrates. Additionally, we hypothesized that elevated ADAR1 levels play a role in suppressing an innate immunity response in cancer cells.",2018 Dec 25,Genes (Basel). 2018 Dec 25;10(1):12. doi: 10.3390/genes10010012.,"['Xu LD', 'Öhman M']",True

Here, through analysis of genome-scale loss-of-function datasets, we identify adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR or ADAR1) as an essential gene for the survival of a subset of cancer cell lines. ADAR1-dependent cell lines display increased expression of interferon-stimulated genes. Activation of type I interferon signaling in the context of ADAR1 deficiency can induce cell lethality in non-ADAR1-dependent cell lines. ADAR deletion causes activation of the double-stranded RNA sensor, protein kinase R (PKR). Disruption of PKR signaling, through inactivation of PKR or overexpression of either a wildtype or catalytically inactive mutant version of the p150 isoform of ADAR1, partially rescues cell lethality after ADAR1 loss, suggesting that both catalytic and non-enzymatic functions of ADAR1 may contribute to preventing PKR-mediated cell lethality. Together, these data nominate ADAR1 as a potential therapeutic target in a subset of cancers.",2018 Dec 21,Nat Commun. 2018 Dec 21;9(1):5450. doi: 10.1038/s41467-018-07824-4.,"['Gannon HS', 'Zou T', 'Kiessling MK', 'Gao GF', 'Cai D', 'Choi PS', 'Ivan AP', 'Buchumenski I', 'Berger AC', 'Goldstein JT', 'Cherniack AD', 'Vazquez F', 'Tsherniak A', 'Levanon EY', 'Hahn WC', 'Meyerson M']",True
30563560,Enhanced AZIN1 RNA editing and overexpression of its regulatory enzyme ADAR1 are important prognostic biomarkers in gastric cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing is catalyzed by adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADAR) enzymes. Recent evidence suggests that RNA editing of antizyme inhibitor 1 (AZIN1) RNA is emerging as a key epigenetic alteration underlying cancer pathogenesis. METHODS: We evaluated AZIN1 RNA editing levels, and the expression of its regulator, ADAR1, in 280 gastric tissues from 140 patients, using a RNA editing site-specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays. We also analyzed the clinical significance of these results as disease biomarkers in gastric cancer (GC) patients. RESULTS: Both AZIN1 RNA editing levels and ADAR1 expression were significantly elevated in GC tissues compared with matched normal mucosa (P < 0.0001, 0.0008, respectively); and AZIN1 RNA editing was positively correlated with ADAR1 expression. Elevated expression of ADAR1 significantly correlated with poor overall survival (P = 0.034), while hyper-edited AZIN1 emerged as an independent prognostic factor for OS and disease-free survival in GC patients [odds ratio (OR):1.98, 95% CI 1.17-3.35, P = 0.011, OR: 4.55, 95% CI 2.12-9.78, P = 0.0001, respectively]. Increased AZIN1 RNA editing and ADAR1 over-expression were significantly correlated with key clinicopathological factors, such as advanced T stage, presence of lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, and higher TNM stages in GC patients. Logistic regression analysis revealed that hyper-editing status of AZIN1 RNA was an independent risk factor for lymph node metastasis in GC patients [hazard ratio (HR):3.03, 95% CI 1.19-7.71, P = 0.02]. CONCLUSIONS: AZIN1 RNA editing levels may be an important prognostic biomarker in GC patients, and may serve as a key clinical decision-making tool for determining preoperative treatment strategies in GC patients.",2018 Dec 18,J Transl Med. 2018 Dec 18;16(1):366. doi: 10.1186/s12967-018-1740-z.,"['Okugawa Y', 'Toiyama Y', 'Shigeyasu K', 'Yamamoto A', 'Shigemori T', 'Yin C', 'Ichikawa T', 'Yasuda H', 'Fujikawa H', 'Yoshiyama S', 'Hiro J', 'Ohi M', 'Araki T', 'Kusunoki M', 'Goel A']",True
30559217,ADAR2-mediated Q/R editing of GluK2 regulates kainate receptor upscaling in response to suppression of synaptic activity.,"Kainate receptors (KARs) regulate neuronal excitability and network function. Most KARs contain the subunit GluK2 (also known as GRIK2), and the properties of these receptors are determined in part by ADAR2 (also known as ADARB1)-mediated mRNA editing of GluK2, which changes a genomically encoded glutamine residue into an arginine residue (Q/R editing). Suppression of synaptic activity reduces ADAR2-dependent Q/R editing of GluK2 with a consequential increase in GluK2-containing KAR surface expression. However, the mechanism underlying this reduction in GluK2 editing has not been addressed. Here, we show that induction of KAR upscaling, a phenomenon in which surface expression of receptors is increased in response to a chronic decrease in synaptic activity, results in proteasomal degradation of ADAR2, which reduces GluK2 Q/R editing. Because KARs incorporating unedited GluK2(Q) assemble and exit the ER more efficiently, this leads to an upscaling of KAR surface expression. Consistent with this, we demonstrate that partial ADAR2 knockdown phenocopies and occludes KAR upscaling. Moreover, we show that although the AMPA receptor (AMPAR) subunit GluA2 (also known as GRIA2) also undergoes ADAR2-dependent Q/R editing, this process does not mediate AMPAR upscaling. These data demonstrate that activity-dependent regulation of ADAR2 proteostasis and GluK2 Q/R editing are key determinants of KAR, but not AMPAR, trafficking and upscaling.This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.",2018 Dec 17,J Cell Sci. 2018 Dec 17;131(24):jcs222273. doi: 10.1242/jcs.222273.,"['Gurung S', 'Evans AJ', 'Wilkinson KA', 'Henley JM']",False

Based on the analysis of a few proteins, earlier studies reported that rotavirus infection inhibits stress granule (SG) formation and disrupts P bodies (PBs). However, the recent demonstration that rotavirus infection induces cytoplasmic relocalization and colocalization with VMs of several nuclear hnRNPs and AU-rich element-binding proteins (ARE-BPs), which are known components of SGs and PBs, suggested the possibility of rotavirus-induced remodeling of SGs and PBs, prompting us to analyze a large number of the SG and PB components to understand the status of SGs and PBs in rotavirus-infected cells. Here we demonstrate that rotavirus infection induces molecular triage by selective exclusion of a few proteins of SGs (G3BP1 and ZBP1) and PBs (DDX6, EDC4, and Pan3) and sequestration of the remodeled/atypical cellular organelles, containing the majority of their components, in the VM. The punctate SG and PB structures are seen at about 4 h postinfection (hpi), coinciding with the appearance of small VMs, many of which fuse to form mature large VMs with progression of infection. By use of small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown and/or ectopic overexpression, the majority of the SG and PB components, except for ADAR1, were observed to inhibit viral protein expression and virus growth. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that VMs are highly complex supramolecular structures and that rotavirus employs a novel strategy of sequestration in the VM and harnessing of the remodeled cellular RNA recycling bins to promote its growth.IMPORTANCE Rotavirus is known to replicate in specialized virus-induced cytoplasmic inclusion bodies called viroplasms (VMs), but the composition and structure of VMs are not yet understood. Here we demonstrate that rotavirus interferes with normal SG and PB assembly but promotes formation of atypical SG-PB structures by selective exclusion of a few components and employs a novel strategy of sequestration of the remodeled SG-PB granules in the VMs to promote virus growth by modulating their negative influence on virus infection. Rotavirus VMs appear to be complex supramolecular structures formed by the union of the triad of viral replication complexes and remodeled SGs and PBs, as well as other host factors, and designed to promote productive virus infection. These observations have implications for the planning of future research with the aim of understanding the structure of the VM, the mechanism of morphogenesis of the virus, and the detailed roles of host proteins in rotavirus biology.",2018 Dec 15,J Virol. 2018 Nov 27;92(24):e01363-18. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01363-18.

30304469,The C-terminal D/E-rich domain of MBD3 is a putative Z-DNA mimic that competes for Zα DNA-binding activity.,"The Z-DNA binding domain (Zα), derived from the human RNA editing enzyme ADAR1, can induce and stabilize the Z-DNA conformation. However, the biological function of Zα/Z-DNA remains elusive. Herein, we sought to identify proteins associated with Zα to gain insight into the functional network of Zα/Z-DNA. By pull-down, biophysical and biochemical analyses, we identified a novel Zα-interacting protein, MBD3, and revealed that Zα interacted with its C-terminal acidic region, an aspartate (D)/glutamate (E)-rich domain, with high affinity. The D/E-rich domain of MBD3 may act as a DNA mimic to compete with Z-DNA for binding to Zα. Dimerization of MBD3 via intermolecular interaction of the D/E-rich domain and its N-terminal DNA binding domain, a methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD), attenuated the high affinity interaction of Zα and the D/E-rich domain. By monitoring the conformation transition of DNA, we found that Zα could compete with the MBD domain for binding to the Z-DNA forming sequence, but not vice versa. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed the interaction of MBD3 and ADAR1 in vivo. Our findings suggest that the interplay of Zα and MBD3 may regulate the transition of the DNA conformation between B- and Z-DNA and thereby modulate chromatin accessibility, resulting in alterations in gene expression.",2018 Dec 14,Nucleic Acids Res. 2018 Dec 14;46(22):11806-11821. doi: 10.1093/nar/gky933.,"['Lee CH', 'Shih YP', 'Ho MR', 'Wang AH']",False

30551666,A-to-I RNA Editing Affects lncRNAs Expression after Heat Shock.,"Adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing is a highly conserved regulatory process carried out by adenosine-deaminases (ADARs) on double-stranded RNA (dsRNAs). Although a considerable fraction of the transcriptome is edited, the function of most editing sites is unknown. Previous studies indicate changes in A-to-I RNA editing frequencies following exposure to several stress types. However, the overall effect of stress on the expression of ADAR targets is not fully understood. Here, we performed high-throughput RNA sequencing of wild-type and ADAR mutant Caenorhabditis elegans worms after heat-shock to analyze the effect of heat-shock stress on the expression pattern of genes. We found that ADAR regulation following heat-shock does not directly involve heat-shock related genes. Our analysis also revealed that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and pseudogenes, which have a tendency for secondary RNA structures, are enriched among upregulated genes following heat-shock in ADAR mutant worms. The same group of genes is downregulated in ADAR mutant worms under permissive conditions, which is likely, considering that A-to-I editing protects endogenous dsRNA from RNA-interference (RNAi). Therefore, temperature increases may destabilize dsRNA structures and protect them from RNAi degradation, despite the lack of ADAR function. These findings shed new light on the dynamics of gene expression under heat-shock in relation to ADAR function.",2018 Dec 13,Genes (Basel). 2018 Dec 13;9(12):627. doi: 10.3390/genes9120627.,"['Haas R', 'Ganem NS', 'Keshet A', 'Orlov A', 'Fishman A', 'Lamm AT']",True

Proper linking of the catalytic domain of the RNA editing enzyme adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) to an antisense guide RNA can convert specific adenosines (As) to inosines (Is), with the latter recognized as guanosines (Gs) during the translation process. Efforts have been made to engineer the deaminase domain of ADAR1 and the MS2 system to target specific A residues to restore G→A mutations. The target consisted of an ochre (TAA) stop codon, generated from the TGG codon encoding amino acid 58 (Trp) of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). This system had the ability to convert the stop codon (TAA) to a readable codon (TGG), thereby restoring fluorescence in a cellular system, as shown by JuLi fluorescence and LSM confocal microscopy. The specificity of the editing was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism, as the restored EGFP mRNA could be cleaved into fragments of 160 and 100 base pairs. Direct sequencing analysis with both sense and antisense primers showed that the restoration rate was higher for the 5' than for the 3'A. This system may be very useful for treating genetic diseases that result from G→A point mutations.

30361393,ADAR1-mediated RNA editing is required for thymic self-tolerance and inhibition of autoimmunity.,"T cells play a crucial role in the adaptive immune system, and their maturation process is tightly regulated. Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) is the enzyme responsible for adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing in dsRNAs, and loss of ADAR1 activates the innate immune sensing response via melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5), which interprets unedited dsRNA as non-self. Although ADAR1 is highly expressed in the thymus, its role in the adaptive immune system, especially in T cells, remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that T cell-specific deletion of Adar1 in mice causes abnormal thymic T cell maturation including impaired negative selection and autoimmunity such as spontaneous colitis. This is caused by excessive expression of interferon-stimulated genes, which reduces T cell receptor (TCR) signal transduction, due to a failure of RNA editing in ADAR1-deficient thymocytes. Intriguingly, concurrent deletion of MDA5 restores thymocyte maturation and prevents colitis. These findings suggest that prevention of MDA5 sensing of endogenous dsRNA by ADAR1-mediated RNA editing is required for preventing both innate immune responses and T cell-mediated autoimmunity.",2018 Dec,EMBO Rep. 2018 Dec;19(12):e46303. doi: 10.15252/embr.201846303.

The mechanisms driving the activation of the interferon pathway in SLE have been the subject of intense investigation but are still incompletely understood. Transposable elements represent an enormous source of RNA that could potentially stimulate the cell intrinsic RNA-recognition pathway, leading to upregulation of interferons. We used RNA-seq to define transposable element families and subfamilies in three cell types in SLE and found diverse effects on transposable element expression in the three cell types and even within a given family of transposable elements. When potential mechanisms were examined, we found that Hsp90 inhibition could drive increased expression of multiple type of transposable elements. Both direct inhibition and the delivery of a heat shock itself, which redirects heat shock regulators (including Hsp90) off of basal expression promoters and onto heat shock-responsive promoters, led to increased transposable element expression. This effect was amplified by the concurrent delivery of a histone deacetylase inhibitor. We conclude that transposable elements are dysregulated in SLE and there are tissue-specific effects and locus-specific effects. The magnitude of RNAs attributable to transposable elements makes their dysregulation of critical interest in SLE where transposable element RNA complexed with proteins has been shown to drive interferon expression.",2018 Dec,Clin Immunol. 2018 Dec;197:6-18. doi: 10.1016/j.clim.2018.08.011.

30197321,[Biological roles of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA and their relationship with human diseases].,"RNA editing, especially A-to-I RNA editing, is a common post-transcriptional modification in mammals. Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) is a key protein for A-to-I editing, which converts the adenosine group of a double-stranded RNA to creatinine group by deaminating it, resulting in a change of nucleotide sequence. There are 3 types of ADARs (ADAR1, ADAR2, ADAR3) that have been found in recent years. The abnormalities of ADARs are closely related to many human diseases such as viral infections, metabolic diseases, nervous system diseases, and tumors.",2018 Aug 28,Zhong Nan Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban. 2018 Aug 28;43(8):904-911. doi: 10.11817/j.issn.1672-7347.2018.08.014.,"['Chen K', 'Ma R', 'Wang F']",True
29992293,SRSF9 selectively represses ADAR2-mediated editing of brain-specific sites in primates.,"Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing displays diverse spatial patterns across different tissues. However, the human genome encodes only two catalytically active editing enzymes (ADAR1 and ADAR2), suggesting that other regulatory factors help shape the editing landscape. Here, we show that the splicing factor SRSF9 selectively controls the editing of many brain-specific sites in primates. SRSF9 is more lowly expressed in the brain than in non-brain tissues. Gene perturbation experiments and minigene analysis of candidate sites demonstrated that SRSF9 could robustly repress A-to-I editing by ADAR2. We found that SRSF9 biochemically interacted with ADAR2 in the nucleus via its RRM2 domain. This interaction required the presence of the RNA substrate and disrupted the formation of ADAR2 dimers. Transcriptome-wide location analysis and RNA sequencing revealed 1328 editing sites that are controlled directly by SRSF9. This regulon is significantly enriched for brain-specific sites. We further uncovered a novel motif in the ADAR2-dependent SRSF9 binding sites and provided evidence that the splicing factor prevents loss of cell viability by inhibiting ADAR2-mediated editing of genes involved in proteostasis, energy metabolism, the cell cycle and DNA repair. Collectively, our results highlight the importance of SRSF9 as an editing regulator and suggest potential roles for other splicing factors.",2018 Aug 21,Nucleic Acids Res. 2018 Aug 21;46(14):7379-7395. doi: 10.1093/nar/gky615.,"['Shanmugam R', 'Zhang F', 'Srinivasan H', 'Charles Richard JL', 'Liu KI', 'Zhang X', 'Woo CWA', 'Chua ZHM', 'Buschdorf JP', 'Meaney MJ', 'Tan MH']",True
29733375,Tissue-selective restriction of RNA editing of CaV1.3 by splicing factor SRSF9.,"Adenosine DeAminases acting on RNA (ADAR) catalyzes adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) conversion within RNA duplex structures. While A-to-I editing is often dynamically regulated in a spatial-temporal manner, the mechanisms underlying its tissue-selective restriction remain elusive. We have previously reported that transcripts of voltage-gated calcium channel CaV1.3 are subject to brain-selective A-to-I RNA editing by ADAR2. Here, we show that editing of CaV1.3 mRNA is dependent on a 40 bp RNA duplex formed between exon 41 and an evolutionarily conserved editing site complementary sequence (ECS) located within the preceding intron. Heterologous expression of a mouse minigene that contained the ECS, intermediate intronic sequence and exon 41 with ADAR2 yielded robust editing. Interestingly, editing of CaV1.3 was potently inhibited by serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 9 (SRSF9). Mechanistically, the inhibitory effect of SRSF9 required direct RNA interaction. Selective down-regulation of SRSF9 in neurons provides a basis for the neuron-specific editing of CaV1.3 transcripts.",2018 Aug 21,Nucleic Acids Res. 2018 Aug 21;46(14):7323-7338. doi: 10.1093/nar/gky348.,"['Huang H', 'Kapeli K', 'Jin W', 'Wong YP', 'Arumugam TV', 'Koh JH', 'Srimasorn S', 'Mallilankaraman K', 'Chua JJE', 'Yeo GW', 'Soong TW']",True

However, how and to what extent A-to-I editing diversifies and shapes population diversity at the RNA level are largely unknown. Here, we used 462 mRNA-sequencing samples from five populations of the Geuvadis Project and identified 16,518 A-to-I editing sites, with false detection rate of 1.03%. These sites form the landscape of the RNA editome of the human genome. By exploring RNA editing within and between populations, we revealed the geographic restriction of rare editing sites and population-specific patterns of edQTL editing sites. Moreover, we showed that RNA editing can be used to characterize the subtle but substantial diversity between different populations, especially those from different continents. Taken together, our results demonstrated that the nature and structure of populations at the RNA level are illustrated well by RNA editing, which provides insights into the process of how A-to-I editing shapes population diversity at the transcriptomic level. Our work will facilitate the understanding of the landscape of the RNA editome at the population scale and will be helpful for interpreting differences in the distribution and prevalence of disease among individuals and across populations.",2018 Aug 13,Sci Rep. 2018 Aug 13;8(1):12069. doi: 10.1038/s41598-018-30583-7.,"['Ouyang Z', 'Ren C', 'Liu F', 'An G', 'Bo X', 'Shu W']",False
29959219,"RNase H2, mutated in Aicardi-Goutières syndrome, promotes LINE-1 retrotransposition.","Long INterspersed Element class 1 (LINE-1) elements are a type of abundant retrotransposons active in mammalian genomes. An average human genome contains ~100 retrotransposition-competent LINE-1s, whose activity is influenced by the combined action of cellular repressors and activators. TREX1, SAMHD1 and ADAR1 are known LINE-1 repressors and when mutated cause the autoinflammatory disorder Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS). Mutations in RNase H2 are the most common cause of AGS, and its activity was proposed to similarly control LINE-1 retrotransposition. It has therefore been suggested that increased LINE-1 activity may be the cause of aberrant innate immune activation in AGS Here, we establish that, contrary to expectations, RNase H2 is required for efficient LINE-1 retrotransposition. As RNase H1 overexpression partially rescues the defect in RNase H2 null cells, we propose a model in which RNase H2 degrades the LINE-1 RNA after reverse transcription, allowing retrotransposition to be completed. This also explains how LINE-1 elements can retrotranspose efficiently without their own RNase H activity.

As the interferon (IFN) response represents the first line of defense against viral infections in mammals, it is hypothesized that activation of the IFN system is one of the mechanisms enabling bats to co-exist with viruses. We have previously reported induction of type I IFN in a cell line from the common vampire bat, Desmodus rotundus, upon polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) stimulation. To deepen our knowledge on D. rotundus' IFN-I antiviral response, we molecularly characterized three interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), OAS1, PKR and ADAR1, closely implicated in the IFN-I antiviral response, and tested their functionality in our cellular model. We first found that D. rotundus encoded two OAS1 paralogs, OAS1a and OAS1b, and that the functional domains of the four ISGs characterized were highly conserved with those of other mammals. Despite their significant transcription level in the absence of stimulation, the transcription of the four ISGs characterized was enhanced by poly(I:C). In addition, the transcription of OAS1a and OAS1b appears to be differentially regulated.

29637273,The Role of ADAR1 and ADAR2 in the Regulation of miRNA-21 in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis.,"INTRODUCTION: microRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding 1RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression. Recent evidence shows that adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADAR) can edit miRNAs. miRNAs are involved in the development of different diseases, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). In IPF, about 40% of the miRNAs are differentially expressed with respect to controls. Among these miRNAs, miRNA-21 has been found over-expressed in IPF and its targets are anti-fibrosing molecules such as PELI1 and SPRY2. The objective of this study is to determine the role of ADAR1 and 2 on the expression of miRNA-21 in human lung fibroblasts trough quantification of gene expression, protein levels, and overexpression of ADAR1 and 2. METHODS: Six control and six fibrotic primary fibroblast cell cultures were used for RNA extraction, ADAR1, ADAR2, PELI1, SPRY2, miRNA-21, and pri-miRNA-21 expression was measured. Subsequently, two fibrotic fibroblast cultures were used for overexpression of ADAR1 and ADAR2, and they were stimulated with TGFβ1. Real-time PCR and Western blot were performed. RESULTS: ADAR1 is significantly downregulated in IPF fibroblasts; the overexpression of ADAR1 and ADAR2 reestablishes the expression levels of miRNA-21, PELI1, and SPRY2 in fibroblasts of patients with IPF. CONCLUSION: These changes in the processing of miRNAs have great value in pathology diagnosis, including lung diseases, and play an important role in the understanding of molecular mechanisms involved in the development of different pathologies, as well as representing new therapeutic targets.",2018 Aug,Lung. 2018 Aug;196(4):393-400. doi: 10.1007/s00408-018-0115-9.

29692414,A-to-I RNA editing - immune protector and transcriptome diversifier.,"Modifications of RNA affect its function and stability. RNA editing is unique among these modifications because it not only alters the cellular fate of RNA molecules but also alters their sequence relative to the genome. The most common type of RNA editing is A-to-I editing by double-stranded RNA-specific adenosine deaminase (ADAR) enzymes. Recent transcriptomic studies have identified a number of 'recoding' sites at which A-to-I editing results in non-synonymous substitutions in protein-coding sequences. Many of these recoding sites are conserved within (but not usually across) lineages, are under positive selection and have functional and evolutionary importance. However, systematic mapping of the editome across the animal kingdom has revealed that most A-to-I editing sites are located within mobile elements in non-coding parts of the genome. Editing of these non-coding sites is thought to have a critical role in protecting against activation of innate immunity by self-transcripts. Both recoding and non-coding events have implications for genome evolution and, when deregulated, may lead to disease. Finally, ADARs are now being adapted for RNA engineering purposes.",2018 Aug,Nat Rev Genet. 2018 Aug;19(8):473-490. doi: 10.1038/s41576-018-0006-1.,"['Eisenberg E', 'Levanon EY']",True
29906476,ADAR1 affects HCV infection by modulating innate immune response.,"The hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a globally prevalent infectious pathogen. As many as 80% of people infected with HCV do not control the virus and develop a chronic infection. Response to interferon (IFN) therapy is widely variable in chronic HCV infected patients, suggesting that HCV has evolved mechanisms to suppress and evade innate immunity responsible for its control and elimination. Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) is a relevant factor in the regulation of the innate immune response. The loss of ADAR1 RNA-editing activity and the resulting loss of inosine bases in RNA are critical in producing aberrant RLR-mediated innate immune response, mediated by RNA sensors MDA5 and RIG-I. Here, we describe ADAR1 role as a regulator of innate and antiviral immune function in HCV infection, both in vitro and in patients. Polymorphisms within ADAR1 gene were found significantly associated to poor clinical outcome to HCV therapy and advanced liver fibrosis in a cohort of HCV and HIV-1 coinfected patients. Moreover, ADAR1 knockdown in primary macrophages and Huh7 hepatoma cells enhanced IFN and IFN stimulated gene expression and increased HCV replication in vitro. Overall, our results demonstrate that ADAR1 regulates innate immune signaling and is an important contributor to the outcome of the HCV virus-host interaction. ADAR1 is a potential target to boost antiviral immune response in HCV infection.",2018 Aug,Antiviral Res. 2018 Aug;156:116-127. doi: 10.1016/j.antiviral.2018.05.012.

30013039,Identification of RNA-binding protein targets with HyperTRIBE.,"RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) accompany RNA from birth to death, affecting RNA biogenesis and functions. Identifying RBP-RNA interactions is essential to understanding their complex roles in different cellular processes. However, detecting in vivo RNA targets of RBPs, especially in a small number of discrete cells, has been a technically challenging task. We previously developed a novel technique called TRIBE (targets of RNA-binding proteins identified by editing) to overcome this problem. TRIBE expresses a fusion protein consisting of a queried RBP and the catalytic domain of the RNA-editing enzyme ADAR (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA) (ADARcd), which marks target RNA transcripts by converting adenosine to inosine near the RBP binding sites. These marks can be subsequently identified via high-throughput sequencing. In spite of its usefulness, TRIBE is constrained by a low editing efficiency and editing-sequence bias from the ADARcd. Therefore, we developed HyperTRIBE by incorporating a previously characterized hyperactive mutation, E488Q, into the ADARcd. This strategy increases the editing efficiency and reduces sequence bias, which markedly increases the sensitivity of this technique without sacrificing specificity. HyperTRIBE provides a more powerful strategy for identifying RNA targets of RBPs with an easy experimental and computational protocol at low cost, that can be performed not only in flies, but also in mammals. The HyperTRIBE experimental protocol described below can be carried out in cultured Drosophila S2 cells in 1 week, using tools available in a common molecular biology laboratory; the computational analysis requires 3 more days.",2018 Aug,Nat Protoc. 2018 Aug;13(8):1829-1849. doi: 10.1038/s41596-018-0020-y.,"['Rahman R', 'Xu W', 'Jin H', 'Rosbash M']",False

However, little is known about the involvement of editing in other diseases. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multisystemic autoimmune disease characterized by a loss of tolerance for autoantigens from various tissues and the production of multiple autoantibodies. Here, we show that blood samples from individuals with SLE have abnormally high levels of RNA editing, some of which affect proteins and potentially generate novel autoantigens. We suggest that elevated RNA editing, either by ADARs or APOBECs, may be involved in the pathophysiology of SLE, as well as in other autoimmune diseases, by generating or increasing the autoantigen load, a key requisite for the progression of autoimmunity.",2018 Apr 3,Cell Rep. 2018 Apr 3;23(1):50-57. doi: 10.1016/j.celrep.2018.03.036.,"['Roth SH', 'Danan-Gotthold M', 'Ben-Izhak M', 'Rechavi G', 'Cohen CJ', 'Louzoun Y', 'Levanon EY']",True

Given the importance of microRNAs (miRNAs) in regulating cellular plasticity, we performed an unbiased screening and identified the miR-200 family as the most relevant miRNAs downregulated by PKCζ deficiency. The regulation of the intracellular levels of miR-200 by PKCζ is post-transcriptional and involves their secretion in extracellular vesicles. Here, we identified ADAR2 as a direct substrate of PKCζ in CRC cells. Phosphorylation of ADAR2 regulates its editing activity, which is required to maintain miR-200 steady-state levels, suggesting that the PKCζ/ADAR2 axis regulates miR-200 secretion through RNA editing. Loss of this axis results in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and increased liver metastases, which can be inhibited in vivo by blocking miR-200 release.

Using the multiplex microfluidic PCR and deep sequencing technique, we recently showed that exposing adolescent female rats to chronic unpredictable stress before reproduction affects editing in the prefrontal cortex and amygdala of their newborn offspring, particularly at the serotonin receptor 5-HT2c (encoded by Htr2c). Here, we used the same technique to determine whether post-stress, pre-reproductive maternal treatment with fluoxetine (5 mg/kg, 7 days) reverses the effects of stress on editing. We also examined the mRNA expression of ADAR enzymes in these regions, and asked whether social behavior in adult offspring would be altered by maternal exposure to stress and/or fluoxetine. Maternal treatment with fluoxetine altered Htr2c editing in offspring amygdala at birth, enhanced the expression of Htr2c mRNA and RNA editing enzymes in the prefrontal cortex, and reversed the effects of pre-reproductive stress on Htr2c editing in this region. Furthermore, maternal fluoxetine treatment enhanced differences in editing of glutamate receptors between offspring of control and stress-exposed rats, and led to enhanced social preference in adult offspring. Our findings indicate that pre-gestational fluoxetine treatment affects patterns of RNA editing and editing enzyme expression in neonatal offspring brain in a region-specific manner, in interaction with pre-reproductive stress.

30524204,ADAR3 expression is an independent prognostic factor in lower-grade diffuse gliomas and positively correlated with the editing level of GRIA2(Q607R).,"BACKGROUND: RNA editing by adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) converts adenosines to inosines (A-to-I) in RNA, that alters gene expression and generates protein diversity. Dysregulation of A-to-I editing has been found associated with a number of nervous system diseases. However, the role of ADAR3, a brain specific high expression adenosine deaminase, in gliomas has rarely been investigated. In this study we illuminated the clinical significance and molecular features of ADAR3 in patients with glioma. METHODS: 309 glioma samples from Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas were enrolled into this study. In validation sets, 601 glioma samples in TCGA, 410 glioma samples in REMBRANDT and 258 glioma samples in GSE16011 were obtained. Relationships between ADAR3 expression and prognosis-related genomic alteration, outcome and gene ontology analysis were investigated. Moreover, the characteristic of GRIA2(Q607R) editing in gliomas has been investigated. Graphpad Prism 5.0, SPSS 16.0 and R language were used to perform statistical analysis and graphical work. RESULTS: ADAR3 expression was down regulated along with glioma grade progression in CGGA dataset. ADAR3 was characteristically highly expressed in neural subtype and IDH1/2 mutant preference. Moreover, high expression of ADAR3 predicted a better prognosis in lower-grade glioma (LGG) patients and multivariate analysis suggested ADAR3 expression was an independent prognostic indicator. The results of the three other validation datasets showed similar findings. Bioinformatics analyses suggested that ADAR3 may play a role in the malignant transformation of glioma cells by affecting cell proliferation, angiogenesis or cell adhesion. Furthermore, the editing level of GRIA2(Q607R) was significantly correlated with ADAR3 expression. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated the clinical and molecular characterization of ADAR3 in glioma development and progression.

30697154,Ethanol Preference and Drinking Behavior Are Controlled by RNA Editing in the Nucleus Accumbens.,"RNA editing plays critical roles in normal brain function, and alteration of its activity causes various disorders. We previously found that chronic consumption of ethanol was associated with increased levels of RNA editing of serotonin 2C receptor in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). However, it remains unknown whether RNA editing in the NAc modulates alcohol addiction through the brain reward system. To investigate the involvement of NAc RNA editing in alcohol addiction, we generated NAc-specific knockout mice of the double-stranded RNA-specific adenosine deaminase ADAR2 using AAV-GFP/Cre and conducted a battery of behavioral tests including anxiety- and depression-like behaviors. In addition, NAc-specific ADAR2 knockout mice were exposed to ethanol vapor for 20 days, followed by ethanol-drinking and conditioned place preference (CPP) tests. NAc-specific ADAR2 knockout mice showed a significant decrease in locomotor activity in the open field test although they did not develop anxiety- and depression-like behaviors. In addition, the enhancements of ethanol intake and ethanol preference that are usually observed after chronic ethanol vapor exposure were significantly reduced in these mice. These results suggest that ADAR2-mediated RNA editing in the NAc is involved in determination of alcohol preference after chronic alcohol consumption.",2018,Front Behav Neurosci. 2019 Jan 15;12:331. doi: 10.3389/fnbeh.2018.00331. eCollection 2018.,"['Shirahase T', 'Watanabe Y', 'Tsujimura A', 'Kwak S', 'Yamamoto T', 'Kanamura N', 'Tanaka M']",True
30064337,Organ-wide profiling in mouse reveals high editing levels of Filamin B mRNA in the musculoskeletal system.,"Adenosine to inosine RNA editing in protein-coding messenger RNAs (mRNAs) potentially leads to changes in the amino acid composition of the encoded proteins. The mRNAs encoding the ubiquitously expressed actin-crosslinking proteins Filamin A and Filamin B undergo RNA editing leading to a highly conserved glutamine to arginine exchange at the identical position in either protein. Here, by targeted amplicon sequencing we analysed the RNA editing of Filamin B across several mouse tissues during post-natal development. We find highest filamin B editing levels in skeletal muscles, cartilage and bones, tissues where Filamin B function seems most important. Through the analysis of Filamin B editing in mice deficient in either ADAR1 or 2, we identified ADAR2 as the enzyme responsible for Filamin B RNA editing. We show that in neuronal tissues Filamin B editing drops in spliced transcripts indicating regulated maturation of edited transcripts. We show further that the variability of Filamin B editing across several organs correlates with its mRNA expression.",2018,RNA Biol. 2018;15(7):877-885. doi: 10.1080/15476286.2018.1480252.

29470549,Genome-wide identification and analysis of A-to-I RNA editing events in bovine by transcriptome sequencing.,"RNA editing increases the diversity of the transcriptome and proteome. Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing is the predominant type of RNA editing in mammals and it is catalyzed by the adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) family. Here, we used a largescale computational analysis of transcriptomic data from brain, heart, colon, lung, spleen, kidney, testes, skeletal muscle and liver, from three adult animals in order to identify RNA editing sites in bovine. We developed a computational pipeline and used a rigorous strategy to identify novel editing sites from RNA-Seq data in the absence of corresponding DNA sequence information. Our methods take into account sequencing errors, mapping bias, as well as biological replication to reduce the probability of obtaining a false-positive result. We conducted a detailed characterization of sequence and structural features related to novel candidate sites and found 1,600 novel canonical A-to-I editing sites in the nine bovine tissues analyzed. Results show that these sites 1) occur frequently in clusters and short interspersed nuclear elements (SINE) repeats, 2) have a preference for guanines depletion/enrichment in the flanking 5'/3' nucleotide, 3) occur less often in coding sequences than other regions of the genome, and 4) have low evolutionary conservation. Further, we found that a positive correlation exists between expression of ADAR family members and tissue-specific RNA editing. Most of the genes with predicted A-to-I editing in each tissue were significantly enriched in biological terms relevant to the function of the corresponding tissue. Lastly, the results highlight the importance of the RNA editome in nervous system regulation. The present study extends the list of RNA editing sites in bovine and provides pipelines that may be used to investigate the editome in other organisms.",2018,PLoS One. 2018 Feb 22;13(2):e0193316. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0193316. eCollection 2018.,"['Bakhtiarizadeh MR', 'Salehi A', 'Rivera RM']",False
29719497,Adar3 Is Involved in Learning and Memory in Mice.,"The amount of regulatory RNA encoded in the genome and the extent of RNA editing by the post-transcriptional deamination of adenosine to inosine (A-I) have increased with developmental complexity and may be an important factor in the cognitive evolution of animals. The newest member of the A-I editing family of ADAR proteins, the vertebrate-specific ADAR3, is highly expressed in the brain, but its functional significance is unknown. In vitro studies have suggested that ADAR3 acts as a negative regulator of A-I RNA editing but the scope and underlying mechanisms are also unknown. Meta-analysis of published data indicates that mouse Adar3 expression is highest in the hippocampus, thalamus, amygdala, and olfactory region. Consistent with this, we show that mice lacking exon 3 of Adar3 (which encodes two double stranded RNA binding domains) have increased levels of anxiety and deficits in hippocampus-dependent short- and long-term memory formation. RNA sequencing revealed a dysregulation of genes involved in synaptic function in the hippocampi of Adar3-deficient mice. We also show that ADAR3 transiently translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus upon KCl-mediated activation in SH-SY5Y cells.

29790851,RIG-I enhances interferon-α response by promoting antiviral protein expression in patients with chronic hepatitis B.,"BACKGROUND: Interferon (IFN)-α is widely used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection due to the high rate of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) seroconversion. However, IFN-α treatment has a number of side effects. Thus, identification of molecular biomarkers to predict IFN-α therapeutic effect would be useful in the clinic. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I) in prediction of IFN-α curative effect of CHB patients. METHODS: A total of 65 CHB patients treated with pegylated IFN-α weekly for 48 weeks were enrolled. Real-time PCR was performed for detection of RIG-I and IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression. In vitro, the HepG2 cells were transfected with siRNA and levels of RIG-I and anti-HBV proteins were detected by western blot. The P-values were calculated in SPSS 18.0. The statistical significance level was accepted as P<0.05. RESULTS: In this study, we found RIG-I expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was higher in responder than non-responder CHB patients treated with IFN-α therapy. In HBV-transfected HepG2 and Huh7 cells, RIG-I enhanced IFN-α response by promoting anti-HBV protein expression such as double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR), oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS), adenosine deaminase (ADAR1) and Mx protein. Knocking down of RIG-I could downregulate the expression of these proteins. Inhibited RIG-I expression by RIG-I siRNA deceased STAT1 phosphorylation. CONCLUSIONS: Our results revealed RIG-I enhanced IFN-α response by promoting antiviral protein expression via the STAT1 pathway.

29950133,Base-pairing probability in the microRNA stem region affects the binding and editing specificity of human A-to-I editing enzymes ADAR1-p110 and ADAR2.,"Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) catalyze the deamination of adenosine (A) to inosine (I). A-to-I RNA editing targets double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), and increases the complexity of gene regulation by modulating base pairing-dependent processes such as splicing, translation, and microRNA (miRNA)-mediated gene silencing. This study investigates the genome-wide binding preferences of the nuclear constitutive isoforms ADAR1-p110 and ADAR2 on human miRNA species by RNA immunoprecipitation of ADAR-bound small RNAs (RIP-seq). Our results suggest that secondary structure predicted by base-pairing probability in the mainly double-stranded region of a pre-miRNA or mature miRNA duplex may determine ADAR isoform preference for binding distinct subpopulations of miRNAs. Furthermore, we identify 31 unique editing sites with statistical significance, 19 sites of which are novel editing sites. Editing sites are enriched in the seed region responsible for target recognition by miRNAs, and isoform-specific nucleotide motifs in the immediate vicinity and opposite of editing sites are consistent with previous studies, and further reveal that ADAR2 may edit A/C bulges more frequently than ADAR1-p110 in the context of miRNA.",2018,RNA Biol. 2018;15(7):976-989. doi: 10.1080/15476286.2018.1486658.

However, the RNA editing profiles during HCC progression and their clinical correlations remain unclear. METHODS: Multiple tissue samples were collected from an advanced HCC patient. RNA-seq was performed to obtain the RNA editing profiles for each sample. Two RNA editing sites from CDK13 were further validated in 60 HCC patients; and their potential regulatory mechanisms were investigated. RESULTS: In-depth analysis of the RNA-seq data revealed a significant number of editing sites (632-816) in coding regions for each tissue sample, showing branched evolution during tumorigenesis and metastasis. Two editing sites (Q103R and K96R) in CDK13 showed significant over-editing in tumor, and these phenomenon were validated in 60 HCC patients. Furthermore, the clinicopathological analysis revealed that these CDK13 over-editing sites were positively associated with TNM, PVTT and poor prognosis. In addition, the editing level of these sites were significantly correlated with the expression of ADAR1. Loss of function assays further proved that these CDK13 over-editing sites were mediated by ADAR1 in HCC cells.

30057733,Link Prediction Investigation of Dynamic Information Flow in Epilepsy.,"As a brain disorder, epilepsy is characterized with abnormal hypersynchronous neural firings. It is known that seizures initiate and propagate in different brain regions. Long-term intracranial multichannel electroencephalography (EEG) reflects broadband ictal activity under seizure occurrence. Network-based techniques are efficient in discovering brain dynamics and offering finger-print features for specific individuals. In this study, we adopt link prediction for proposing a novel workflow aiming to quantify seizure dynamics and uncover pathological mechanisms of epilepsy. A dataset of EEG signals was enrolled that recorded from 8 patients with 3 different types of pharmocoresistant focal epilepsy. Weighted networks are obtained from phase locking value (PLV) in subband EEG oscillations. Common neighbor (CN), resource allocation (RA), Adamic-Adar (AA), and Sorenson algorithms are brought in for link prediction performance comparison. Results demonstrate that RA outperforms its rivals. Similarity, matrix was produced from the RA technique performing on EEG networks later.

30071181,"RNA editing in bacteria: occurrence, regulation and significance.","DNA harbors the blueprint for life. However, the instructions stored in the DNA could be altered at the RNA level before they are executed. One of these processes is RNA editing, which was shown to modify RNA sequences in many organisms. The most abundant modification is the deamination of adenosine (A) into inosine (I). In turn, inosine can be identified as a guanosine (G) by the ribosome and other cellular machineries such as reverse transcriptase. In multicellular organisms, enzymes from the ADAR (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA) family mediate RNA editing in mRNA, whereas enzymes from the ADAT family mediate A-to-I editing on tRNAs. In bacteria however, until recently, only one editing site was described, in tRNA(Arg), but never in mRNA. The tRNA site was shown to be modified by tadA (tRNA specific adenosine deaminase) which is believed to be the ancestral enzyme for the RNA editing family of enzymes. In our recent work, we have shown for the first time, editing on multiple sites in bacterial mRNAs and identified tadA as the enzyme responsible for this editing activity.

Emerging evidence indicated that under hypoxia condition, such as tumor microenvironment, ADAR1 level was increased. Interestingly, we found FGFR2 was also increased under hypoxia stress. The purpose of this study was to investigate the regulation mechanism of ADAR1 and the potential role of ADAR1-FGFR2 axis in cell proliferation and apoptosis. METHODS: Using human umbilical vein endothelial cells as cellular model, we explored the function of ADAR1 in regulating cell survival. RESULTS: We found manipulation of FGFR2 activity could override the cellular effect of ADAR1, suggesting FGFR2 could be a potential effector of ADAR1.

30619092,The Role of RNA Editing in Cancer Development and Metabolic Disorders.,"Numerous human diseases arise from alterations of genetic information, most notably DNA mutations. Thought to be merely the intermediate between DNA and protein, changes in RNA sequence were an afterthought until the discovery of RNA editing 30 years ago. RNA editing alters RNA sequence without altering the sequence or integrity of genomic DNA. The most common RNA editing events are A-to-I changes mediated by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR), and C-to-U editing mediated by apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide 1 (APOBEC1). Both A-to-I and C-to-U editing were first identified in the context of embryonic development and physiological homeostasis. The role of RNA editing in human disease has only recently started to be understood. In this review, the impact of RNA editing on the development of cancer and metabolic disorders will be examined. Distinctive functions of each RNA editase that regulate either A-to-I or C-to-U editing will be highlighted in addition to pointing out important regulatory mechanisms governing these processes. The potential of developing novel therapeutic approaches through intervention of RNA editing will be explored. As the role of RNA editing in human disease is elucidated, the clinical utility of RNA editing targeted therapies will be needed.

28874170,Protein recoding by ADAR1-mediated RNA editing is not essential for normal development and homeostasis.,"BACKGROUND: Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing of dsRNA by ADAR proteins is a pervasive epitranscriptome feature. Tens of thousands of A-to-I editing events are defined in the mouse, yet the functional impact of most is unknown. Editing causing protein recoding is the essential function of ADAR2, but an essential role for recoding by ADAR1 has not been demonstrated. ADAR1 has been proposed to have editing-dependent and editing-independent functions. The relative contribution of these in vivo has not been clearly defined. A critical function of ADAR1 is editing of endogenous RNA to prevent activation of the dsRNA sensor MDA5 (Ifih1). Outside of this, how ADAR1 editing contributes to normal development and homeostasis is uncertain. RESULTS: We describe the consequences of ADAR1 editing deficiency on murine homeostasis. Adar1 (E861A/E861A) Ifih1 (-/-) mice are strikingly normal, including their lifespan. There is a mild, non-pathogenic innate immune activation signature in the Adar1 (E861A/E861A) Ifih1 (-/-) mice. Assessing A-to-I editing across adult tissues demonstrates that outside of the brain, ADAR1 performs the majority of editing and that ADAR2 cannot compensate in its absence. Direct comparison of the Adar1 (-/-) and Adar1 (E861A/E861A) alleles demonstrates a high degree of concordance on both Ifih1 (+/+) and Ifih1 (-/-) backgrounds, suggesting no substantial contribution from ADAR1 editing-independent functions. CONCLUSIONS: These analyses demonstrate that the lifetime absence of ADAR1-editing is well tolerated in the absence of MDA5. We conclude that protein recoding arising from ADAR1-mediated editing is not essential for organismal homeostasis. Additionally, the phenotypes associated with loss of ADAR1 are the result of RNA editing and MDA5-dependent functions.",2017 Sep 5,Genome Biol. 2017 Sep 5;18(1):166. doi: 10.1186/s13059-017-1301-4.,"['Heraud-Farlow JE', 'Chalk AM', 'Linder SE', 'Li Q', 'Taylor S', 'White JM', 'Pang L', 'Liddicoat BJ', 'Gupte A', 'Li JB', 'Walkley CR']",True

At the time of this discovery there was much speculation concerning the mechanism of base modification RNA editing which has been rekindled by the discovery of multiple C to U RNA editing events in the 3' UTRs of mRNAs and the finding that other members of the APOBEC family while able to bind RNA, have the biological function of being DNA mutating enzymes. Current research is addressing the mechanism for these nucleotide modification events that appear not to adhere to the mooring sequence-dependent model for APOBEC1 involving the assembly of a multi protein containing editosome.

28346055,A to I editing in disease is not fake news.,"Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) are zinc-containing enzymes that deaminate adenosine bases to inosines within dsRNA regions in transcripts. In short, structured dsRNA hairpins individual adenosine bases may be targeted specifically and edited with up to one hundred percent efficiency, leading to the production of alternative protein variants. However, the majority of editing events occur within longer stretches of dsRNA formed by pairing of repetitive sequences. Here, many different adenosine bases are potential targets but editing efficiency is usually much lower. Recent work shows that ADAR-mediated RNA editing is also required to prevent aberrant activation of antiviral innate immune sensors that detect viral dsRNA in the cytoplasm. Missense mutations in the ADAR1 RNA editing enzyme cause a fatal auto-inflammatory disease, Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS) in affected children. In addition RNA editing by ADARs has been observed to increase in many cancers and also can contribute to vascular disease. Thus the role of RNA editing in the progression of various diseases can no longer be ignored. The ability of ADARs to alter the sequence of RNAs has also been used to artificially target model RNAs in vitro and in cells for RNA editing. Potentially this approach may be used to repair genetic defects and to alter genetic information at the RNA level.

Intersecting the neural editome with adr-2 associated gene expression changes, revealed an edited mRNA, clec-41, whose neural expression is dependent on deamination.

28928239,The RNA-editing enzyme ADAR promotes lung adenocarcinoma migration and invasion by stabilizing FAK.,"Large-scale, genome-wide studies report that RNA binding proteins are altered in cancers, but it is unclear how these proteins control tumor progression. We found that the RNA-editing protein ADAR (adenosine deaminase acting on double-stranded RNA) acted as a facilitator of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) progression through its ability to stabilize transcripts encoding focal adhesion kinase (FAK). In samples from 802 stage I LUAD patients, increased abundance of ADAR at both the mRNA and protein level correlated with tumor recurrence. Knocking down ADAR in LUAD cells suppressed their mesenchymal properties, migration, and invasion in culture. Analysis of gene expression patterns in LUAD cells identified ADAR-associated enrichment of a subset of genes involved in cell migration pathways; among these, FAK is the most notable gene whose expression was increased in the presence of ADAR. Molecular analyses revealed that ADAR posttranscriptionally increased FAK protein abundance by binding to the FAK transcript and editing a specific intronic site that resulted in the increased stabilization of FAK mRNA. Pharmacological inhibition of FAK blocked ADAR-induced invasiveness of LUAD cells, suggesting a potential therapeutic application for LUAD that has a high abundance of ADAR.",2017 Sep 19,Sci Signal. 2017 Sep 19;10(497):eaah3941. doi: 10.1126/scisignal.aah3941.,"['Amin EM', 'Liu Y', 'Deng S', 'Tan KS', 'Chudgar N', 'Mayo MW', 'Sanchez-Vega F', 'Adusumilli PS', 'Schultz N', 'Jones DR']",True

In this study, we profiled the A-to-I editing landscape and characterized its functional and adaptive properties in the model filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa A total of 40,677 A-to-I editing sites were identified, and approximately half of them displayed stage-specific editing or editing levels at different sexual stages. RNA-sequencing analysis with the Δstc-1 and Δsad-1 mutants confirmed A-to-I editing occurred before ascus development but became more prevalent during ascosporogenesis. Besides fungal-specific sequence and secondary structure preference, 63.5% of A-to-I editing sites were in the coding regions and 81.3% of them resulted in nonsynonymous recoding, resulting in a significant increase in the proteome complexity. Many genes involved in RNA silencing, DNA methylation, and histone modifications had extensive recoding, including sad-1, sms-3, qde-1, and dim-2. Fifty pseudogenes harbor premature stop codons that require A-to-I editing to encode full-length proteins. Unlike in humans, nonsynonymous editing events in N. crassa are generally beneficial and favored by positive selection. Almost half of the nonsynonymous editing sites in N. crassa are conserved and edited in Neurospora tetrasperma Furthermore, hundreds of them are conserved in F. graminearum and had higher editing levels. Two unknown genes with editing sites conserved between Neurospora and Fusarium were experimentally shown to be important for ascosporogenesis.

Furthermore, ADAR1 negatively regulates interaction of Ctn RNA with RNA-destabilizing proteins. We also show that breast cancer (BC) cells display elevated ADAR1 but not ADAR2 levels, compared to nontumourigenic cells. Additionally, BC patients with elevated levels of ADAR1 show low survival.

28913566,ADAR RNA editing in human disease; more to it than meets the I.,"We review the structures and functions of ADARs and their involvements in human diseases. ADAR1 is widely expressed, particularly in the myeloid component of the blood system, and plays a prominent role in promiscuous editing of long dsRNA. Missense mutations that change ADAR1 residues and reduce RNA editing activity cause Aicardi-Goutières Syndrome, a childhood encephalitis and interferonopathy that mimics viral infection and resembles an extreme form of Systemic Lupus Erythmatosus (SLE). In Adar1 mouse mutant models aberrant interferon expression is prevented by eliminating interferon activation signaling from cytoplasmic dsRNA sensors, indicating that unedited cytoplasmic dsRNA drives the immune induction. On the other hand, upregulation of ADAR1 with widespread promiscuous RNA editing is a prominent feature of many cancers and particular site-specific RNA editing events are also affected. ADAR2 is most highly expressed in brain and is primarily required for site-specific editing of CNS transcripts; recent findings indicate that ADAR2 editing is regulated by neuronal excitation for synaptic scaling of glutamate receptors. ADAR2 is also linked to the circadian clock and to sleep. Mutations in ADAR2 could contribute to excitability syndromes such as epilepsy, to seizures, to diseases involving neuronal plasticity defects, such as autism and Fragile-X Syndrome, to neurodegenerations such as ALS, or to astrocytomas or glioblastomas in which reduced ADAR2 activity is required for oncogenic cell behavior. The range of human disease associated with ADAR1 mutations may extend further to include other inflammatory conditions while ADAR2 mutations may affect psychiatric conditions.",2017 Sep,Hum Genet. 2017 Sep;136(9):1265-1278. doi: 10.1007/s00439-017-1837-0.

29078406,Site-directed RNA repair of endogenous Mecp2 RNA in neurons.,"Rett syndrome (RTT) is a debilitating neurological disorder caused by mutations in the gene encoding the transcription factor Methyl CpG Binding Protein 2 (MECP2). A distinct disorder results from MECP2 gene duplication, suggesting that therapeutic approaches must restore close to normal levels of MECP2. Here, we apply the approach of site-directed RNA editing to repair, at the mRNA level, a disease-causing guanosine to adenosine (G > A) mutation in the mouse MeCP2 DNA binding domain. To mediate repair, we exploit the catalytic domain of Adenosine Deaminase Acting on RNA (ADAR2) that deaminates A to inosine (I) residues that are subsequently translated as G. We fuse the ADAR2 domain, tagged with a nuclear localization signal, to an RNA binding peptide from bacteriophage lambda. In cultured neurons from mice that harbor an RTT patient G > A mutation and express engineered ADAR2, along with an appropriate RNA guide to target the enzyme, 72% of Mecp2 mRNA is repaired. Levels of MeCP2 protein are also increased significantly. Importantly, as in wild-type neurons, the repaired MeCP2 protein is enriched in heterochromatic foci, reflecting restoration of normal MeCP2 binding to methylated DNA. This successful use of site-directed RNA editing to repair an endogenous mRNA and restore protein function opens the door to future in vivo applications to treat RTT and other diseases.",2017 Oct 31,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2017 Oct 31;114(44):E9395-E9402. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1715320114.

The functional requirement and regulatory landscape for the majority of A-to-I editing events are, at present, uncertain. Recent studies have identified key in vivo functions of ADAR enzymes, informing our understanding of the biological importance of A-to-I editing.

29061182,Editing inducer elements increases A-to-I editing efficiency in the mammalian transcriptome.,"BACKGROUND: Adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing has been shown to be an essential event that plays a significant role in neuronal function, as well as innate immunity, in mammals. It requires a structure that is largely double-stranded for catalysis but little is known about what determines editing efficiency and specificity in vivo. We have previously shown that some editing sites require adjacent long stem loop structures acting as editing inducer elements (EIEs) for efficient editing. RESULTS: The glutamate receptor subunit A2 is edited at the Q/R site in almost 100% of all transcripts. We show that efficient editing at the Q/R site requires an EIE in the downstream intron, separated by an internal loop. Also, other efficiently edited sites are flanked by conserved, highly structured EIEs and we propose that this is a general requisite for efficient editing, while sites with low levels of editing lack EIEs. This phenomenon is not limited to mRNA, as non-coding primary miRNAs also use EIEs to recruit ADAR to specific sites. CONCLUSIONS: We propose a model where two regions of dsRNA are required for efficient editing: first, an RNA stem that recruits ADAR and increases the local concentration of the enzyme, then a shorter, less stable duplex that is ideal for efficient and specific catalysis. This discovery changes the way we define and determine a substrate for A-to-I editing. This will be important in the discovery of novel editing sites, as well as explaining cases of altered editing in relation to disease.",2017 Oct 23,Genome Biol. 2017 Oct 23;18(1):195. doi: 10.1186/s13059-017-1324-x.,"['Daniel C', 'Widmark A', 'Rigardt D', 'Öhman M']",True
28969707,Massive A-to-I RNA editing is common across the Metazoa and correlates with dsRNA abundance.,"BACKGROUND: Adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing is a post-transcriptional modification catalyzed by the ADAR (adenosine deaminase that acts on RNA) enzymes, which are ubiquitously expressed among metazoans. Technical requirements have limited systematic mapping of editing sites to a small number of organisms. Thus, the extent of editing across the metazoan lineage is largely unknown. RESULTS: Here, we apply a computational procedure to search for RNA-sequencing reads containing clusters of editing sites in 21 diverse organisms. Clusters of editing sites are abundant in repetitive genomic regions that putatively form double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) structures and are rarely seen in coding regions. The method reveals a considerable variation in hyper-editing levels across species, which is partly explained by differences in the potential of sequences to form dsRNA structures and the variability of ADAR proteins. Several commonly used model animals exhibit low editing levels and editing levels in primates is not exceptionally high, as previously suggested. CONCLUSIONS: Editing by ADARs is highly prevalent across the Metazoa, mostly targeting dsRNA structures formed by genomic repeats. The degree to which the transcriptome of a given species undergoes hyper-editing is governed by the repertoire of repeats in the underlying genome. The strong association of RNA editing with the long dsRNA regions originating from non-coding repetitive elements is contrasted by the almost non-existing signal seen in coding regions. Hyper-edited regions are rarely expressed in a non-edited form. These results support the notion that the main role of ADAR is to suppress the cellular response to endogenous dsRNA structures.",2017 Oct 2,Genome Biol. 2017 Oct 2;18(1):185. doi: 10.1186/s13059-017-1315-y.,"['Porath HT', 'Knisbacher BA', 'Eisenberg E', 'Levanon EY']",True
29042669,RNA editing by ADAR1 regulates innate and antiviral immune functions in primary macrophages.,"ADAR1-dependent A-to-I editing has recently been recognized as a key process for marking dsRNA as self, therefore, preventing innate immune activation and affecting the development and resolution of immune-mediated diseases and infections. Here, we have determined the role of ADAR1 as a regulator of innate immune activation and modifier of viral susceptibility in primary myeloid and lymphoid cells. We show that ADAR1 knockdown significantly enhanced interferon, cytokine and chemokine production in primary macrophages that function as antiviral paracrine factors, rendering them resistant to HIV-1 infection. ADAR1 knockdown induced deregulation of the RLRs-MAVS signaling pathway, by increasing MDA5, RIG-I, IRF7 and phospho-STAT1 expression, an effect that was partially rescued by pharmacological blockade of the pathway. In summary, our results demonstrate a role of ADAR1 in regulating innate immune function in primary macrophages, suggesting that macrophages may play an essential role in disease associated to ADAR1 dysfunction. We also show that viral inhibition is exclusively dependent on innate immune activation consequence of ADAR1 knockdown, pointing towards ADAR1 as a potential target to boost antiviral immune response.",2017 Oct 17,Sci Rep. 2017 Oct 17;7(1):13339. doi: 10.1038/s41598-017-13580-0.,"['Pujantell M', 'Riveira-Muñoz E', 'Badia R', 'Castellví M', 'Garcia-Vidal E', 'Sirera G', 'Puig T', 'Ramirez C', 'Clotet B', 'Esté JA', 'Ballana E']",False
28985428,An RNA editing/dsRNA binding-independent gene regulatory mechanism of ADARs and its clinical implication in cancer.,"Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing, catalyzed by Adenosine DeAminases acting on double-stranded RNA(dsRNA) (ADAR), occurs predominantly in the 3' untranslated regions (3'UTRs) of spliced mRNA. Here we uncover an unanticipated link between ADARs (ADAR1 and ADAR2) and the expression of target genes undergoing extensive 3'UTR editing. Using METTL7A (Methyltransferase Like 7A), a novel tumor suppressor gene with multiple editing sites at its 3'UTR, we demonstrate that its expression could be repressed by ADARs beyond their RNA editing and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) binding functions. ADARs interact with Dicer to augment the processing of pre-miR-27a to mature miR-27a. Consequently, mature miR-27a targets the METTL7A 3'UTR to repress its expression level. In sum, our study unveils that the extensive 3'UTR editing of METTL7A is merely a footprint of ADAR binding, and there are a subset of target genes that are equivalently regulated by ADAR1 and ADAR2 through their non-canonical RNA editing and dsRNA binding-independent functions, albeit maybe less common. The functional significance of ADARs is much more diverse than previously appreciated and this gene regulatory function of ADARs is most likely to be of high biological importance beyond the best-studied editing function.

29022589,Dynamic landscape and regulation of RNA editing in mammals.,"Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing is a conserved post-transcriptional mechanism mediated by ADAR enzymes that diversifies the transcriptome by altering selected nucleotides in RNA molecules. Although many editing sites have recently been discovered, the extent to which most sites are edited and how the editing is regulated in different biological contexts are not fully understood. Here we report dynamic spatiotemporal patterns and new regulators of RNA editing, discovered through an extensive profiling of A-to-I RNA editing in 8,551 human samples (representing 53 body sites from 552 individuals) from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project and in hundreds of other primate and mouse samples. We show that editing levels in non-repetitive coding regions vary more between tissues than editing levels in repetitive regions. Globally, ADAR1 is the primary editor of repetitive sites and ADAR2 is the primary editor of non-repetitive coding sites, whereas the catalytically inactive ADAR3 predominantly acts as an inhibitor of editing. Cross-species analysis of RNA editing in several tissues revealed that species, rather than tissue type, is the primary determinant of editing levels, suggesting stronger cis-directed regulation of RNA editing for most sites, although the small set of conserved coding sites is under stronger trans-regulation. In addition, we curated an extensive set of ADAR1 and ADAR2 targets and showed that many editing sites display distinct tissue-specific regulation by the ADAR enzymes in vivo. Further analysis of the GTEx data revealed several potential regulators of editing, such as AIMP2, which reduces editing in muscles by enhancing the degradation of the ADAR proteins.

Our aim was to analyze the association of polymorphisms within this gene with the severity of liver disease in European HIV/HCV-coinfected patients. We performed a cross-sectional study in 220 patients that underwent a liver biopsy. Five SNPs in the ADAR1 gene (rs1127326, rs1127317, rs1127314, rs1127313, rs2229857) were genotyped by GoldenGate assay. The outcome variables were fibrosis stage and necroinflammatory activity grade by METAVIR-score, aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index (APRI), FIB-4 index, and fibrosis progression rate (FPR). In multivariate analysis, fibrosis progression rate (FPR) (aAMRs = 0.97) decreased in a dose-dependent manner with the presence of rs2229857_T, rs1127313_G, rs1127314_G and rs1127317_G; while rs1127326_T allele had only significant associations with FIB-4 (aAMRs ≤ 0.63) and FPR (aAMRs ≤ 0.97). Moreover, carriers of rs2229857_T, rs1127314_G, rs1127317_G, and rs1127326_T alleles were protected against advanced fibrosis (F ≥ 3) (adjusted ORs (aORs) ≤ 0.44), APRI ≥ 1.5 (aORs ≤ 0.33), and FPR ≥ 0.075 (aORs ≤ 0.45). rs1127313_G carriers showed lower odds of having F ≥ 3 (aORs = 0.39), FIB4 ≥ 3.25 (aOR = 0.22) and FPR ≥ 0.075 (aORs = 0.44).

Although microRNAs modulate the outcome of several viral infections, their contribution to DENV replication is poorly understood. METHODS AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We investigated the microRNA expression profile of primary human macrophages challenged with DENV and deciphered the contribution of microRNAs to infection. To this end, human primary macrophages were challenged with GFP-expressing DENV and sorted to differentiate between truly infected cells (DENV-positive) and DENV-exposed but non-infected cells (DENV-negative cells). The miRNAome was determined by small RNA-Seq analysis and the effect of differentially expressed microRNAs on DENV yield was examined. Five microRNAs were differentially expressed in human macrophages challenged with DENV. Of these, miR-3614-5p was found upregulated in DENV-negative cells and its overexpression reduced DENV infectivity. The cellular targets of miR-3614-5p were identified by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry and western blot. Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) was identified as one of the targets of miR-3614-5p and was shown to promote DENV infectivity at early time points post-infection. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Overall, miRNAs appear to play a limited role in DENV replication in primary human macrophages. The miRNAs that were found upregulated in DENV-infected cells did not control the production of infectious virus particles.

28640667,Restricting retrotransposons: ADAR1 is another guardian of the human genome.,"ADAR1 is an enzyme that belongs to the Adenosine Deaminases Acting on RNA (ADARs) family. These enzymes deaminate adenosines to inosines (RNA editing A-to-I) within double-stranded RNA regions in transcripts. Since inosines are recognized as guanosines by the cellular machinery, RNA editing mediated by ADARs can either lead to the formation of an altered protein (recoding) or affect different aspects of RNA metabolism. Recently, a proteomic analysis led to the identification of novel ADAR1-associated factors and found that a good fraction of them is shared with the Long Interspersed Element 1 (LINE-1 or L1) ribonucleoparticles (RNPs).

Recently, an unexpected function of FMRP in modulating the activity of Adenosine Deaminase Acting on RNA (ADAR) enzymes has been reported both in Drosophila and Zebrafish. ADARs are RNA-binding proteins that increase transcriptional complexity through a post-transcriptional mechanism called RNA editing. To evaluate the ADAR2-FMRP interaction in mammals we analyzed several RNA editing re-coding sites in the fmr1 knockout (KO) mice. Ex vivo and in vitro analysis revealed that absence of FMRP leads to an increase in the editing levels of brain specific mRNAs, indicating that FMRP might act as an inhibitor of editing activity. Proximity Ligation Assay (PLA) in mouse primary cortical neurons and in non-neuronal cells revealed that ADAR2 and FMRP co-localize in the nucleus. The ADAR2-FMRP co-localization was further observed by double-immunogold Electron Microscopy (EM) in the hippocampus. Moreover, ADAR2-FMRP interaction appeared to be RNA independent.

This transition facilitates the binding of d(GAC)(7)·d(GAC)(7) with the Zα-binding domain of human adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1, hZα(ADAR1)), as confirmed by CD, NMR, and microscale thermophoresis studies. The CD results indicated that hZα(ADAR1) recognizes the zigzag backbone of d(GAC)(7)·d(GAC)(7) at the B-Z junction and subsequently converts it into Z-DNA via the so-called passive mechanism. Molecular dynamics simulations carried out for the modeled hZα(ADAR1)-d(GAC)(6)d(GAC)(6) complex confirmed the retention of previously reported important interactions between the two molecules. These findings suggest that hZα(ADAR1) binding with the GAC hairpin stem in COMP can lead to a non-genetic, RNA editing-mediated substitution in COMP that may then play a crucial role in the development of pseudoachondroplasia.",2017 Nov 17,J Biol Chem. 2017 Nov 17;292(46):18732-18746. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M117.796235.

29144509,Circular RNA expression is suppressed by androgen receptor (AR)-regulated adenosine deaminase that acts on RNA (ADAR1) in human hepatocellular carcinoma.,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a heterogeneous malignancy as a result of complex genetic and epigenetic alterations. HCC is characterized by a clear gender disparity for which there is lack of a clear mechanistic understanding. Androgen receptor (AR) is thought to be critical for such bias. Meanwhile, the potential function of circular RNA (circRNA), regulated by RNA editing enzyme, remained largely unknown in malignancy till now. By utilizing circRNA microarray survey coupled with in vitro analysis, we analyzed the influence of AR on circRNA expression in HCC. Our results indicated that AR could suppress circRNA expression by upregulating ADAR1 p110. Such effect is because AR served as a transcriptional activator of ADAR1 promoter. More significantly, data collected from our center strongly suggest that ADAR1 expression can effectively predict HCC patients' prognosis and an abnormal overexpression of ADAR1 is positively correlated with AR in HCC. In addition, we found CircARSP91 (hsa_circ_0085154), one of the circRNAs downregulated by AR in an ADAR1-dependent manner, could inhibit HCC tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo. These findings highlight the fact that AR as a contributing factor for gender disparity in HCC can cause complex consequences though regulation of circRNA expression. Better understanding of the roles of circRNA during HCC initiation and progression will provide a novel angle to develop potential HCC therapies.",2017 Nov 16,Cell Death Dis. 2017 Nov 16;8(11):e3171. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2017.556.,"['Shi L', 'Yan P', 'Liang Y', 'Sun Y', 'Shen J', 'Zhou S', 'Lin H', 'Liang X', 'Cai X']",True

RNA editing is vital for preventing abnormal activation of cytosolic nucleic acid sensing pathways by self-double-stranded RNAs. Here we determine, by parallel analysis of RNA secondary structure sequencing (PARS-seq), the global RNA secondary structure changes in ADAR1 deficient cells. Surprisingly, ADAR1 silencing resulted in a lower global double-stranded to single-stranded RNA ratio, suggesting that A-to-I editing can stabilize a large subset of imperfect RNA duplexes. The duplexes destabilized by editing are composed of vastly complementary inverted Alus found in untranslated regions of genes performing vital biological processes, including housekeeping functions and type-I interferon responses. They are predominantly cytoplasmic and generally demonstrate higher ribosomal occupancy.

28960389,The Other Face of an Editor: ADAR1 Functions in Editing-Independent Ways.,"The RNA editing enzyme ADAR1 seemingly has more functions besides RNA editing. Mouse models lacking ADAR1 and sensors of foreign RNA show that RNA editing by ADAR1 plays a crucial role in the innate immune response. Still, RNA editing alone cannot explain all observed phenotypes. Thus, additional roles for ADAR1 must exist. Binding of ADAR1 to RNA is independent of its RNA editing function. Thus, ADAR1 may compete with other RNA-binding proteins. A very recent manuscript elaborates on this and reports competition of ADAR1 with STAUFEN1, thereby modulating RNA-degradation. ADAR1 is also known to recruit proteins such as DROSHA to nascent transcripts. Still, many open questions remain. For instance, the biological role of the Z-DNA binding domains in ADAR1 is not defined. Moreover, the impact of ADAR1 on the RNA-folding landscape is unclear. In sum, moonlighting functions of ADAR1 may be manifold and have a great impact on the transcriptome.",2017 Nov,Bioessays. 2017 Nov;39(11). doi: 10.1002/bies.201700129.

28486975,Evidence for transcriptome-wide RNA editing among Sus scrofa PRE-1 SINE elements.,"BACKGROUND: RNA editing by ADAR (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA) proteins is a form of transcriptional regulation that is widespread among humans and other primates. Based on high-throughput scans used to identify putative RNA editing sites, ADAR appears to catalyze a substantial number of adenosine to inosine transitions within repetitive regions of the primate transcriptome, thereby dramatically enhancing genetic variation beyond what is encoded in the genome. RESULTS: Here, we demonstrate the editing potential of the pig transcriptome by utilizing DNA and RNA sequence data from the same pig. We identified a total of 8550 mismatches between DNA and RNA sequences across three tissues, with 75% of these exhibiting an A-to-G (DNA to RNA) discrepancy, indicative of a canonical ADAR-catalyzed RNA editing event. When we consider only mismatches within repetitive regions of the genome, the A-to-G percentage increases to 94%, with the majority of these located within the swine specific SINE retrotransposon PRE-1. We also observe evidence of A-to-G editing within coding regions that were previously verified in primates. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, our high-throughput evidence suggests that pervasive RNA editing by ADAR can exist outside of the primate lineage to dramatically enhance genetic variation in pigs.",2017 May 9,BMC Genomics. 2017 May 9;18(1):360. doi: 10.1186/s12864-017-3766-7.,"['Funkhouser SA', 'Steibel JP', 'Bates RO', 'Raney NE', 'Schenk D', 'Ernst CW']",False
27362366,ADAR1 deletion induces NFκB and interferon signaling dependent liver inflammation and fibrosis.,"Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) 1 binds and edits double-stranded (ds) RNA secondary structures found mainly within untranslated regions of many transcripts. In the current research, our aim was to study the role of ADAR1 in liver homeostasis. As previous studies show a conserved immunoregulatory function for ADAR1 in mammalians, we focused on its role in preventing chronic hepatic inflammation and the associated activation of hepatic stellate cells to produce extracellular matrix and promote fibrosis. We show that hepatocytes specific ADAR1 knock out (KO) mice display massive liver damage with multifocal inflammation and fibrogenesis. The bioinformatics analysis of the microarray gene-expression datasets of ADAR1 KO livers reveled a type-I interferons signature and an enrichment for immune response genes compared to control littermate livers. Furthermore, we found that in vitro silencing of ADAR1 expression in HepG2 cells leads to enhanced transcription of NFκB target genes, foremost of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL6 and IL8. We also discovered immune cell-independent paracrine signaling among ADAR1-depleted HepG2 cells and hepatic stellate cells, leading to the activation of the latter cell type to adopt a profibrogenic phenotype. This paracrine communication dependent mainly on the production and secretion of the cytokine IL6 induced by ADAR1 silencing in hepatocytes. Thus, our findings shed a new light on the vital regulatory role of ADAR1 in hepatic immune homeostasis, chiefly its inhibitory function on the crosstalk between the NFκB and type-I interferons signaling cascades, restraining the development of liver inflammation and fibrosis.",2017 May 4,RNA Biol. 2017 May 4;14(5):587-602. doi: 10.1080/15476286.2016.1203501.

28550310,"A-to-I editing in human miRNAs is enriched in seed sequence, influenced by sequence contexts and significantly hypoedited in glioblastoma multiforme.","Editing in microRNAs, particularly in seed can significantly alter the choice of their target genes. We show that out of 13 different human tissues, different regions of brain showed higher adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) editing in mature miRNAs. These events were enriched in seed sequence (73.33%), which was not observed for cytosine to uracil (17.86%) editing. More than half of the edited miRNAs showed increased stability, 72.7% of which had ΔΔG values less than -6.0 Kcal/mole and for all of them the edited adenosines mis-paired with cytosines on the pre-miRNA structure. A seed-editing event in hsa-miR-411 (with A - C mismatch) lead to increased expression of the mature form compared to the unedited version in cell culture experiments. Further, small RNA sequencing of GBM patients identified significant miRNA hypoediting which correlated with downregulation of ADAR2 both in metadata and qRT-PCR based validation. Twenty-two significant (11 novel) A-to-I hypoediting events were identified in GBM samples. This study highlights the importance of specific sequence and structural requirements of pre-miRNA for editing along with a suggestive crucial role for ADAR2.

28542129,ADAR1-mediated 3' UTR editing and expression control of antiapoptosis genes fine-tunes cellular apoptosis response.,"Adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing constitutes a crucial component of the cellular transcriptome and critically underpins organism survival and development. While recent high-throughput approaches have provided comprehensive documentation of the RNA editome, its functional output remains mostly unresolved, particularly for events in the non-coding regions. Gene ontology analysis of the known RNA editing targets unveiled a preponderance of genes related to apoptosis regulation, among which proto-oncogenes XIAP and MDM2 encode two the most abundantly edited transcripts. To further decode this potential functional connection, here we showed that the main RNA editor ADAR1 directly targets this 3' UTR editing of XIAP and MDM2, and further exerts a negative regulation on the expression of their protein products. This post-transcriptional silencing role was mediated via the inverted Alu elements in the 3' UTR but independent of alteration in transcript stability or miRNA targeting. Rather, we discovered that ADAR1 competes transcript occupancy with the RNA shuttling factor STAU1 to facilitate nuclear retention of the XIAP and MDM2 mRNAs. As a consequence, ADAR1 may acquire functionality in part by conferring spatial distribution and translation efficiency of the target transcripts. Finally, abrogation of ADAR1 expression or catalytic activity elicited a XIAP-dependent suppression of apoptotic response, whereas ectopic expression reversed this protective effect on cell death. Together, our results extended the known functions of ADAR1 and RNA editing to the critical fine-tuning of the intracellular apoptotic signaling and also provided mechanistic explanation for ADAR1's roles in development and tumorigenesis.",2017 May 25,Cell Death Dis. 2017 May 25;8(5):e2833. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2017.12.,"['Yang CC', 'Chen YT', 'Chang YF', 'Liu H', 'Kuo YP', 'Shih CT', 'Liao WC', 'Chen HW', 'Tsai WS', 'Tan BC']",True
28126736,RNA editing enzyme ADAR2 is a mediator of neuropathic pain after peripheral nerve injury.,"Transcriptional and post-translational regulations are important in peripheral nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain, but little is known about the role of post-transcriptional modification. Our objective was to determine the possible effect of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) enzymes, which catalyze post-transcriptional RNA editing, in tactile allodynia, a hallmark of neuropathic pain. Seven days after L5 spinal nerve transection (SNT) in adult mice, we found an increase in ADAR2 expression and a decrease in ADAR3 expression in the injured, but not in the uninjured, dorsal root ganglions (DRGs). These changes were accompanied by elevated levels of editing at the D site of the serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) 2C receptor (5-HT(2C)R), at the I/V site of coatomer protein complex subunit α (COPA), and at the R/G site of AMPA receptor subunit GluA2 in the injured DRG. Compared to Adar2(+/+)/Gria2(R/R) littermate controls, Adar2(-/-)/Gria2(R/R) mice completely lacked the increased editing of 5-HT(2C)R, COPA, and GluA2 transcripts in the injured DRG and showed attenuated tactile allodynia after SNT. Furthermore, the antidepressant fluoxetine inhibited neuropathic allodynia after injury and reduced the COPA I/V site editing in the injured DRG.

28278381,Alternative Splicing of STAT3 Is Affected by RNA Editing.,"A-to-I RNA editing, carried out by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) enzymes, is an epigenetic phenomenon of posttranscriptional modifications on pre-mRNA. RNA editing in intronic sequences may influence alternative splicing of flanking exons. We have previously shown that conditions that induce editing result in elevated expression of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), preferentially the alternatively-spliced STAT3β isoform. Mechanisms regulating alternative splicing of STAT3 have not been elucidated. STAT3 undergoes A-to-I RNA editing in an intron residing in proximity to the alternatively spliced exon. We hypothesized that RNA editing plays a role in regulating alternative splicing toward STAT3β. In this study we extend our observation connecting RNA editing to the preferential induction of STAT3β expression. We study the involvement of ADAR1 in STAT3 editing and reveal the connection between editing and alternative splicing of STAT3. Deferoaxamine treatment caused the induction in STAT3 RNA editing and STAT3β expression. Silencing ADAR1 caused a decrease in STAT3 editing and expression with a preferential decrease in STAT3β. Cells transfected with a mutated minigene showed preferential splicing toward the STAT3β transcript. Editing in the STAT3 intron is performed by ADAR1 and affects STAT3 alternative splicing.

An increase in the cellular expression level of DHFR is one of the mechanisms of tumor resistance to methotrexate. The present study investigated the possibility that adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing, which causes nucleotide conversion by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) enzymes, might modulate DHFR expression. In human breast adenocarcinoma-derived MCF-7 cells, 26 RNA editing sites were identified in the 3'-UTR of DHFR. Knockdown of ADAR1 decreased the RNA editing levels of DHFR and resulted in a decrease in the DHFR mRNA and protein levels, indicating that ADAR1 up-regulates DHFR expression. Using a computational analysis, miR-25-3p and miR-125a-3p were predicted to bind to the non-edited 3'-UTR of DHFR but not to the edited sequence. The decrease in DHFR expression by the knockdown of ADAR1 was restored by transfection of antisense oligonucleotides for these miRNAs, suggesting that RNA editing mediated up-regulation of DHFR requires the function of these miRNAs. Interestingly, we observed that the knockdown of ADAR1 decreased cell viability and increased the sensitivity of MCF-7 cells to methotrexate. ADAR1 expression levels and the RNA editing levels in the 3'-UTR of DHFR in breast cancer tissues were higher than those in adjacent normal tissues. Collectively, the present study demonstrated that ADAR1 positively regulates the expression of DHFR by editing the miR-25-3p and miR-125a-3p binding sites in the 3'-UTR of DHFR, enhancing cellular proliferation and resistance to methotrexate.",2017 Mar 24,J Biol Chem. 2017 Mar 24;292(12):4873-4884. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M117.775684.

28167698,ADAR1 and PACT contribute to efficient translation of transcripts containing HIV-1 trans-activating response (TAR) element.,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) has evolved various measures to counter the host cell's innate antiviral response during the course of infection. Interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene products are produced following HIV-1 infection to limit viral replication, but viral proteins and RNAs counteract their effect. One such mechanism is specifically directed against the IFN-induced Protein Kinase PKR, which is centrally important to the cellular antiviral response. In the presence of viral RNAs, PKR is activated and phosphorylates the translation initiation factor eIF2α. This shuts down the synthesis of both host and viral proteins, allowing the cell to mount an effective antiviral response. PACT (protein activator of PKR) is a cellular protein activator of PKR, primarily functioning to activate PKR in response to cellular stress. Recent studies have indicated that during HIV-1 infection, PACT's normal cellular function is compromised and that PACT is unable to activate PKR. Using various reporter systems and in vitro kinase assays, we establish in this report that interactions between PACT, ADAR1 and HIV-1-encoded Tat protein diminish the activation of PKR in response to HIV-1 infection.

28167531,Adenosine Deaminase That Acts on RNA 3 (ADAR3) Binding to Glutamate Receptor Subunit B Pre-mRNA Inhibits RNA Editing in Glioblastoma.,"RNA editing is a cellular process that precisely alters nucleotide sequences, thus regulating gene expression and generating protein diversity. Over 60% of human transcripts undergo adenosine to inosine RNA editing, and editing is required for normal development and proper neuronal function of animals. Editing of one adenosine in the transcript encoding the glutamate receptor subunit B, glutamate receptor ionotropic AMPA 2 (GRIA2), modifies a codon, replacing the genomically encoded glutamine (Q) with arginine (R); thus this editing site is referred to as the Q/R site. Editing at the Q/R site of GRIA2 is essential, and reduced editing of GRIA2 transcripts has been observed in patients suffering from glioblastoma. In glioblastoma, incorporation of unedited GRIA2 subunits leads to a calcium-permeable glutamate receptor, which can promote cell migration and tumor invasion. In this study, we identify adenosine deaminase that acts on RNA 3 (ADAR3) as an important regulator of Q/R site editing, investigate its mode of action, and detect elevated ADAR3 expression in glioblastoma tumors compared with adjacent brain tissue. Overexpression of ADAR3 in astrocyte and astrocytoma cell lines inhibits RNA editing at the Q/R site of GRIA2 Furthermore, the double-stranded RNA binding domains of ADAR3 are required for repression of RNA editing. As the Q/R site of GRIA2 is specifically edited by ADAR2, we suggest that ADAR3 directly competes with ADAR2 for binding to GRIA2 transcript, inhibiting RNA editing, as evidenced by the direct binding of ADAR3 to the GRIA2 pre-mRNA.

28199207,Assessing the potential function of ADAR1 in virus-associated sepsis.,"Sepsis syndrome is a common and frequently fatal clinical condition. It is defined by the presence of both infection and an uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response. It represents a major, although largely unappreciated, healthcare problem worldwide. It is especially problematic in infants and toddlers who show markedly increased susceptibility to severe infections caused by various pathogens, including viruses. Viruses are important causative agents of sepsis. Host adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) catalyzes adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) editing of RNA transcripts, thus changing viral RNAs and exerting antiviral and proviral effects. In addition, ADAR1 promotes viral replication by directly interacting with protein kinase R and suppressing its kinase activity. We here discuss the function of ADAR1 and its regulatory role in viral infection. Further, we establish the relationship between ADAR1 and virus-associated sepsis, thus providing an important basis for the development of novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of virus-associated sepsis.",2017 Mar 1,Front Biosci (Landmark Ed). 2017 Mar 1;22(8):1355-1364. doi: 10.2741/4548.,"['Zhuang Y', 'Peng H', 'Chen Y', 'Zhou S', 'Chen Y']",True
28031250,A-to-I RNA editing promotes developmental stage-specific gene and lncRNA expression.,"A-to-I RNA editing is a conserved widespread phenomenon in which adenosine (A) is converted to inosine (I) by adenosine deaminases (ADARs) in double-stranded RNA regions, mainly noncoding. Mutations in ADAR enzymes in Caenorhabditis elegans cause defects in normal development but are not lethal as in human and mouse. Previous studies in C. elegans indicated competition between RNA interference (RNAi) and RNA editing mechanisms, based on the observation that worms that lack both mechanisms do not exhibit defects, in contrast to the developmental defects observed when only RNA editing is absent. To study the effects of RNA editing on gene expression and function, we established a novel screen that enabled us to identify thousands of RNA editing sites in nonrepetitive regions in the genome. These include dozens of genes that are edited at their 3' UTR region. We found that these genes are mainly germline and neuronal genes, and that they are down-regulated in the absence of ADAR enzymes. Moreover, we discovered that almost half of these genes are edited in a developmental-specific manner, indicating that RNA editing is a highly regulated process. We found that many pseudogenes and other lncRNAs are also extensively down-regulated in the absence of ADARs in the embryo but not in the fourth larval (L4) stage. This down-regulation is not observed upon additional knockout of RNAi. Furthermore, levels of siRNAs aligned to pseudogenes in ADAR mutants are enhanced. Taken together, our results suggest a role for RNA editing in normal growth and development by regulating silencing via RNAi.",2017 Mar,Genome Res. 2017 Mar;27(3):462-470. doi: 10.1101/gr.211169.116.

28533408,RNA editing of SLC22A3 drives early tumor invasion and metastasis in familial esophageal cancer.,"Like many complex human diseases, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is known to cluster in families. Familial ESCC cases often show early onset and worse prognosis than the sporadic cases. However, the molecular genetic basis underlying the development of familial ESCC is mostly unknown. We reported that SLC22A3 is significantly down-regulated in nontumor esophageal tissues from patients with familial ESCC compared with tissues from patients with sporadic ESCCs. A-to-I RNA editing of the SLC22A3 gene results in its reduced expression in the nontumor esophageal tissues of familial ESCCs and is significantly correlated with lymph node metastasis. The RNA-editing enzyme ADAR2, a familial ESCC susceptibility gene identified by our post hoc genome-wide association study, is positively correlated with the editing level of SLC22A3 Moreover, functional studies showed that SLC22A3 is a metastasis suppressor in ESCC, and deregulation of SLC22A3 facilitates cell invasion and filopodia formation by reducing its direct association with α-actinin-4 (ACTN4), leading to the increased actin-binding activity of ACTN4 in normal esophageal cells.

However, whether adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing has functions in nuclear genes involved in mitochondria remains elusive. Here, we retrieved 707,246 A-to-I RNA editing sites in Macaca mulatta leveraging massive transcriptomes of 30 different tissues and genomes of nine tissues, together with the reported data, and found that A-to-I RNA editing occurred frequently in nuclear genes that have functions in mitochondria. The mitochondrial structure, the level of ATP production, and the expression of some key genes involved in mitochondrial function were dysregulated after knocking down the expression of ADAR1 and ADAR2, the key genes encoding the enzyme responsible for RNA editing. When investigating dynamic changes of RNA editing during brain development, an amino-acid-changing RNA editing site (I234/V) in MFN1, a mediator of mitochondrial fusion, was identified to be significantly correlated with age, and could influence the function of MFN1. When studying transcriptomes of brain disorder, we found that dysregulated RNA editing sites in autism were also enriched within genes having mitochondrial functions.

Here, we use the kainate receptor subunit GluK2 as a model iGluR cargo to show that the assembly, early secretory pathway trafficking, and surface delivery of iGluRs are all controlled by neuronal activity. We show that the delivery of de novo kainate receptors is differentially regulated by modulation of GluK2 Q/R editing, PKC phosphorylation, and PDZ ligand interactions.

Although the anti-tumorigenic role of BLCAP has been examined in preliminarily studies, the relationship between BLCAP function and A-to-I RNA editing in cervical carcinogenesis still require further exploration. Herein, we analyzed the coding sequence of BLCAP transcripts in 35 paired cervical cancer samples using high-throughput sequencing. Of note, editing levels of three novel editing sites were statistically different between cancerous and adjacent cervical tissues, and editing of these three sites was closely correlated. Moreover, two editing sites of BLCAP coding region were mapped-in the key YXXQ motif which can bind to SH2 domain of STAT3. Further studies revealed that BLCAP interacted with signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and inhibited its phosphorylation, while A-to-I RNA editing of BLCAP lost the inhibition to STAT3 activation in cervical cancer cell lines.

In reproductive tissues, microRNAs (miRNAs) are emerging as key targets of EDCs. Here, we analysed changes in the testis ""miRNome"" (and their biogenesis mechanism) in chronically exposed adult mice to a cocktail of five EDCs containing 0.3 mg/kg-body weight (BW)/day of each phthalate (DEHP, DBP, BBP) and 0.05 mg/kg-BW/day of each alkylphenol (NP, OP), from conception to adulthood. The testis ""miRNome"" was characterised using next-generation sequencing (NGS). Expression levels of genes involved in miRNA biogenesis were measured by RT-qPCR, as well as several physiological and cytological parameters.

A significant decrease of intratesticular estradiol but not testosterone was detected. Functional analysis showed altered spermatogenesis, germ cell apoptosis and negative correlation of miR-18a-5p with Nr1h2 involved in the deregulation of the steroidogenesis pathway.

28040796,Role of RPL39 in Metaplastic Breast Cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Metaplastic breast cancer is one of the most therapeutically challenging forms of breast cancer because of its highly heterogeneous and chemoresistant nature. We have previously demonstrated that ribosomal protein L39 (RPL39) and its gain-of-function mutation A14V have oncogenic activity in triple-negative breast cancer and this activity may be mediated through inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). The function of RPL39 and A14V in other breast cancer subtypes is currently unknown. The objective of this study was to determine the role and mechanism of action of RPL39 in metaplastic breast cancer. METHODS: Both competitive allele-specific and droplet digital polymerase chain reaction were used to determine the RPL39 A14V mutation rate in metaplastic breast cancer patient samples. The impact of RPL39 and iNOS expression on patient overall survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Co-immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analyses were used for mechanistic evaluation of RPL39. RESULTS: The RPL39 A14V mutation rate was 97.5% (39/40 tumor samples). High RPL39 (hazard ratio = 0.71, 95% confidence interval = 0.55 to 0.91, P = 006) and iNOS expression (P = 003) were associated with reduced patient overall survival. iNOS inhibition with the pan-NOS inhibitor N(G)-methyl-L-arginine acetate decreased in vitro proliferation and migration, in vivo tumor growth in both BCM-4664 and BCM-3807 patient-derived xenograft models (P = 04 and P = 02, respectively), and in vitro and in vivo chemoresistance. Mechanistically, RPL39 mediated its cancer-promoting actions through iNOS signaling, which was driven by the RNA editing enzyme adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1.

In contrast, the biological function of the ADAR1p110 isoform, which is usually located in the nucleus, is largely unknown. Here, we show that stress-activated phosphorylation of ADAR1p110 by MKK6-p38-MSK MAP kinases promotes its binding to Exportin-5 and its export from the nucleus. After translocating to the cytoplasm, ADAR1p110 suppresses apoptosis in stressed cells by protecting many antiapoptotic gene transcripts that contain 3'-untranslated-region dsRNA structures primarily comprising inverted Alu repeats. ADAR1p110 competitively inhibits binding of Staufen1 to the 3'-untranslated-region dsRNAs and antagonizes Staufen1-mediated mRNA decay.

Furthermore, resistant GA dinucleotides are enriched on the positive (but not negative) strand, indicating that the former is under stronger purifying selection than the latter.

By comparing RNA-seq data of a given cell type before and after a specific perturbation, we can detect and quantify SNVs in the RNA and discover SNVs with altered frequencies between distinct cellular states. Such differential variants in RNA (DVRs) may reflect allele-specific changes in gene expression or RNA processing, as well as changes in RNA editing in response to cellular perturbations or stimuli. RESULTS: We have developed rMATS-DVR, a convenient and user-friendly software program to streamline the discovery of DVRs between two RNA-seq sample groups with replicates. rMATS-DVR combines a stringent GATK-based pipeline for calling SNVs including SNPs and RNA editing events in RNA-seq reads, with our rigorous rMATS statistical model for identifying differential isoform ratios using RNA-seq sequence count data with replicates. We applied rMATS-DVR to RNA-seq data of the human chronic myeloid leukemia cell line K562 in response to shRNA knockdown of the RNA editing enzyme ADAR1. rMATS-DVR discovered 1372 significant DVRs between knockdown and control. These DVRs encompassed known SNPs and RNA editing sites as well as novel SNVs, with the majority of DVRs corresponding to known RNA editing sites repressed after ADAR1 knockdown.

28482199,ADAR deaminase A-to-I editing of DNA and RNA moieties of RNA:DNA hybrids has implications for the mechanism of Ig somatic hypermutation.,"The implications are discussed of recently published biochemical studies on ADAR-mediated A-to-I DNA and RNA deamination at RNA:DNA hybrids. The significance of these data are related to previous work on strand-biased and codon-context mutation signatures in B lymphocytes and cancer genomes. Those studies have established that there are two significant strand biases at A:T and G:C base pairs, A-site mutations exceed T-site mutations (A>>T) by 2.9 fold and G-site mutations exceed C-site mutations (G>>C) by 1.7 fold. Both these strand biases are inconsistent with alternative ""DNA Deamination"" mechanisms, yet are expected consequences of the RNA/RT-based ""Reverse Transcriptase"" mechanism of immunoglobulin (Ig) somatic hypermutation (SHM). The A-to-I DNA editing component at RNA:DNA hybrids that is likely to occur in Transcription Bubbles, while important, is of far lower A-to-I editing efficiency than in dsRNA substrates. The RNA moiety of RNA:DNA hybrids is also edited at similar lower frequencies relative to the editing rate at dsRNA substrates. Further, if the A-to-I DNA editing at RNA:DNA hybrids were the sole cause of A-to-I (read as A-to-G) mutation events for Ig SHM in vivo then the exact opposite strand biases at A:T base pairs (T>>A) of what is actually observed (A>>T) would be predicted. It is concluded that the strand-biased somatic mutation patterns at both A:T and G:C base pairs in vivo are best interpreted by the sequential steps of the RNA/RT-based mechanism. Further, the direct DNA A-to-I deamination at Transcription Bubbles is expected to contribute to the T-to-C component of the strand-biased Ig SHM spectrum.",2017 Jul,DNA Repair (Amst). 2017 Jul;55:1-6. doi: 10.1016/j.dnarep.2017.04.004.

Defining molecular mechanisms/targets contributing to cancer aggressiveness is needed to guide the design of new screening and targeted treatments. Here, we describe a novel tumor promoting function for the Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factor-6 (CPSF6). Importantly, aggressive breast cancer cells of luminal B, HER2-overexpressing and triple negative subtypes show dependency on CPSF6 for viability and tumorigenic capacity. Mechanistically, we found CPSF6 to interact with components of the A-to-I RNA editing machinery, paraspeckles and ADAR1 enzyme, and to be required for their physical integrity. Clinically, we found CPSF6 and all core paraspeckles proteins to be overexpressed in human breast cancer cases and their expression to correlate with poor patient outcomes.

However, the regulatory mechanism of ADAR1 in esophageal squamous cell carcinomas remains largely unknown. In this study, we investigated ADAR1 expression and its association with RNA editing in esophageal squamous cell carcinomas. RNA sequencing applied to esophageal squamous cell carcinoma clinical samples showed that ADAR1 expression was correlated with the expression of STAT1, STAT2, and IRF9. In vitro experiments showed that the abundance of ADAR1 protein was associated with the induced activation of the JAK/STAT pathway by type I interferon. RNA sequencing results showed that treatment with type I interferon caused an increase in the number and degree of RNA editing in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cell lines. In conclusion, the activation of the JAK/STAT pathway is a regulatory mechanism of ADAR1 expression and causes abnormal RNA editing profile in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.

These sites are less evolutionarily conserved, more disperse, less likely to be involved in secondary structures, and more likely to be located in exons. Interestingly, hypomorph mutants for ADAR display a weaker transcriptional response to temperature changes than wild-type flies and a highly abnormal behavioral response upon temperature increase. In sum, our data shows that ADAR is essential for proper temperature adaptation, a key behavior trait that is essential for survival of flies in the wild.

A significant fraction of these proteins were previously demonstrated to be associated to the Long INterspersed Element 1 (LINE1 or L1) ribonucleoparticles and to regulate the life cycle of L1 retrotransposons that continuously re-enter host-genome.Hence, we investigated the function of ADAR1 in the regulation of L1 activity.By using different cell-culture based retrotransposition assays in HeLa cells, we demonstrated a novel function of ADAR1 as suppressor of L1 retrotransposition. Apparently, this inhibitory mechanism does not occur through ADAR1 editing activity. Furthermore, we showed that ADAR1 binds the basal L1 RNP complex. Overall, these data support the role of ADAR1 as regulator of L1 life cycle.",2017 Jan 9,Nucleic Acids Res. 2017 Jan 9;45(1):155-168. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkw834.

It is carried out by ADAR enzymes and contributes to both transcriptomic and proteomic expansion. RNA editing has pivotal cellular effects and its deregulation has been linked to a variety of human disorders including neurological and neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. Despite its biological relevance, many physiological and functional aspects of RNA editing are yet elusive. Here, we present REDIportal, available online at http://srv00.recas.ba.infn.it/atlas/, the largest and comprehensive collection of RNA editing in humans including more than 4.5 millions of A-to-I events detected in 55 body sites from thousands of RNAseq experiments. REDIportal embeds RADAR database and represents the first editing resource designed to answer functional questions, enabling the inspection and browsing of editing levels in a variety of human samples, tissues and body sites.

Here, we investigated the mechanism by which the nuclear pore complex (NPC) is disrupted in dying motor neurons in a mechanistic ALS mouse model (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 2 (ADAR2) conditional knockout (AR2) mice) and in ALS patients. We showed that nucleoporins (Nups) that constituted the NPC were cleaved by activated calpain via a Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptor-mediated mechanism in dying motor neurons lacking ADAR2 expression in AR2 mice. In these neurons, nucleo-cytoplasmic transport was disrupted, and the level of the transcript elongation enzyme RNA polymerase II phosphorylated at Ser2 was significantly decreased. Analogous changes were observed in motor neurons lacking ADAR2 immunoreactivity in sporadic ALS patients. Therefore, calpain-dependent NPC disruption may participate in ALS pathogenesis, and inhibiting Ca(2+)-mediated cell death signals may be a therapeutic strategy for ALS.",2017 Jan 3,Sci Rep. 2017 Jan 3;7:39994. doi: 10.1038/srep39994.,"['Yamashita T', 'Aizawa H', 'Teramoto S', 'Akamatsu M', 'Kwak S']",True
28049429,JACUSA: site-specific identification of RNA editing events from replicate sequencing data.,"BACKGROUND: RNA editing is a co-transcriptional modification that increases the molecular diversity, alters secondary structure and protein coding sequences by changing the sequence of transcripts. The most common RNA editing modification is the single base substitution (A→I) that is catalyzed by the members of the Adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADAR) family. Typically, editing sites are identified as RNA-DNA-differences (RDDs) in a comparison of genome and transcriptome data from next-generation sequencing experiments. However, a method for robust detection of site-specific editing events from replicate RNA-seq data has not been published so far. Even more surprising, condition-specific editing events, which would show up as differences in RNA-RNA comparisons (RRDs) and depend on particular cellular states, are rarely discussed in the literature. RESULTS: We present JACUSA, a versatile one-stop solution to detect single nucleotide variant positions from comparing RNA-DNA and/or RNA-RNA sequencing samples. The performance of JACUSA has been carefully evaluated and compared to other variant callers in an in silico benchmark. JACUSA outperforms other algorithms in terms of the F measure, which combines precision and recall, in all benchmark scenarios. This performance margin is highest for the RNA-RNA comparison scenario. We further validated JACUSA's performance by testing its ability to detect A→I events using sequencing data from a human cell culture experiment and publicly available RNA-seq data from Drosophila melanogaster heads. To this end, we performed whole genome and RNA sequencing of HEK-293 cells on samples with lowered activity of candidate RNA editing enzymes. JACUSA has a higher recall and comparable precision for detecting true editing sites in RDD comparisons of HEK-293 data. Intriguingly, JACUSA captures most A→I events from RRD comparisons of RNA sequencing data derived from Drosophila and HEK-293 data sets. CONCLUSION: Our software JACUSA detects single nucleotide variants by comparing data from next-generation sequencing experiments (RNA-DNA or RNA-RNA). In practice, JACUSA shows higher recall and comparable precision in detecting A→I sites from RNA-DNA comparisons, while showing higher precision and recall in RNA-RNA comparisons.",2017 Jan 3,BMC Bioinformatics. 2017 Jan 3;18(1):7. doi: 10.1186/s12859-016-1432-8.,"['Piechotta M', 'Wyler E', 'Ohler U', 'Landthaler M', 'Dieterich C']",False
28109322,ADAR1 overexpression is associated with cervical cancer progression and angiogenesis.,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to assess the role of RNA-dependent adenosine deaminase (ADAR1) in cervical squamous cell carcinoma occurrence and progression. METHODS: ADAR1 expression levels in stage IA and stage IIA cervical squamous cell carcinoma (group A), cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) specimens (group B), as well as normal and inflamed cervical tissue samples (group C) were assessed by immunohistochemistry. Clinical and pathological data of cervical squamous cell carcinoma patients undergoing surgery were retrospectively evaluated. Chi-square test, comparative analysis of survival curve, disease-free survival and COX risk assessment method were used to understand the association of ADAR1 with the occurrence and progression and prognostic significance of cervical squamous cell carcinoma. RESULTS: ADAR1 is expressed in the cytoplasm and nuclei. The expression level was high in squamous cell carcinoma tissues (81.18%), while relatively low in the CIN group (21.56%). And there was no expression in non-cancerous tissues. The differences between them were statistically significant using P < 0.05 as criterion. One-factor analysis revealed that ADAR1 was significantly correlated with tumor diameter, horizontal diffusion diameter, vascular invasion, parametrial invasion, vaginal involvement, and pathologically diagnostic criteria for perineural invasion (PNI). Meanwhile, the overall survival rate of ADAR1 positive patients was significantly lower compared with that of patients with no ADAR1 expression (P < 0.05). Analysis also showed that disease-free survival time of ADAR1 positive patients was shorter than that of ADAR1 negative patients, and the difference was significant (P < 0.01). Finally, COX risk assessment showed that parametrical invasion had independent prognostic factors for overall survival of squamous cell carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicated that ADAR1 might play an important role in the occurrence, progression and prognosis of cervical squamous cancer.",2017 Jan 21,Diagn Pathol. 2017 Jan 21;12(1):12. doi: 10.1186/s13000-017-0600-0.,"['Chen Y', 'Wang H', 'Lin W', 'Shuai P']",True
28106799,"RNA Editing, ADAR1, and the Innate Immune Response.","RNA editing, particularly A-to-I RNA editing, has been shown to play an essential role in mammalian embryonic development and tissue homeostasis, and is implicated in the pathogenesis of many diseases including skin pigmentation disorder, autoimmune and inflammatory tissue injury, neuron degeneration, and various malignancies. A-to-I RNA editing is carried out by a small group of enzymes, the adenosine deaminase acting on RNAs (ADARs). Only three members of this protein family, ADAR1-3, exist in mammalian cells. ADAR3 is a catalytically null enzyme and the most significant function of ADAR2 was found to be in editing on the neuron receptor GluR-B mRNA. ADAR1, however, has been shown to play more significant roles in biological and pathological conditions. Although there remains much that is not known about how ADAR1 regulates cellular function, recent findings point to regulation of the innate immune response as an important function of ADAR1. Without appropriate RNA editing by ADAR1, endogenous RNA transcripts stimulate cytosolic RNA sensing receptors and therefore activate the IFN-inducing signaling pathways. Overactivation of innate immune pathways can lead to tissue injury and dysfunction. However, obvious gaps in our knowledge persist as to how ADAR1 regulates innate immune responses through RNA editing. Here, we review critical findings from ADAR1 mechanistic studies focusing on its regulatory function in innate immune responses and identify some of the important unanswered questions in the field.",2017 Jan 18,Genes (Basel). 2017 Jan 18;8(1):41. doi: 10.3390/genes8010041.,"['Wang Q', 'Li X', 'Qi R', 'Billiar T']",True
27926534,iRNA-AI: identifying the adenosine to inosine editing sites in RNA sequences.,"Catalyzed by adenosine deaminase (ADAR), the adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) editing in RNA is not only involved in various important biological processes, but also closely associated with a series of major diseases. Therefore, knowledge about the A-to-I editing sites in RNA is crucially important for both basic research and drug development. Given an uncharacterized RNA sequence that contains many adenosine (A) residues, can we identify which one of them can be of A-to-I editing, and which one cannot? Unfortunately, so far no computational method whatsoever has been developed to address such an important problem based on the RNA sequence information alone. To fill this empty area, we have proposed a predictor called iRNA-AI by incorporating the chemical properties of nucleotides and their sliding occurrence density distribution along a RNA sequence into the general form of pseudo nucleotide composition (PseKNC). It has been shown by the rigorous jackknife test and independent dataset test that the performance of the proposed predictor is quite promising. For the convenience of most experimental scientists, a user-friendly web-server for iRNA-AI has been established at http://lin.uestc.edu.cn/server/iRNA-AI/, by which users can easily get their desired results without the need to go through the mathematical details.",2017 Jan 17,Oncotarget. 2017 Jan 17;8(3):4208-4217. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.13758.,"['Chen W', 'Feng P', 'Yang H', 'Ding H', 'Lin H', 'Chou KC']",True

We recently introduced a novel guideRNA that allows for the recruitment of human ADAR2 to manipulate genetic information. Here, we show that the current guideRNA design is already able to recruit another human deaminase, ADAR1, in both isoforms, p110 and p150. However, further optimization seems necessary as the current design is less efficient for ADAR1 isoforms. Furthermore, we describe hotspots at which the guideRNA itself is edited and show a way to circumvent this auto-editing without losing editing efficiency at the target. Both findings are important for the advancement of site-directed RNA editing as a tool in basic biology or as a platform for therapeutic editing.",2017 Jan 14,Genes (Basel). 2017 Jan 14;8(1):34. doi: 10.3390/genes8010034.,"['Heep M', 'Mach P', 'Reautschnig P', 'Wettengel J', 'Stafforst T']",True
28395340,Testicular adenosine to inosine RNA editing in the mouse is mediated by ADARB1.,"Adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing occurs in a wide range of tissues and cell types and can be catalyzed by one of the two adenosine deaminase acting on double-stranded RNA enzymes, ADAR and ADARB1. Editing can impact both coding and noncoding regions of RNA, and in higher organisms has been proposed to function in adaptive evolution. Neither the prevalence of A-to-I editing nor the role of either ADAR or ADARB1 has been examined in the context of germ cell development in mammals. Computational analysis of whole testis and cell-type specific RNA-sequencing data followed by molecular confirmation demonstrated that A-to-I RNA editing occurs in both the germ line and in somatic Sertoli cells in two targets, Cog3 and Rpa1. Expression analysis demonstrated both Adar and Adarb1 were expressed in both Sertoli cells and in a cell-type dependent manner during germ cell development. Conditional ablation of Adar did not impact testicular RNA editing in either germ cells or Sertoli cells. Additionally, Adar ablation in either cell type did not have gross impacts on germ cell development or male fertility. In contrast, global Adarb1 knockout animals demonstrated a complete loss of A-to-I RNA editing in spite of normal germ cell development. Taken together, these observations demonstrate ADARB1 mediates A-to-I RNA editing in the testis and these editing events are dispensable for male fertility in an inbred mouse strain in the lab.",2017 Jan 1,Biol Reprod. 2017 Jan 1;96(1):244-253. doi: 10.1095/biolreprod.116.145151.,"['Snyder EM', 'Licht K', 'Braun RE']",True

However, recent studies demonstrated that 70-80% of circadian-oscillating mRNAs have no obvious rhythms in their de novo transcription, indicating the potential importance of post-transcriptional regulation. Our CLOCK-ChIP-seq analysis identified rhythmic expression of adenosine deaminase, RNA-specific, B1 (Adarb1, also known as Adar2), an adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA-editing enzyme. RNA-seq showed circadian rhythms of ADARB1-mediated A-to-I editing in a variety of transcripts. In Adarb1-knockout mice, rhythms of large populations of mRNA were attenuated, indicating a profound impact of ADARB1-mediated A-to-I editing on RNA rhythms. Furthermore, Adarb1-knockout mice exhibited short-period rhythms in locomotor activity and gene expression. These phenotypes were associated with abnormal accumulation of CRY2. The present study identifies A-to-I RNA editing as a key mechanism of post-transcriptional regulation in the circadian clockwork.",2017 Jan,Nat Genet. 2017 Jan;49(1):146-151. doi: 10.1038/ng.3731.

27334229,Emerging roles of the processing of nucleic acids and Toll-like receptors in innate immune responses to nucleic acids.,"Nucleic acid (NA) is continuously degraded in lysosomes, cytoplasm, and nucleus. NA degradation has a key role in preventing hazardous activation of NA sensors. DNA degradation by lysosomal and cytoplasmic DNases prevents homeostatic activation of cytoplasmic DNA sensing pathways. Crude NA, however, is not sufficient for stimulating NA sensors. mRNAs and rRNAs need to be processed by inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE-1) or RNase L before stimulating cytoplasmic RNA sensors. Activation of cytoplasmic RNA sensors by processed RNAs is tightly controlled by their degradation through the machineries, such as RNA editing, by adenosine (A) deaminases that act on RNA 1 (ADAR1) and the RNA exosome. Impaired degradation of processed RNAs in humans causes activation of cytoplasmic RNA sensors, leading to Aicardi-Goutières syndrome or trichohepatoenteric syndrome. Lysosomal TLRs are also dependent on NA processing in lysosomes. Digestion of dsDNA by DNase II is required for TLR9 response to ssDNA. TLR7 and TLR8 respond to ribonucleosides and oligoribonucleotides, instead of ssRNA itself, indicating requirement for RNA processing. NA-sensing TLRs themselves need to be processed by lysosomal proteases. Without processing, TLR8 and TLR9 fail to form dimers. In addition to NA degradation, the processing of NAs and TLRs by a variety of enzymes is an emerging concept on the control of innate immune responses to NAs.",2017 Jan,J Leukoc Biol. 2017 Jan;101(1):135-142. doi: 10.1189/jlb.4MR0316-108R.

Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 2 (ADAR2) specifically catalyzes GluA2 Q/R site-RNA editing. Furthermore, conditional ADAR2 knockout mice (AR2) exhibit a progressive ALS phenotype with TDP-43 pathology in the motor neurons, which is the most reliable pathological marker of ALS. Therefore, the evidence indicates that ADAR2 downregulation is a causative factor in ALS, and AR2 mice exhibit causative molecular changes that occur in ALS. We discuss the contributors to ADAR2 downregulation and TDP-43 pathology in AR2 mouse motor neurons. We describe mechanisms of exaggerated Ca(2+) influx amelioration via AMPA receptors, which is neuroprotective in ADAR2-deficient motor neurons with normalization of TDP-43 pathology in AR2 mice. Development of drugs to treat diseases requires appropriate animal models and a sensitive method of evaluating efficacy. Therefore, normalization of disrupted intracellular environments resulting from ADAR2 downregulation may be a therapeutic target for ALS.

In the absence of the active editing enzymes ADAR1 or ADAR2 (also known as ADAR and ADARB1, respectively), mice fail to survive until adulthood. Nuclear A-to-I editing of neuronal transcripts is regulated during brain development, with low levels of editing in the embryo and a dramatic increase after birth. Yet, little is known about the mechanisms that regulate editing during development. Here, we demonstrate lower levels of ADAR2 in the nucleus of immature neurons than in mature neurons. We show that importin-α4 (encoded by Kpna3), which increases during neuronal maturation, interacts with ADAR2 and contributes to the editing efficiency by bringing it into the nucleus. Moreover, we detect an increased number of interactions between ADAR2 and the nuclear isomerase Pin1 as neurons mature, which contribute to ADAR2 protein stability.

In humans, it is carried out by no less than three major adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs): ADAR1-p150, ADAR1-p110, and ADAR2. However, the first two derive from alternative splicing, so that it is currently impossible to delete ADAR1-p110 without also knocking out ADAR1-p150 expression. Furthermore, the expression levels of ADARs varies wildly among cell types, and no study has systematically explored the effect of each of these isoforms on the cell transcriptome. In this study, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP)-sequencing on overexpressed ADAR isoforms tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP) shows that each ADAR is associated with a specific set of differentially expressed genes, and that they each bind to distinct set of RNA targets.

Recently, A-to-I RNA editing, catalyzed by adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs), was found to be aberrantly regulated during tumorigenesis. We previously reported that ADAR2 was downregulated in ESCC but its role was unclear. Thus, we report here that overexpression of ADAR2 can induce apoptosis in ESCC cell lines and inhibit tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. ADAR2 knockdown inhibited apoptosis in ADAR2 highly expressing tumor cells. RNA-seq assay showed that ADAR2, not ADAR1 or active-site-mutated ADAR2, could edit insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7 (IGFBP7) mRNA in ESCC. IGFBP7 knockdown or ADAR2 catalytic activity destruction abolished the pro-apoptotic function of ADAR2. Mechanistically, RNA editing may stabilize IGFBP7 protein by changing the protease recognition site of matriptase and this is essential for IGFBP7 to induce apoptosis. Western blotting revealed that ADAR2 overexpression could induce IGFBP7-dependent inhibition of Akt signaling. Thus, our data indicate that ADAR2 suppresses tumor growth and induces apoptosis by editing and stabilizing IGFBP7 in ESCC, and this may represent a novel therapeutic target for treating ESCC.",2017 Feb,Int J Oncol. 2017 Feb;50(2):622-630. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2016.3823.

Dysregulation or mutations that compromise the efficacy of A to I editing results in neurological disorders and a shorten life span. These reactions are catalyzed by adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs), which hydrolytically deaminate adenosines in regions of duplex RNA. Because inosine mimics guanosine in hydrogen bonding, this prolific RNA editing alters the sequence and structural information in the RNA landscape. Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS) is a severe childhood autoimmune disease that is one of a broader set of inherited disorders characterized by constitutive upregulation of type I interferon (IFN) referred to as type I interferonopathies. AGS is caused by mutations in multiple genes whose protein products, including ADAR1, are all involved in nucleic acid metabolism or sensing. The recent crystal structures of human ADAR2 deaminase domain complexed with duplex RNA substrates enabled modeling of how AGS causing mutations may influence RNA binding and catalysis.

Since adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing has recently emerged as a driver of cancer progression, genomic amplification combined with inflammatory cytokine activation of ADAR1 could stimulate MM progression and therapeutic resistance. Here, we report that high ADAR1 RNA expression correlates with reduced patient survival rates in the MMRF CoMMpass data set. Expression of wild-type, but not mutant, ADAR1 enhances Alu-dependent editing and transcriptional activity of GLI1, a Hedgehog (Hh) pathway transcriptional activator and self-renewal agonist, and promotes immunomodulatory drug resistance in vitro.

29017946,Cloning and expression of Malabar grouper (Epinephelus malabaricus) ADAR1 gene in response to immune stimulants and nervous necrosis virus.,"ADARs are RNA editing catalysts that bind double-stranded RNA and convert adenosine to inosine, a process that can lead to destabilization of dsRNA structures and suppression of mRNA translation. In mammals, ADAR1 genes are involved in various cellular pathways, including interferon (IFN)-mediated response. However, the function of fish ADAR1 remains unclear. We report here the cloning of ADAR1 in Malabar grouper (Epinephelus malabaricus) (MgADAR1) and its response to various immune stimulants. The MgADAR1 cDNA is 5371-bp long, consisting of an open reading frame encoding a putative protein of 1381 amino acids, a 235-nt 5'-terminal untranslated region (UTR), and a 990-nt 3'-UTR. The deduced amino acid sequence exhibits signature features of a chitin synthesis regulation domain, two Z-DNA-binding domains (Z alpha), three dsRNA binding motifs (DSRM) and one tRNA-specific and dsRNA adenosine deaminase domain (ADEAMc). MgADAR1 mRNA expressed ubiquitously in tissues of healthy Malabar grouper, with elevated levels in the brain, gills and eyes. In response to poly (I: C), the MgADAR1 mRNA level was significantly up-regulated in the brain and spleen, but not head kidney. Upon nervous necrosis virus (NNV) infection the level of MgADAR1 increased in the brain, whereas Mx increased in the brain, spleen and head kidney. Induction of MgADAR1 by poly (I: C) and NNV was also observed in vitro. Additionally, the expression of MgADAR1 was upregulated by recombinant grouper IFN in grouper cells. These data indicate an intricate interplay between ADAR1 and NNV infection in grouper as MgADAR1 might be regulated in a tissue-specific manner.",2017 Dec,Fish Shellfish Immunol. 2017 Dec;71:116-126. doi: 10.1016/j.fsi.2017.09.080.

In recent years, several new monogenic disorders with a lupus-like phenotype have been described. These include forms that affect nucleic acid repair, degradation and sensing (TREX1, DNASE1L3), the type I interferon (IFN) pathway (SAMHD1, RNASEH2ABC, ADAR1, IFIH1, ISG15, ACP5, TMEM173) and B cell development checkpoints (PRKCD; RAG2).

28484266,RNA editing signature during myeloid leukemia cell differentiation.,"Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) are key proteins for hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal and for survival of differentiating progenitor cells. However, their specific role in myeloid cell maturation has been poorly investigated. Here we show that ADAR1 is present at basal level in the primary myeloid leukemia cells obtained from patients at diagnosis as well as in myeloid U-937 and THP1 cell lines and its expression correlates with the editing levels. Upon phorbol-myristate acetate or Vitamin D3/granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-driven differentiation, both ADAR1 and ADAR2 enzymes are upregulated, with a concomitant global increase of A-to-I RNA editing. ADAR1 silencing caused an editing decrease at specific ADAR1 target genes, without, however, interfering with cell differentiation or with ADAR2 activity. Remarkably, ADAR2 is absent in the undifferentiated cell stage, due to its elimination through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, being strongly upregulated at the end of the differentiation process. Of note, peripheral blood monocytes display editing events at the selected targets similar to those found in differentiated cell lines. Taken together, the data indicate that ADAR enzymes play important and distinct roles in myeloid cells.",2017 Dec,Leukemia. 2017 Dec;31(12):2824-2832. doi: 10.1038/leu.2017.134.

28984845,Site-directed RNA editing by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA for correction of the genetic code in gene therapy.,"Site-directed RNA editing is an important technique for correcting gene sequences and ultimately tuning protein function. In this study, we engineered the deaminase domain of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR1) and the MS2 system to target-specific adenosines, with the goal of correcting G-to-A mutations at the RNA level. For this purpose, the ADAR1 deaminase domain was fused downstream of the RNA-binding protein MS2, which has affinity for the MS2 RNA. To direct editing to specific targets, we designed guide RNAs complementary to target RNAs. The guide RNAs directed the ADAR1 deaminase to the desired editing site, where it converted adenosine to inosine. To provide proof of principle, we used an allele of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) bearing a mutation at the 58th amino acid (TGG), encoding Trp, into an amber (TAG) or ochre (TAA) stop codon. In HEK-293 cells, our system could convert stop codons to read-through codons, thereby turning on fluorescence. We confirmed the specificity of editing at the DNA level by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and sequencing, and at the protein level by western blotting. The editing efficiency of this enzyme system was ~5%. We believe that this system could be used to treat genetic diseases resulting from G-to-A point mutations.",2017 Dec,Gene Ther. 2017 Dec;24(12):779-786. doi: 10.1038/gt.2017.90.

29030706,Rare ADAR and RNASEH2B variants and a type I interferon signature in glioma and prostate carcinoma risk and tumorigenesis.,"In search of novel germline alterations predisposing to tumors, in particular to gliomas, we studied a family with two brothers affected by anaplastic gliomas, and their father and paternal great-uncle diagnosed with prostate carcinoma. In this family, whole-exome sequencing yielded rare, simultaneously heterozygous variants in the Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS) genes ADAR and RNASEH2B co-segregating with the tumor phenotype. AGS is a genetically induced inflammatory disease particularly of the brain, which has not been associated with a consistently increased cancer risk to date. By targeted sequencing, we identified novel ADAR and RNASEH2B variants, and a 3- to 17-fold frequency increase of the AGS mutations ADAR,c.577C>G;p.(P193A) and RNASEH2B,c.529G>A;p.(A177T) in the germline of familial glioma patients as well as in test and validation cohorts of glioblastomas and prostate carcinomas versus ethnicity-matched controls, whereby rare RNASEH2B variants were significantly more frequent in familial glioma patients. Tumors with ADAR or RNASEH2B variants recapitulated features of AGS, such as calcification and increased type I interferon expression. Patients carrying ADAR or RNASEH2B variants showed upregulation of interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) transcripts in peripheral blood as seen in AGS. An increased ISG expression was also induced by ADAR and RNASEH2B variants in tumor cells and was blocked by the JAK inhibitor Ruxolitinib.

Identification of RNA-specific adenosine deaminase 1 (ADAR1) gene results in DSH. This study was mainly to explore the pathogenic mutation of ADAR1 gene and provide genetics counselling and prenatal diagnostic testing for childbearing individuals.Mutational analysis of ADAR1 gene was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and electrophoretic separation of PCR products by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis. The coding exons and intron/exon flanking regions followed by bidirectional sequencing was performed on all participants.

His mother suffered from the DSH also owns the same mutation. This mutation, however, is not identified in the unaffected members in this family and those 200 normal controls. In summary, this new mutation Leu1052Pro reported here is pathogenic and detrimental for DSH.

28575488,A deep boosting based approach for capturing the sequence binding preferences of RNA-binding proteins from high-throughput CLIP-seq data.,"Characterizing the binding behaviors of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) is important for understanding their functional roles in gene expression regulation. However, current high-throughput experimental methods for identifying RBP targets, such as CLIP-seq and RNAcompete, usually suffer from the false negative issue. Here, we develop a deep boosting based machine learning approach, called DeBooster, to accurately model the binding sequence preferences and identify the corresponding binding targets of RBPs from CLIP-seq data. Comprehensive validation tests have shown that DeBooster can outperform other state-of-the-art approaches in RBP target prediction. In addition, we have demonstrated that DeBooster may provide new insights into understanding the regulatory functions of RBPs, including the binding effects of the RNA helicase MOV10 on mRNA degradation, the potentially different ADAR1 binding behaviors related to its editing activity, as well as the antagonizing effect of RBP binding on miRNA repression. Moreover, DeBooster may provide an effective index to investigate the effect of pathogenic mutations in RBP binding sites, especially those related to splicing events. We expect that DeBooster will be widely applied to analyze large-scale CLIP-seq experimental data and can provide a practically useful tool for novel biological discoveries in understanding the regulatory mechanisms of RBPs.

Although much research has been performed at genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic level, there is still a significant gap in the metabolomic studies of EC. In order to gain insights into altered metabolic pathways in the onset and progression of EC carcinogenesis, we used high resolution mass spectrometry to characterize the metabolomic and lipidomic profile of 39 human EC and 17 healthy endometrial tissue samples. Several pathways including lipids, Kynurenine pathway, endocannabinoids signaling pathway and the RNA editing pathway were found to be dysregulated in EC. The dysregulation of the RNA editing pathway was further investigated in an independent set of 183 human EC tissues and matched controls, using orthogonal approaches. We found that ADAR2 is overexpressed in EC and that the increase in expression positively correlates with the aggressiveness of the tumor. Furthermore, silencing of ADAR2 in three EC cell lines resulted in a decreased proliferation rate, increased apoptosis, and reduced migration capabilities in vitro. Taken together, our results suggest that ADAR2 functions as an oncogene in endometrial carcinogenesis and could be a potential target for improving EC treatment strategies.",2017 Aug 18,Sci Rep. 2017 Aug 18;7(1):8803. doi: 10.1038/s41598-017-09169-2.,"['Altadill T', 'Dowdy TM', 'Gill K', 'Reques A', 'Menon SS', 'Moiola CP', 'Lopez-Gil C', 'Coll E', 'Matias-Guiu X', 'Cabrera S', 'Garcia A', 'Reventos J', 'Byers SW', 'Gil-Moreno A', 'Cheema AK', 'Colas E']",False

Here, for the first time, we looked for both editing of isolated sites and clustered, non-specific sites in a basal metazoan, the coral Acropora millepora during spawning event, in order to reveal its editing pattern. We found that the coral editome resembles the mammalian one: it contains more than 500,000 sites, virtually all of which are clustered in non-coding regions that are enriched for predicted dsRNA structures. RNA editing levels were increased during spawning and increased further still in newly released gametes.

27701772,"Effects of an alpha1A/D-adrenoceptor antagonist, naftopidil, and a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor, tadalafil, on urinary bladder remodeling in rats with spinal cord injury.","AIMS: In order to clarify whether an alpha1A/D-adrenoceptor (α(1) A/D-AR) antagonist, naftopidil, or a phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor, tadalafil, prevents bladder wall remodeling after spinal cord injury (SCI), we examined the bladder and urethral activity as well as ischemic and fibrotic changes in the bladder using SCI rats with or without naftopidil or tadalafil treatment. METHODS: Adult female Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups: (1) normal (spinal cord intact); (2) vehicle SCI; (3) naftopidil SCI; and (4) tadalafil SCI groups. In SCI groups, rats underwent Th9-10 spinal cord transection followed by oral application of vehicle, naftopidil (20 mg/kg/day) or tadalafil (2 mg/kg/day) for 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks. Bladder and urethral pressures, mRNA levels of fibrosis-related molecules and ischemia markers and the composition of bladder collagen and elastin were evaluated. RESULTS: Naftopidil treatment reduced the upregulation of mRNA levels of ischemia and fibrosis markers at the early phase of SCI, and ameliorated the decrease of bladder compliance and voiding efficiency, and the increase of urethral pressure and collagen concentration in the bladder wall at the late phase of SCI. Tadalafil treatment reduced the upregulation of mRNA levels of fibrosis markers, the decrease of bladder compliance and the increase of collagen concentration at the late phase of SCI. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that naftopidil and tadalafil treatments improved the bladder remodeling shown by increased bladder collagen contents after SCI in a different time course. Thus, these treatments could be effective for reducing the SCI-related tissue remodeling in the bladder. Neurourol.

ADAR1 (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA), an enzyme that binds and edits double-stranded RNAs, exhibits immune regulatory properties. Whether ADAR1 is involved in the pathophysiology of sepsis is unclear. In the present study, we used human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVECs) as an in vitro model system to investigate the roles of ADAR1 in interleukin (IL)-1β-induced endothelial activation. We found that stimulation with IL-1β caused opposite changes in the expression of ADAR1 and the adherence molecules VCAM-1 and ICAM-1. ADAR1 overexpression reduced while ADAR1 knockdown enhanced IL-1β-induced HUVEC activation as assessed by ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression and THP-1 monocyte recruitment. Furthermore, ADAR1 was confirmed to be a direct target of miR-143 in HUVECs by a luciferase reporter assay, and miR-143 overexpression promoted while miR-143 knockdown inhibited HUVEC activation by IL-1β. In addition, ADAR1 overexpression prevented the enhancement effects of miR-143 overexpression on IL-1β-induced HUVEC activation. Our mechanistic studies revealed that ADAR1 overexpression reduced while ADAR1 knockdown enhanced PKR, IκBα, and NFκB phosphorylation induced by IL-1β. In addition, blocking NFκB signaling with the specific NFκB inhibitor PDTC (pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate) prevented IL-1β-induced HUVEC activation enhanced by ADAR1 knockdown. Collectively, these data indicated that ADAR1 is targeted by miR-143 to regulate IL-1β-induced HUVEC activation, and the NFκB pathway acts as the downstream mediator of ADAR1. In conclusion, miR-143 and ADAR1 may serve as therapeutic targets for sepsis.",2017 Aug,Int J Biochem Cell Biol. 2017 Aug;89:25-33. doi: 10.1016/j.biocel.2017.05.021.

28855414,Nuclear and mitochondrial RNA editing systems have opposite effects on protein diversity.,"RNA editing can yield protein products that differ from those directly encoded by genomic DNA. This process is pervasive in the mitochondria of many eukaryotes, where it predominantly results in the restoration of ancestral protein sequences. Nuclear mRNAs in metazoans also undergo editing (adenosine-to-inosine or 'A-to-I' substitutions), and most of these edits appear to be nonadaptive 'misfirings' of adenosine deaminases. However, recent analysis of cephalopod transcriptomes found that many editing sites are shared by anciently divergent lineages within this group, suggesting they play some adaptive role. Recent discoveries have also revealed that some fungi have an independently evolved A-to-I editing mechanism, resulting in extensive recoding of their nuclear mRNAs. Here, phylogenetic comparisons were used to determine whether RNA editing generally restores ancestral protein sequences or creates derived variants. Unlike in mitochondrial systems, RNA editing in metazoan and fungal nuclear transcripts overwhelmingly leads to novel sequences not found in inferred ancestral proteins. Even for the subset of RNA editing sites shared by deeply divergent cephalopod lineages, the primary effect of nuclear editing is an increase-not a decrease-in protein divergence. These findings suggest fundamental differences in the forces responsible for the evolution of RNA editing in nuclear versus mitochondrial systems.",2017 Aug,Biol Lett. 2017 Aug;13(8):20170314. doi: 10.1098/rsbl.2017.0314.,['Sloan DB'],False

Here, we show that ADARs also react with DNA/RNA hybrid duplexes. Hybrid substrates are deaminated efficiently by ADAR deaminase domains at dA-C mismatches and with E to Q mutations in the base flipping loop of the enzyme. For a long, perfectly matched hybrid, deamination is more efficient with full length ADAR2 than its isolated deaminase domain. Guide RNA strands for directed DNA editing by ADAR were used to target six different 2΄-deoxyadenosines in the M13 bacteriophage ssDNA genome. DNA editing efficiencies varied depending on the sequence context of the editing site consistent with known sequence preferences for ADARs. These observations suggest the reaction within DNA/RNA hybrids may be a natural function of human ADARs. In addition, this work sets the stage for development of a new class of genome editing tools based on directed deamination of 2΄-deoxyadenosines in DNA/RNA hybrids.",2017 Apr 7,Nucleic Acids Res. 2017 Apr 7;45(6):3369-3377. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkx050.,"['Zheng Y', 'Lorenzo C', 'Beal PA']",True
28355180,DHX9 suppresses RNA processing defects originating from the Alu invasion of the human genome.,"Transposable elements are viewed as 'selfish genetic elements', yet they contribute to gene regulation and genome evolution in diverse ways. More than half of the human genome consists of transposable elements. Alu elements belong to the short interspersed nuclear element (SINE) family of repetitive elements, and with over 1 million insertions they make up more than 10% of the human genome. Despite their abundance and the potential evolutionary advantages they confer, Alu elements can be mutagenic to the host as they can act as splice acceptors, inhibit translation of mRNAs and cause genomic instability. Alu elements are the main targets of the RNA-editing enzyme ADAR and the formation of Alu exons is suppressed by the nuclear ribonucleoprotein HNRNPC, but the broad effect of massive secondary structures formed by inverted-repeat Alu elements on RNA processing in the nucleus remains unknown. Here we show that DHX9, an abundant nuclear RNA helicase, binds specifically to inverted-repeat Alu elements that are transcribed as parts of genes. Loss of DHX9 leads to an increase in the number of circular-RNA-producing genes and amount of circular RNAs, translational repression of reporters containing inverted-repeat Alu elements, and transcriptional rewiring (the creation of mostly nonsensical novel connections between exons) of susceptible loci. Biochemical purifications of DHX9 identify the interferon-inducible isoform of ADAR (p150), but not the constitutively expressed ADAR isoform (p110), as an RNA-independent interaction partner. Co-depletion of ADAR and DHX9 augments the double-stranded RNA accumulation defects, leading to increased circular RNA production, revealing a functional link between these two enzymes. Our work uncovers an evolutionarily conserved function of DHX9. We propose that it acts as a nuclear RNA resolvase that neutralizes the immediate threat posed by transposon insertions and allows these elements to evolve as tools for the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression.",2017 Apr 6,Nature. 2017 Apr 6;544(7648):115-119. doi: 10.1038/nature21715.

Editing is enriched in the nervous system, affecting molecules pertinent for excitability and neuronal morphology. The genomic sequence flanking editing sites is highly conserved, suggesting that the process confers a selective advantage.

The significance of editing within non-coding regions of RNA is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that association of ADAR2 with RNA stabilizes a subset of transcripts. ADAR2 interacts with and edits the 3΄UTR of nuclear-retained Cat2 transcribed nuclear RNA (Ctn RNA). In absence of ADAR2, the abundance and half-life of Ctn RNA are significantly reduced. Furthermore, ADAR2-mediated stabilization of Ctn RNA occurred in an editing-independent manner. Unedited Ctn RNA shows enhanced interaction with the RNA-binding proteins HuR and PARN [Poly(A) specific ribonuclease deadenylase]. HuR and PARN destabilize Ctn RNA in absence of ADAR2, indicating that ADAR2 stabilizes Ctn RNA by antagonizing its degradation by PARN and HuR. Transcriptomic analysis identified other RNAs that are regulated by a similar mechanism. In summary, we identify a regulatory mechanism whereby ADAR2 enhances target RNA stability by limiting the interaction of RNA-destabilizing proteins with their cognate substrates.",2017 Apr 20,Nucleic Acids Res. 2017 Apr 20;45(7):4189-4201. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkw1304.,"['Anantharaman A', 'Tripathi V', 'Khan A', 'Yoon JH', 'Singh DK', 'Gholamalamdari O', 'Guang S', 'Ohlson J', 'Wahlstedt H', 'Öhman M', 'Jantsch MF', 'Conrad NK', 'Ma J', 'Gorospe M', 'Prasanth SG', 'Prasanth KV']",True

The crosslinking formation increased the thermodynamic stability without disturbing the natural conformation of dsRNA. In addition, a competitive binding experiment with the duplex RNA binding enzyme, ADAR2, showed the crosslinked dsRNA bound the protein with nearly the same binding affinity as the natural dsRNA, confirming that it has finely preserved the natural traits of duplex RNA.",2017 Apr 1,Bioorg Med Chem. 2017 Apr 1;25(7):2191-2199. doi: 10.1016/j.bmc.2017.02.034.

28195308,Ca(2+) -permeable AMPA receptors associated with epileptogenesis of hypothalamic hamartoma.,"Hypothalamic hamartoma (HH), composed of neurons and glia without apparent cytologic abnormalities, is a rare developmental malformation in humans. Patients with HH often have characteristic medically refractory gelastic seizures, and intrinsic epileptogenesis within the lesions has been speculated. Herein we provide evidence to suggest that in HH neurons, Ca(2+) permeability through α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors is aberrantly elevated. In needle biopsy specimens of HH tissue, field potential recordings demonstrated spontaneous epileptiform activities similar to those observed in other etiologically distinct epileptogenic tissues. In HH, however, these activities were clearly abolished by application of Joro Spider Toxin (JSTX), a specific inhibitor of the Ca(2+) -permeable AMPA receptor. Consistent with these physiologic findings, the neuronal nuclei showed disappearance of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 2 (ADAR2) immunoreactivity. Furthermore, examination of glutamate receptor 2 (GluA2) messenger RNA (mRNA) revealed that editing efficiency at the glutamine/arginine site was significantly low. These results suggest that neurons in HH may bear Ca(2+) -permeable AMPA receptors due to dislocation of ADAR2.",2017 Apr,Epilepsia. 2017 Apr;58(4):e59-e63. doi: 10.1111/epi.13700.

28217931,How do ADARs bind RNA? New protein-RNA structures illuminate substrate recognition by the RNA editing ADARs.,"Deamination of adenosine in RNA to form inosine has wide ranging consequences on RNA function including amino acid substitution to give proteins not encoded in the genome. What determines which adenosines in an mRNA are subject to this modification reaction? The answer lies in an understanding of the mechanism and substrate recognition properties of adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADARs). Our recent publication of X-ray crystal structures of the human ADAR2 deaminase domain bound to RNA editing substrates shed considerable light on how the catalytic domains of these enzymes bind RNA and promote adenosine deamination. Here we review in detail the deaminase domain-RNA contact surfaces and present models of how full length ADARs, bearing double stranded RNA-binding domains (dsRBDs) and deaminase domains, could process naturally occurring substrate RNAs.",2017 Apr,Bioessays. 2017 Apr;39(4):10.1002/bies.201600187. doi: 10.1002/bies.201600187.

28215278,Nucleic Acid Immunity.,"Organisms throughout biology need to maintain the integrity of their genome. From bacteria to vertebrates, life has established sophisticated mechanisms to detect and eliminate foreign genetic material or to restrict its function and replication. Tremendous progress has been made in the understanding of these mechanisms which keep foreign or unwanted nucleic acids from viruses or phages in check. Mechanisms reach from restriction-modification systems and CRISPR/Cas in bacteria and archaea to RNA interference and immune sensing of nucleic acids, altogether integral parts of a system which is now appreciated as nucleic acid immunity. With inherited receptors and acquired sequence information, nucleic acid immunity comprises innate and adaptive components. Effector functions include diverse nuclease systems, intrinsic activities to directly restrict the function of foreign nucleic acids (e.g., PKR, ADAR1, IFIT1), and extrinsic pathways to alert the immune system and to elicit cytotoxic immune responses. These effects act in concert to restrict viral replication and to eliminate virus-infected cells. The principles of nucleic acid immunity are highly relevant for human disease. Besides its essential contribution to antiviral defense and restriction of endogenous retroelements, dysregulation of nucleic acid immunity can also lead to erroneous detection and response to self nucleic acids then causing sterile inflammation and autoimmunity. Even mechanisms of nucleic acid immunity which are not established in vertebrates are relevant for human disease when they are present in pathogens such as bacteria, parasites, or helminths or in pathogen-transmitting organisms such as insects. This review aims to provide an overview of the diverse mechanisms of nucleic acid immunity which mostly have been looked at separately in the past and to integrate them under the framework nucleic acid immunity as a basic principle of life, the understanding of which has great potential to advance medicine.",2017,Adv Immunol. 2017;133:121-169. doi: 10.1016/bs.ai.2016.11.001.

28472150,Both MAPK and STAT3 signal transduction pathways are necessary for IL-6-dependent hepatic stellate cells activation.,"BACKGROUND: During liver injury, hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) can undergo activation and transform into alpha-smooth muscle actin (αSMA)-expressing contractile myofibroblast-like cells, leading to deposition of excessive scar matrix. We have recently demonstrated that depletion of adenosine deaminase acting on double-stranded RNA (ADAR1) from mouse hepatocytes leads to HSC activation and induction of inflammation and hepatic fibrosis that is mediated by interleukin 6 (IL-6). Our aim was to identify and characterize the molecular pathways involved in the direct, inflammation-independent activation of HSCs by IL-6. METHODS: Primary HSCs were isolated from mouse livers. mRNA levels of αSMA and Col1a were analyzed using qRT-PCR. Protein levels of αSMA, MAPK, p-MAPK, p38, p-p38, STAT3 and p-STAT3 were assessed by Western Blot analysis. The effect of specific signal transduction pathway inhibitors (i.e., SB203580 (P-38 inhibitor), U0126 (MAPK inhibitor), S3I-201 (STAT3 inhibitor) and Ruxolitinib (Jak1/2 inhibitor)) was also studied. RESULTS: Primary HSCs treated with IL-6 demonstrated upregulation of αSMA and Col1a mRNA levels as well as increased αSMA protein levels. Moreover, the phenotypic transition of quiescent HSCs toward myofibroblast-like cells was noted upon administration of IL-6 and not in untreated samples. In addition, the phosphorylation levels of p38, MAPK and STAT3 increased 30 minutes after treatment, and was followed by a decline in the phosphorylation levels 2-4 hours post-treatment. However, addition of specific signal transduction pathway inhibitors curbed this effect, and resulted in αSMA and Col1a expression levels similar to those measured in untreated control samples. CONCLUSION: IL-6 can directly induce the transition of HSCs toward myofibroblast-like cells. The effect is mediated by the activation of both MAPK and JAK/STAT signaling pathways. Elimination of either MAPK or JAK/STAT signaling pathways inhibits HSC stimulation. These results might pave the road toward the development of potential therapeutic interventions for hepatic fibrosis.",2017,PLoS One. 2017 May 4;12(5):e0176173. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0176173. eCollection 2017.,"['Kagan P', 'Sultan M', 'Tachlytski I', 'Safran M', 'Ben-Ari Z']",True
28520763,Genome-wide gene expression array identifies novel genes related to disease severity and excessive daytime sleepiness in patients with obstructive sleep apnea.,"We aimed to identify novel molecular associations between chronic intermittent hypoxia with re-oxygenation and adverse consequences in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). We analyzed gene expression profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 48 patients with sleep-disordered breathing stratified into four groups: primary snoring (PS), moderate to severe OSA (MSO), very severe OSA (VSO), and very severe OSA patients on long-term continuous positive airway pressure treatment (VSOC). Comparisons of the microarray gene expression data identified eight genes up-regulated with OSA and down-regulated with CPAP treatment, and five genes down-regulated with OSA and up-regulated with CPAP treatment. Protein expression levels of two genes related to endothelial tight junction (AMOT P130, and PLEKHH3), and three genes related to anti-or pro-apoptosis (BIRC3, ADAR1 P150, and LGALS3) were all increased in the VSO group, while AMOT P130 was further increased, and PLEKHH3, BIRC3, and ADAR1 P150 were all decreased in the VSOC group. Subgroup analyses revealed that AMOT P130 protein expression was increased in OSA patients with excessive daytime sleepiness, BIRC3 protein expression was decreased in OSA patients with hypertension, and LGALS3 protein expression was increased in OSA patients with chronic kidney disease. In vitro short-term intermittent hypoxia with re-oxygenation experiment showed immediate over-expression of ADAR1 P150. In conclusion, we identified a novel association between AMOT/PLEKHH3/BIRC3/ADAR1/LGALS3 over-expressions and high severity index in OSA patients. AMOT and GALIG may constitute an important determinant for the development of hypersomnia and kidney injury, respectively, while BIRC3 may play a protective role in the development of hypertension.",2017,PLoS One. 2017 May 17;12(5):e0176575. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0176575. eCollection 2017.,"['Chen YC', 'Chen KD', 'Su MC', 'Chin CH', 'Chen CJ', 'Liou CW', 'Chen TW', 'Chang YC', 'Huang KT', 'Wang CC', 'Wang TY', 'Chang JC', 'Lin YY', 'Zheng YX', 'Lin MC', 'Hsiao CC']",False
28046052,Integrative Analysis of Immunological Data to Explore Chronic Immune T-Cell Activation in Successfully Treated HIV Patients.,"OBJECTIVES: To unravel the complex relationships between cytomegalovirus-induced-, autoimmune-induced responses, microbial translocation and chronic immune activation (CIA) in successfully treated HIV-infected patients and to explore the mediating role of alpha-interferon in these processes. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study nested in the ANRS CO3 Aquitaine Cohort, a prospective hospital-based cohort of HIV-1-infected patients in South-Western France. METHODS: Patients initiated antiretroviral therapy between 2005 and 2008 and were treated with sustained virological suppression for at least two years. CIA was defined by the percentage of HLA-DR+/CD38+ among CD8+T-cells. Integrative analyses were performed using structural equation modelling (SEM). RESULTS: The main analysis was performed in 57 HLA-A*0201 positive patients, due to availability of percentages of actin-, vimentin-, lamin-specific CD8+T-cells (HLA-A2-restricted tests) to further characterize autoimmune response. Cytomegalovirus-induced response was assessed by Quantiferon and pp-65 ELISPOT. SEM revealed a direct effect of cytomegalovirus-induced response on CIA (standardized estimate βstd = 0.56, p-value = 0.0004). The effect of autoimmune-induced response on CIA was indirect through alpha-interferon pathway, assessed by expression levels of 5 alpha-interferon-stimulated genes ADAR, ISG15, IFIT1, Mx1 and OAS1 (effect of autoimmune response on alpha-interferon: βstd = 0.36, p-value = 0.0401; effect of alpha-interferon on CIA: βstd = 0.39, p-value = 0.0044). There was no direct effect of autoimmune-induced response on CIA (p-value = 0.3169). Microbial translocation as measured by 16SrDNA and sCD14 in plasma was not associated with CIA. Results were consistent in 142 patients in whom cytomegalovirus and auto-immunity responses were measured by Quantiferon and anti-nuclear antibodies, respectively. All analyses performed in HLA-A*0201 positive patients and in the overall population revealed a significant effect of IFN-α latent variable on CIA. CONCLUSION: The role of cytomegalovirus-induced response on CIA was confirmed as well as the involvement of alpha-interferon on CIA. The indirect effect of auto-immunity response on CIA revealed through the alpha-interferon pathway requires further investigation to confirm the potential role of auto-immunity for CIA in HIV-infected patients.",2017,PLoS One. 2017 Jan 3;12(1):e0169164. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0169164. eCollection 2017.,"['Picat MQ', 'Pellegrin I', 'Bitard J', 'Wittkop L', 'Proust-Lima C', 'Liquet B', 'Moreau JF', 'Bonnet F', 'Blanco P', 'Thiébaut R']",False
28275585,Mutational Pressure in Zika Virus: Local ADAR-Editing Areas Associated with Pauses in Translation and Replication.,"Zika virus (ZIKV) spread led to the recent medical health emergency of international concern. Understanding the variations in virus system is of utmost need. Using available complete sequences of ZIKV we estimated directions of mutational pressure along the length of consensus sequences of three lineages of the virus. Results showed that guanine usage is growing in ZIKV RNA plus strand due to adenine to guanine transitions, while adenine usage is growing due to cytosine to adenine transversions. Especially high levels of guanine have been found in two-fold degenerated sites of certain areas of RNA plus strand with high amount of secondary structure. The usage of cytosine in two-fold degenerated sites shows direct dependence on the amount of secondary structure in 52% (consensus sequence of East African ZIKV lineage)-32% (consensus sequence of epidemic strains) of the length of RNA minus strand. These facts are the evidences of ADAR-editing of both strands of ZIKV genome during pauses in replication. RNA plus strand can also be edited by ADAR during pauses in translation caused by the appearance of groups of rare codons. According to our results, RNA minus strand of epidemic ZIKV strain has lower number of points in which polymerase can be stalled (allowing ADAR-editing) compared to other strains. The data on preferable directions of mutational pressure in epidemic ZIKV strain is useful for future vaccine development and understanding the evolution of new strains.",2017,Front Cell Infect Microbiol. 2017 Feb 22;7:44. doi: 10.3389/fcimb.2017.00044. eCollection 2017.,"['Khrustalev VV', 'Khrustaleva TA', 'Sharma N', 'Giri R']",False

29541325,Localised transmission hotspots of a typhoid fever outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo.,"INTRODUCTION: In a semi-urban setting in the Democratic Republic of Congo, this study aims to understand the dynamic of a typhoid fever (TF) outbreak and to assess: a) the existence of hot spots for TF transmission and b) the difference between typhoid cases identified within those hot spots and the general population in relation to socio-demographic characteristics, sanitation practice, and sources of drinking water. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of TF outbreaks in 2011 in Kikwit, DRC using microbiological analysis of water sources and a structured interview questionnaire. RESULTS: There were a total of 1430 reported TF cases. The outbreak's epidemic curve shows earliest and highest peak attack rates (AR) in three military camps located in Kikwit (Ebeya 3.2%; Ngubu 3.0%; and Nsinga 2.2%) compared to an average peak AR of 0.6% in other affected areas. A total 320 cases from the military camps and the high burden health areas were interviewed. Typhoid cases in the military camps shared a latrine with more than one family (P<0.02). All tap water sources in both the military camps and general population were found to be highly contaminated with faecal coliforms. CONCLUSION: The role of military camps in Kikwit as early hotspots of TF transmission was likely associated with lower sanitary and hygiene conditions. The proximity of camps to the general population might have been responsible for disseminating TF to the general population. Mapping of cases during an outbreak could be crucial to identify hot spots for transmission and institute corrective measures.",2017,Pan Afr Med J. 2017 Oct 27;28:179. doi: 10.11604/pamj.2017.28.179.10208. eCollection 2017.,"['Ali E', 'Bergh RVD', ""D'hondt R"", 'Kuma-Kuma D', 'Weggheleire A', 'Baudot Y', 'Lambert V', 'Hunter P', 'Zachariah R', 'Maes P']",False
27687780,Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals dynamic changes in A-to-I RNA editome during early human embryogenesis.,"BACKGROUND: A-to-I RNA-editing mediated by ADAR (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA) enzymes that converts adenosine to inosine in RNA sequence can generate mutations and alter gene regulation in metazoans. Previous studies have shown that A-to-I RNA-editing plays vital roles in mouse embryogenesis. However, the RNA-editing activities in early human embryonic development have not been investigated. RESULTS: Here, we characterized genome-wide A-to-I RNA-editing activities during human early embryogenesis by profiling 68 single cells from 29 human embryos spanning from oocyte to morula stages. We demonstrate dynamic changes in genome-wide RNA-editing during early human embryogenesis in a stage-specific fashion. In parallel with ADAR expression level changes, the genome-wide A-to-I RNA-editing levels in cells remained relatively stable until 4-cell stage, but dramatically decreased at 8-cell stage, continually decreased at morula stage. We detected 37 non-synonymously RNA-edited genes, of which 5 were frequently found in cells of multiple embryonic stages. Moreover, we found that A-to-I editings in miRNA-targeted regions of a substantial number of genes preferably occurred in one or two sequential stages. CONCLUSIONS: Our single-cell analysis reveals dynamic changes in genome-wide RNA-editing during early human embryogenesis in a stage-specific fashion, and provides important insights into early human embryogenesis.",2016 Sep 29,BMC Genomics. 2016 Sep 29;17(1):766. doi: 10.1186/s12864-016-3115-2.,"['Qiu S', 'Li W', 'Xiong H', 'Liu D', 'Bai Y', 'Wu K', 'Zhang X', 'Yang H', 'Ma K', 'Hou Y', 'Li B']",True

27485054,Association between targeted somatic mutation (TSM) signatures and HGS-OvCa progression.,"Evidence already exists that the activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID/APOBEC) and the adenosine deaminase (ADAR) families of enzymes are implicated as powerful mutagens in oncogenic processes in many somatic tissues. Each deaminase is identified by the DNA or RNA nucleotide sequence (""motif"") surrounding the nucleotide targeted for deamination. The primary objective of this study is to develop an in silico approach to identify nucleotide sequence changes of the target motifs of key deaminases during oncogenesis. If successful, a secondary objective is to investigate if such changes are associated with disease progression indicators that include disease stage and progression-free survival time. Using a discovery cohort of 194 high-grade serous ovarian adenocarcinoma (HGS-OvCa) exomes, the results confirm the ability of the novel in silico approach used to identify changes in the preferred target motifs for AID, APOBEC3G, APOBEC3B, and ADAR1 during oncogenesis. Using this approach, a set of new cancer-progression associated signatures (C-PASs) were identified. Furthermore, it was found that the C-PAS identified can be used to differentiate between the cohort of patients that remained progression-free for longer than 60 months, from those in which disease progressed within 60 months (sensitivity 95%, specificity 90%). The spectrum of outcomes observed here could provide a foundation for future clinical assessment of susceptibility variants in ovarian, and several other cancers as disease progresses.

The present study focused on the structural and functional characterizations of grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) ADAR2 (CiADAR2) gene. The complete genomic sequence of CiADAR2 is 150,458 bp in length, containing 12 exons and 11 introns. The open reading frame (ORF) of 2100 bp encodes a polypeptide of 699 amino acids (aa) which contains three highly conservative domains - two N-terminal dsRNA binding domains (dsRBDs) and one C-terminal deaminase domain. The predicted crystal structure of CiADAR2 deaminase domain suggested a catalytic center form in the enzyme active site. CiADAR2 mRNA was ubiquitously expressed in the fifteen tested tissues, and was induced post GCRV challenge in spleen and head kidney and C. idella kidney (CIK) cells. The ex vivo expression of CiADAR2 protein was verified by the Flag (tag)-based western blot assay. Antiviral activity assay of CiADAR2 was manifested by the delayed appearance of cytopathic effect (CPE) and inhibition of GCRV yield at 48 h post infection. Furthermore, in CiADAR2 overexpression cells, mRNA expression levels of CiIFN1, CiTLR7 and CiTLR8 were facilitated at different time points after GCRV infection, comparing to those in control group. Taken together, it was indicated that ADAR2 was an antiviral cytokine against GCRV and anti-GCRV function mechanism might involve in the TLR7/8-regulated IFN-signaling.

27614234,Role of Host-Driven Mutagenesis in Determining Genome Evolution of Sigma Virus (DMelSV; Rhabdoviridae) in Drosophila melanogaster.,"Sigma virus (DMelSV) is ubiquitous in natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster. Host-mediated, selective RNA editing of adenosines to inosines (ADAR) may contribute to control of viral infection by preventing transcripts from being transported into the cytoplasm or being translated accurately; or by increasing the viral genomic mutation rate. Previous PCR-based studies showed that ADAR mutations occur in DMelSV at low frequency. Here we use SOLiD(TM) deep sequencing of flies from a single host population from Athens, GA, USA to comprehensively evaluate patterns of sequence variation in DMelSV with respect to ADAR. GA dinucleotides, which are weak targets of ADAR, are strongly overrepresented in the positive strand of the virus, consistent with selection to generate ADAR resistance on this complement of the transient, double-stranded RNA intermediate in replication and transcription. Potential ADAR sites in a worldwide sample of viruses are more likely to be ""resistant"" if the sites do not vary among samples. Either variable sites are less constrained and hence are subject to weaker selection than conserved sites, or the variation is driven by ADAR. We also find evidence of mutations segregating within hosts, hereafter referred to as hypervariable sites. Some of these sites were variable only in one or two flies (i.e., rare); others were shared by four or even all five of the flies (i.e., common). Rare and common hypervariable sites were indistinguishable with respect to susceptibility to ADAR; however, polymorphism in rare sites were more likely to be consistent with the action of ADAR than in common ones, again suggesting that ADAR is deleterious to the virus. Thus, in DMelSV, host mutagenesis is constraining viral evolution both within and between hosts.",2016 Oct 5,Genome Biol Evol. 2016 Oct 5;8(9):2952-2963. doi: 10.1093/gbe/evw212.,"['Piontkivska H', 'Matos LF', 'Paul S', 'Scharfenberg B', 'Farmerie WG', 'Miyamoto MM', 'Wayne ML']",False
27621458,Chromatin-modifying genetic interventions suppress age-associated transposable element activation and extend life span in Drosophila.,"Transposable elements (TEs) are mobile genetic elements, highly enriched in heterochromatin, that constitute a large percentage of the DNA content of eukaryotic genomes. Aging in Drosophila melanogaster is characterized by loss of repressive heterochromatin structure and loss of silencing of reporter genes in constitutive heterochromatin regions. Using next-generation sequencing, we found that transcripts of many genes native to heterochromatic regions and TEs increased with age in fly heads and fat bodies. A dietary restriction regimen, known to extend life span, repressed the age-related increased expression of genes located in heterochromatin, as well as TEs. We also observed a corresponding age-associated increase in TE transposition in fly fat body cells that was delayed by dietary restriction. Furthermore, we found that manipulating genes known to affect heterochromatin structure, including overexpression of Sir2, Su(var)3-9, and Dicer-2, as well as decreased expression of Adar, mitigated age-related increases in expression of TEs. Increasing expression of either Su(var)3-9 or Dicer-2 also led to an increase in life span. Mutation of Dicer-2 led to an increase in DNA double-strand breaks. Treatment with the reverse transcriptase inhibitor 3TC resulted in decreased TE transposition as well as increased life span in TE-sensitized Dicer-2 mutants. Together, these data support the retrotransposon theory of aging, which hypothesizes that epigenetically silenced TEs become deleteriously activated as cellular defense and surveillance mechanisms break down with age. Furthermore, interventions that maintain repressive heterochromatin and preserve TE silencing may prove key to preventing damage caused by TE activation and extending healthy life span.",2016 Oct 4,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2016 Oct 4;113(40):11277-11282. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1604621113.

27782844,Transcriptome-wide effects of inverted SINEs on gene expression and their impact on RNA polymerase II activity.,"BACKGROUND: Short interspersed elements (SINEs) represent the most abundant group of non-long-terminal repeat transposable elements in mammalian genomes. In primates, Alu elements are the most prominent and homogenous representatives of SINEs. Due to their frequent insertion within or close to coding regions, SINEs have been suggested to play a crucial role during genome evolution. Moreover, Alu elements within mRNAs have also been reported to control gene expression at different levels. RESULTS: Here, we undertake a genome-wide analysis of insertion patterns of human Alus within transcribed portions of the genome. Multiple, nearby insertions of SINEs within one transcript are more abundant in tandem orientation than in inverted orientation. Indeed, analysis of transcriptome-wide expression levels of 15 ENCODE cell lines suggests a cis-repressive effect of inverted Alu elements on gene expression. Using reporter assays, we show that the negative effect of inverted SINEs on gene expression is independent of known sensors of double-stranded RNAs. Instead, transcriptional elongation seems impaired, leading to reduced mRNA levels. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that there is a bias against multiple SINE insertions that can promote intramolecular base pairing within a transcript. Moreover, at a genome-wide level, mRNAs harboring inverted SINEs are less expressed than mRNAs harboring single or tandemly arranged SINEs. Finally, we demonstrate a novel mechanism by which inverted SINEs can impact on gene expression by interfering with RNA polymerase II.",2016 Oct 25,Genome Biol. 2016 Oct 25;17(1):220. doi: 10.1186/s13059-016-1083-0.,"['Tajaddod M', 'Tanzer A', 'Licht K', 'Wolfinger MT', 'Badelt S', 'Huber F', 'Pusch O', 'Schopoff S', 'Janisiw M', 'Hofacker I', 'Jantsch MF']",True
27687550,A-to-I RNA editing of the IGFBP7 transcript increases during aging in porcine brain tissues.,"The IGFBP7 gene encodes insulin-like growth factor protein 7. IGFPB7 is involved in diverse biological functions including cell growth regulation, senescence and apoptosis, and also acts as a tumor suppressor in multiple cancers. The IGFBP7 mRNA is subject to A-to-I RNA editing mediated by adenosine deaminases acting on RNA 1 and 2 (ADAR1 and ADAR2). In the current study we have examined molecular characteristics of the porcine IGFBP7 gene, and determined the mRNA editing in different tissues. The A-to-I RNA editing of human IGFBP7 in positions Arg78 and Lys95 was shown to be conserved in the porcine homologue. In addition, a novel editing site was discovered in position Lys97 in the porcine IGFBP7 transcript. A differential editing was demonstrated at the three positions in the IGFBP7 transcript with very high degrees of editing in frontal cortex, cerebellum and lung.

27533598,A-to-I RNA editing independent of ADARs in filamentous fungi.,"ADAR mediated A-to-I RNA editing is thought to be unique to animals and occurs mainly in the non-coding regions. Recently filamentous fungi such as Fusarium graminearum were found to lack orthologs of animal ADARs but have stage-specific A-to-I editing during sexual reproduction. Unlike animals, majority of editing sites are in the coding regions and often result in missense and stop loss changes in fungi. Furthermore, whereas As in RNA stems are targeted by animal ADARs, RNA editing in fungi preferentially targets As in hairpin loops, implying that fungal RNA editing involves mechanisms related to editing of the anticodon loop by ADATs. Identification and characterization of fungal adenosine deaminases and their stage-specific co-factors may be helpful to understand the evolution of human ADARs. Fungi also can be used to study biological functions of missense and stop loss RNA editing events in eukaryotic organisms.",2016 Oct 2,RNA Biol. 2016 Oct 2;13(10):940-945. doi: 10.1080/15476286.2016.1215796.

Deficiency of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 2 (ADAR2), an enzyme that specifically catalyzes GluA2 Q/R site-editing, has been reported in considerable proportions of spinal motor neurons of the majority of sporadic ALS patients. We describe the relationship between GluA2 Q/R site-editing efficiency and FUS-positive inclusions in a patient with FUS(P525L). A 24-year-old woman with ALS presented with basophilic cytoplasmic inclusions, significantly reduced GluA2 Q/R site-editing efficiency in the spinal motor neurons, and markedly decreased ADAR2 mRNA levels. Neuropathologic examination showed that not all spinal motor neurons expressed ADAR2 and revealed FUS-positive cytoplasmic inclusions in motor neurons irrespective of ADAR2 immunoreactivity. There were no phosphorylated transactive response (TAR) DNA-binding protein 43 kDa (TDP-43)-positive inclusions, indicating that there was no tight correlation between ADAR2 deficiency and TDP-43 deposition. ADAR2 deficiency can occur in ALS patients with a FUS(P525L) mutation and is unrelated to the presence of FUS-positive inclusions. FUS-associated ALS may share neurodegenerative characteristics with classical sporadic ALS.",2016 Oct,J Clin Neurosci. 2016 Oct;32:128-9. doi: 10.1016/j.jocn.2015.12.039.

In vivo, ADAR1 is essential for the maintenance of hematopoietic stem/progenitors. Whether other hematopoietic cell types also require ADAR1 has not been assessed. Using erythroid- and myeloid-restricted deletion of Adar1, we demonstrate that ADAR1 is dispensable for myelopoiesis but is essential for normal erythropoiesis. Adar1-deficient erythroid cells display a profound activation of innate immune signaling and high levels of cell death. No changes in microRNA levels were found in ADAR1-deficient erythroid cells. Using an editing-deficient allele, we demonstrate that RNA editing is the essential function of ADAR1 during erythropoiesis. Mapping of adenosine-to-inosine editing in purified erythroid cells identified clusters of hyperedited adenosines located in long 3'-untranslated regions of erythroid-specific transcripts and these are ADAR1-specific editing events.

27383210,Double-stranded-RNA-specific adenosine deaminase 1 (ADAR1) is proposed to contribute to the adaptation of equine infectious anemia virus from horses to donkeys.,"Equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) is a member of the genus Lentivirus of the family Retroviridae. Horses are the most susceptible equids to EIAV infection and are therefore the primary hosts of this virus. In contrast, infected donkeys do not develop clinically active equine infectious anemia (EIA). This phenomenon is similar to what has been observed with HIV-1, which fails to induce AIDS in non-human primates. Interestingly, Shen et al. developed a donkey-tropic pathogenic virus strain (EIAVDV117, DV117) by serially passaging a horse-tropic pathogenic strain, EIAVLN40 (LN40), in donkeys. LN40, which was generated by passaging a field isolate in horses, displayed enhanced virulence in horses but caused no clinical symptoms in donkeys. Infection with DV117 induced acute EIA in nearly 100 % of donkeys. Genomic analysis of DV117 revealed a significantly higher frequency of A-to-G substitutions when compared to LN40. Furthermore, detailed analysis of dinucleotide editing showed that A-to-G mutations had a preference for 5'TpA and 5'ApA. These results strongly implicated the activity of the adenosine deaminase, ADAR1, in this type of mutation. Further investigation demonstrated that overexpression of donkey ADAR1 increased A-to-G mutations within the genome of EIAV. Together with our previous finding that multiple mutations in multiple genes are generated in DV117 during its adaptation from horses to donkeys, the present study suggests that ADAR1-induced A-to-G mutations occur during virus adaption to related new hosts contributing to the alteration of EIAV host tropism.",2016 Oct,Arch Virol. 2016 Oct;161(10):2667-72. doi: 10.1007/s00705-016-2951-3.

Both conditions presented with lentiginous phenotypes. The aim of this study was to arrive at definite diagnoses of three Chinese boys with clinically suspected lentigines-related syndromes. ADAR1, ABCB6, SASH1 and PTPN11 were candidate genes for mutational screening. Sanger sequencing was performed to identify the mutations, whereas bioinformatic analysis was used to predict the pathogenicity of novel missense mutations. Two novel mutations c.1537A>C (p.Ser513Arg) and 1527_1530dupAAGT (p.Leu511Lysfs*21) in SASH1 and a common p.Thr468Met mutation in PTPN11 were detected in three pediatric patients with lentiginous phenotypes, respectively.

27044320,The role of RNA editing by ADAR1 in prevention of innate immune sensing of self-RNA.,"The innate immune system is the first line of the cellular defence against invading pathogens. A critical component of this defence is the capacity to discriminate foreign RNA molecules, which are distinct from most cellular RNAs in structure and/or modifications. However, a series of rare autoimmune/autoinflammatory diseases in humans highlight the propensity for the innate immune sensing system to be activated by endogenous cellular double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs), underscoring the fine line between distinguishing self from non-self. The RNA editing enzyme ADAR1 has recently emerged as a key regulator that prevents innate immune pathway activation, principally the cytosolic dsRNA sensor MDA5, from inducing interferon in response to double-stranded RNA structures within endogenous RNAs. Adenosine-to-Inosine RNA editing by ADAR1 is proposed to destabilise duplexes formed from inverted repetitive elements within RNAs, which appear to prevent MDA5 from sensing these RNA as virus-like in the cytoplasm. Aberrant activation of these pathways has catastrophic effects at both a cellular and organismal level, contributing to one of the causes of the conditions collectively known as the type I interferonopathies.",2016 Oct,J Mol Med (Berl). 2016 Oct;94(10):1095-1102. doi: 10.1007/s00109-016-1416-1.

27185203,Identification and characterization of a constitutively expressed Ctenopharyngodon idella ADAR1 splicing isoform (CiADAR1a).,"As one member of ADAR family, ADAR1 (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1) can convert adenosine to inosine within dsRNA. There are many ADAR1 splicing isoforms in mammals, including an interferon (IFN) inducible ∼150 kD protein (ADAR1-p150) and a constitutively expressed ∼110 kD protein (ADAR1-p110). The structural diversity of ADAR1 splicing isoforms may reflect their multiple functions. ADAR1 splicing isoforms were also found in fish. In our previous study, we have cloned and identified two different grass carp ADAR1 splicing isoforms, i.e. CiADAR1 and CiADAR1-like, both of them are IFN-inducible proteins. In this paper, we identified a novel CiADAR1 splicing isoform gene (named CiADAR1a). CiADAR1a gene contains 15 exons and 14 introns. Its full-length cDNA is comprised of a 5' UTR (359 bp), a 3' UTR (229 bp) and a 2952 bp ORF encoding a polypeptide of 983 amino acids with one Z-DNA binding domain, three dsRNA binding motifs and a highly conserved hydrolytic deamination domain. CiADAR1a was constitutively expressed in Ctenopharyngodon idella kidney (CIK) cells regardless of Poly I:C stimulation by Western blot assay. In normal condition, CiADAR1a was found to be present mainly in the nucleus. After treatment with Poly I:C, it gradually shifted to cytoplasm. To further investigate the mechanism of transcriptional regulation of CiADAR1a, we cloned and identified its promoter sequence. The transcriptional start site of CiADAR1a is mapped within the truncated exon 2. CiADAR1a promoter is 1303 bp in length containing 4 IRF-Es. In the present study, we constructed pcDNA3.1 eukaryotic expression vectors with IRF1 and IRF3 and co-transfected them with pGL3-CiADAR1a promoter into CIK cells. The results showed that neither the over-expression of IRF1 or IRF3 nor Poly I:C stimulation significantly impacted CiADAR1a promoter activity in CIK cells. Together, according to the molecular and expression characteristics, subcellular localization and transcriptional regulatory mechanism, we deduced that CiADAR1a shared a high degree of homology with mammalian ADAR1-p110.",2016 Oct,Dev Comp Immunol. 2016 Oct;63:10-7. doi: 10.1016/j.dci.2016.05.008.

27373511,ADAR-Mediated RNA Editing Predicts Progression and Prognosis of Gastric Cancer.,"BACKGROUD & AIMS: Gastric cancer (GC) is the third leading cause of global cancer mortality. Adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing is a recently described novel epigenetic mechanism involving sequence alterations at the RNA but not DNA level, primarily mediated by ADAR (adenosine deaminase that act on RNA) enzymes. Emerging evidence suggests a role for RNA editing and ADARs in cancer, however, the relationship between RNA editing and GC development and progression remains unknown. METHODS: In this study, we leveraged on the next-generation sequencing transcriptomics to demarcate the GC RNA editing landscape and the role of ADARs in this deadly malignancy. RESULTS: Relative to normal gastric tissues, almost all GCs displayed a clear RNA misediting phenotype with ADAR1/2 dysregulation arising from the genomic gain and loss of the ADAR1 and ADAR2 gene in primary GCs, respectively. Clinically, patients with GCs exhibiting ADAR1/2 imbalance demonstrated extremely poor prognoses in multiple independent cohorts. Functionally, we demonstrate in vitro and in vivo that ADAR-mediated RNA misediting is closely associated with GC pathogenesis, with ADAR1 and ADAR2 playing reciprocal oncogenic and tumor suppressive roles through their catalytic deaminase domains, respectively. Using an exemplary target gene PODXL (podocalyxin-like), we demonstrate that the ADAR2-regulated recoding editing at codon 241 (His to Arg) confers a loss-of-function phenotype that neutralizes the tumorigenic ability of the unedited PODXL. CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights a major role for RNA editing in GC disease and progression, an observation potentially missed by previous next-generation sequencing analyses of GC focused on DNA alterations alone.

27595325,Adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing controls cathepsin S expression in atherosclerosis by enabling HuR-mediated post-transcriptional regulation.,"Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing, which is catalyzed by a family of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) enzymes, is important in the epitranscriptomic regulation of RNA metabolism. However, the role of A-to-I RNA editing in vascular disease is unknown. Here we show that cathepsin S mRNA (CTSS), which encodes a cysteine protease associated with angiogenesis and atherosclerosis, is highly edited in human endothelial cells. The 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) of the CTSS transcript contains two inverted repeats, the AluJo and AluSx(+) regions, which form a long stem-loop structure that is recognized by ADAR1 as a substrate for editing. RNA editing enables the recruitment of the stabilizing RNA-binding protein human antigen R (HuR; encoded by ELAVL1) to the 3' UTR of the CTSS transcript, thereby controlling CTSS mRNA stability and expression. In endothelial cells, ADAR1 overexpression or treatment of cells with hypoxia or with the inflammatory cytokines interferon-γ and tumor-necrosis-factor-α induces CTSS RNA editing and consequently increases cathepsin S expression. ADAR1 levels and the extent of CTSS RNA editing are associated with changes in cathepsin S levels in patients with atherosclerotic vascular diseases, including subclinical atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, aortic aneurysms and advanced carotid atherosclerotic disease.

27911851,Inherited variants affecting RNA editing may contribute to ovarian cancer susceptibility: results from a large-scale collaboration.,"RNA editing in mammals is a form of post-transcriptional modification in which adenosine is converted to inosine by the adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADAR) family of enzymes. Based on evidence of altered ADAR expression in epithelial ovarian cancers (EOC), we hypothesized that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ADAR genes modify EOC susceptibility, potentially by altering ovarian tissue gene expression. Using directly genotyped and imputed data from 10,891 invasive EOC cases and 21,693 controls, we evaluated the associations of 5,303 SNPs in ADAD1, ADAR, ADAR2, ADAR3, and SND1. Unconditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), with adjustment for European ancestry. We conducted gene-level analyses using the Admixture Maximum Likelihood (AML) test and the Sequence-Kernel Association test for common and rare variants (SKAT-CR). Association analysis revealed top risk-associated SNP rs77027562 (OR (95% CI)= 1.39 (1.17-1.64), P=1.0x10-4) in ADAR3 and rs185455523 in SND1 (OR (95% CI)= 0.68 (0.56-0.83), P=2.0x10-4). When restricting to serous histology (n=6,500), the magnitude of association strengthened for rs185455523 (OR=0.60, P=1.0x10-4). Gene-level analyses revealed that variation in ADAR was associated (P<0.05) with EOC susceptibility, with PAML=0.022 and PSKAT-CR=0.020. Expression quantitative trait locus analysis in EOC tissue revealed significant associations (P<0.05) with ADAR expression for several SNPs in ADAR, including rs1127313 (G/A), a SNP in the 3' untranslated region.

27729454,Ubiquitin-dependent Turnover of Adenosine Deaminase Acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) Is Required for Efficient Antiviral Activity of Type I Interferon.,"Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) catalyzes RNA editing of cellular and viral RNAs. Besides RNA editing, ADAR1 has recently been shown to play important roles in maintaining the body balance, including tissue homoeostasis, organ development, and autoimmune regulations, by inhibiting both IFN production and subsequent IFN-activated pathways. Accordingly, the question was raised how IFN signaling induced by viral infections overcomes the inhibitory effect of constitutively expressed ADAR1 (ADAR1-P110) to execute efficient antiviral activity. Here we unexpectedly found that IFN signaling promoted Lys(48)-linked ubiquitination and degradation of ADAR1-P110. Furthermore, we identified the E3 ligase β transducin repeat-containing protein responsible for IFN-mediated ADAR1-P110 down-regulation. IFN signaling promoted the interaction between β transducin repeat-containing protein and ADAR1-P110 as well as protein turnover of ADAR1-P110. Moreover, we found that both lysine 574 and 576 are essential for ADAR1-P110 ubiquitination. Critically, we demonstrated that down-regulation of ADAR1-P110 is required for IFN signaling to execute efficient antiviral activity during viral infections.

Recently our laboratory reported crystal structures of the human ADAR2 deaminase domain bound to duplex RNA revealing a protein loop that binds the RNA on the 5' side of the modification site. This 5' binding loop appears to be one contributor to substrate specificity differences between ADAR family members. In this study, we endeavored to reveal detailed structure-activity relationships in this loop to advance our understanding of RNA recognition by ADAR2. To achieve this goal, we established a high-throughput mutagenesis approach which allows rapid screening of ADAR variants in single yeast cells and provides quantitative evaluation for enzymatic activity. Using this approach, we determined the importance of specific amino acids at 19 different positions in the ADAR2 5' binding loop and revealed six residues that provide essential structural elements supporting the fold of the loop and key RNA-binding functional groups.

27584568,Janus effects of ADAR1 on CVB3-induced viral myocarditis at different infection stages.,"BACKGROUND: Coxsackievirus (CVB3) infection is the most common cause of viral myocarditis (VMC) characterized by viral infection and myocardial inflammation. ADAR1, the interferon (IFN)-inducible adenosine deaminase acting on RNA, has been reported to be functional in various viruses. Recent studies have demonstrated that ADAR1 holds an antiviral role or promotes viral replication depending on virus type. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to investigate whether or not ADAR1 affects CVB3-induced VMC. METHODS: We generated an acute VMC mouse model by CVB3 infection. ADAR1 expression was manipulated by in vivo polyethyleneimine-mediated ADAR1 up/down-regulation plasmid delivery. RESULTS: Our study indicated that ADAR1 was up-regulated after CVB3 infection. ADAR1 down-regulation in the early stage of viral infection ameliorated CVB3-induced VMC. In this stage, viral replication was a key point to initiate inflammatory response. ADAR1 may affect inflammation mainly through viral replication as shown by the elevated IFN-β and decreased viral load with ADAR1 down-regulation. However, when the inflammatory response was established in the middle-late stage of viral infection, ADAR1 down-regulation aggravated disease progression. In this stage, Western blot analysis indicated that ADAR1 may directly influence inflammatory response through PKR and NF-κB signaling. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that ADAR1 exhibited double-edged effects during the early or middle-late stage of CVB3-induced VMC. Our findings may provide new insights into the therapeutic treatments of VMC.",2016 Nov 15,Int J Cardiol. 2016 Nov 15;223:898-905. doi: 10.1016/j.ijcard.2016.08.315.

CAPS1 pre-mRNA is known to undergo adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing in its coding region, which results in a glutamate-to-glycine conversion at a site in its C-terminal region. However, the physiological significance of CAPS1 RNA editing remains elusive. Here, we created mutant mice in which edited CAPS1 was solely expressed. These mice were lean due to increased energy expenditure caused by physical hyperactivity. Electrophysiological and biochemical analyses demonstrated that the exocytosis of DCVs was upregulated in the chromaffin cells and neurons of these mice. Furthermore, we showed that edited CAPS1 bound preferentially to the activated form of syntaxin-1A, a component of the exocytotic fusion complex.

During transcriptomic studies of the RL region of the genome, we characterized the 7.5 kbp gene of the ERL lncRNA (edited repeat-long, long non-coding RNA), which may act as a natural antisense transcript (NAT) of the major GaHV-2 oncogene meq and of two of the three miRNA clusters. During infections in vivo and in vitro, we detected hyperediting of the ERL lncRNA that appeared to be directly correlated with ADAR1 expression levels. The ERL lncRNA was expressed equally during the lytic and latent phases of infection and during viral reactivation, but its hyperediting increased only during the lytic infection of chicken embryo fibroblasts. We also showed that chicken ADAR1 expression was controlled by the JAK/STAT IFN-response pathway, through an inducible promoter containing IFN-stimulated response elements that were functional during stimulation with IFN-α or poly(I:C).

27696924,The RNA-editing deaminase ADAR is involved in stress resistance of Artemia diapause embryos.,"The most widespread type of RNA editing, conversion of adenosine to inosine (A→I), is catalyzed by two members of the adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) family, ADAR1 and ADAR2. These enzymes edit transcripts for neurotransmitter receptors and ion channels during adaption to changes in the physical environment. In the primitive crustacean Artemia, when maternal adults are exposed to unfavorable conditions, they release diapause embryos to withstand harsh environments. The aim of the current study was therefore to elucidate the role of ADAR of Artemia diapause embryos in resistance to stress. Here, we identified Artemia ADAR (Ar-ADAR), which harbors a putative nuclear localization sequence (NLS) and two double-stranded RNA-binding motifs (dsRBMs) in the amino-terminal region and an adenosine deaminase (AD) domain in the carboxyl-terminal region. Western blot and immunofluorescence analysis revealed that Ar-ADAR is expressed abundantly in post-diapause embryos. Artemia (n = 200, three replicates) were tested under basal and stress conditions. We found that Ar-ADAR was significantly induced in response to the stresses of salinity and heat-shock. Furthermore, in vivo knockdown of Ar-ADAR (n = 100, three replicates) by RNA interference induced formation of pseudo-diapause embryos, which lack resistance to the stresses and exhibit high levels of apoptosis. These results indicate that Ar-ADAR contributes to resistance to stress in Artemia diapause embryos.",2016 Nov,Stress. 2016 Nov;19(6):609-620. doi: 10.1080/10253890.2016.1244523.

MDSCs are divided into granulocytic (G‑MDSCs) and monocytic subsets. In the present study, the microRNA profiles of the G‑MDSCs were determined and the differential expression of microRNAs between G‑MDSCs from tumor‑bearing mice and tumor‑free mice was examined. The number of G‑MDSCs in spleens of Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC)‑bearing mice was ~6‑fold higher than in spleens of normal mice (13.54±1.74% vs. 2.14±1.44%; P<0.01) and G‑MDSCs account for about 72.9% of all MDSCs. The microRNA (miRNA) profiles of the G‑MDSCs from spleen of LLC‑bearing mice were obtained using a microRNA microarray and compared with their counterparts from spleens of tumor‑free mice. A total of 43 miRNAs with >1.3‑fold increased or decreased change were differentially expressed between the experimental and control group mice. The levels of nine of these differentially expressed miRNAs, miRNA‑468 (miR‑486), miR‑192, miR‑128, miR‑125a, miR‑149, miR‑27a, miR‑125b, miR‑350 and miR‑328, were also analyzed by RT‑qPCR to validate the microarray data. The concordance rate between the results tested by the two methods was 88.9%. Bioinformatics analyses revealed that these miRNAs may act on various target genes, including Adar, Pik3r1, Rybp and Rabgap1, to regulate the survival, differentiation and the function of tumor‑induced granulocytic MDSCs. The results revealed microRNAs and potential targets that may be vital for regulating survival, differentiation and function of G‑MDSCs induced by LLC.

However, adenosines are not edited at equal levels nor do these editing levels correlate well with ADAR expression levels. Therefore, additional mechanisms are utilized by the cell to dictate the editing efficiency at a given adenosine. To examine cis-and trans-acting factors that regulate A-to-I editing levels specifically in neural cells, we utilized the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans We demonstrate that a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) binding protein, ADR-1, inhibits editing in neurons, which is largely masked when examining editing levels from whole animals. Furthermore, expression of ADR-1 and mRNA expression of the editing target can act synergistically to regulate editing efficiency. In addition, we identify a dsRNA region within the Y75B8A.83' UTR that acts as acis-regulatory element by enhancing ADR-2 editing efficiency. Together, this work identifies mechanisms that regulate editing efficiency of noncoding A-to-I editing sites, which comprise the largest class of ADAR targets.",2016 May,RNA. 2016 May;22(5):722-8. doi: 10.1261/rna.055079.115.

Understanding of the ADAR reaction mechanism, the origin of editing-site selectivity, and the effect of mutations is limited by the lack of high-resolution structural data for complexes of ADARs bound to substrate RNAs. Here we describe four crystal structures of the human ADAR2 deaminase domain bound to RNA duplexes bearing a mimic of the deamination reaction intermediate. These structures, together with structure-guided mutagenesis and RNA-modification experiments, explain the basis of the ADAR deaminase domain's dsRNA specificity, its base-flipping mechanism, and its nearest-neighbor preferences. In addition, we identified an ADAR2-specific RNA-binding loop near the enzyme active site, thus rationalizing differences in selectivity observed between different ADARs.

26692549,"ADAR1, inosine and the immune sensing system: distinguishing self from non-self.","The conversion of genomically encoded adenosine to inosine in dsRNA is termed as A-to-I RNA editing. This process is catalyzed by two of the three mammalian ADAR proteins (ADAR1 and ADAR2) both of which have essential functions for normal organismal homeostasis. The phenotype of ADAR2 deficiency can be primarily ascribed to a lack of site-selective editing of a single transcript in the brain. In contrast, the biology and substrates responsible for the Adar1(-/-) phenotype have remained more elusive. Several recent studies have identified that a feature of absence or reductions of ADAR1 activity, conserved across human and mouse models, is a profound activation of interferon-stimulated gene signatures and innate immune responses. Further analysis of this observation has lead to the conclusion that editing by ADAR1 is required to prevent activation of the cytosolic innate immune system, primarily focused on the dsRNA sensor MDA5 and leading to downstream signaling via MAVS. The delineation of this mechanism places ADAR1 at the interface between the cells ability to differentiate self- from non-self dsRNA. Based on MDA5 dsRNA recognition requisites, the mechanism indicates that the type of dsRNA must fulfil a particular structural characteristic, rather than a sequence-specific requirement. While additional studies are required to molecularly verify the genetic model, the observations to date collectively identify A-to-I editing by ADAR1 as a key modifier of the cellular response to endogenous dsRNA.",2016 Mar-Apr,Wiley Interdiscip Rev RNA. 2016 Mar-Apr;7(2):157-72. doi: 10.1002/wrna.1322.

26817845,Editing of Cellular Self-RNAs by Adenosine Deaminase ADAR1 Suppresses Innate Immune Stress Responses.,"Adenosine deaminases acting on double-stranded RNA (ADARs) catalyze the deamination of adenosine (A) to produce inosine (I) in double-stranded (ds) RNA structures, a process known as A-to-I RNA editing. dsRNA is an important trigger of innate immune responses, including interferon (IFN) production and action. We examined the role of A-to-I RNA editing by two ADARs, ADAR1 and ADAR2, in the sensing of self-RNA in the absence of pathogen infection, leading to activation of IFN-induced, RNA-mediated responses in mouse embryo fibroblasts. IFN treatment of Adar1(-/-) cells lacking both the p110 constitutive and p150 IFN-inducible ADAR1 proteins induced formation of stress granules, whereas neither wild-type (WT) nor Adar2(-/-) cells displayed a comparable stress granule response following IFN treatment. Phosphorylation of protein synthesis initiation factor eIF2α at serine 51 was increased in IFN-treated Adar1(-/-) cells but not in either WT or Adar2(-/-) cells following IFN treatment. Analysis by deep sequencing of mouse exonic loci containing A-to-I-editing sites revealed that the majority of editing in mouse embryo fibroblasts was carried out by ADAR1. IFN treatment increased editing in both WT and Adar2(-/-) cells but not in either Adar1(-/-) or Adar1(-/-) (p150) cells or Stat1(-/-) or Stat2(-/-) cells. Hyper-edited sites found in predicted duplex structures showed strand bias of editing for some RNAs.

RNA editing has the potential to impact a variety of cellular processes and is implicated in diseases such as cancer. Yet, the precise mechanisms by which RNA editing controls cellular processes are poorly understood. Here, we characterize sequences altered by RNA editing in patient samples from lymphoma, neuroblastoma and head and neck cancers. We show that A-to-I RNA editing sites are highly conserved across samples of the same tissue type and that most editing sites identified in tumors are also detectable in normal tissues. Next, we identify the significant changes in editing levels of known sites between tumor and paired ""normal"" tissues across 14 cancer types (627 pairs) from The Cancer Genome Atlas project and show that the complexity of RNA editing regulation cannot be captured by the activity of ADAR family genes alone. Our pan-cancer analysis confirms previous results on individual tumor types and suggests that changes of RNA editing levels in coding and 3'UTR regions could be a general mechanism to promote tumor growth. We also propose a model explaining how altered RNA editing levels affect microRNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulation of oncogenes and tumor-suppressors.",2016 Mar 16,Sci Rep. 2016 Mar 16;6:23226. doi: 10.1038/srep23226.,"['Zhang L', 'Yang CS', 'Varelas X', 'Monti S']",True

Indeed, targets for editing include key mediators of synaptic transmission with an overall significant effect on neuronal signaling. In addition, editing influences splice-site choice and miRNA targeting capacity, and thereby regulates neuronal gene expression. Editing efficiency at most of these sites increases during neuronal differentiation and brain maturation in a spatiotemporal manner.

AR2 mice, in which an RNA editing enzyme adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 2 (ADAR2) is conditionally knocked out in the motor neurons, exhibit a progressive ALS phenotype with TDP-43 pathology in the motor neurons through a Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptor-mediated mechanism. Therefore, amelioration of the increased Ca(2+) influx by AMPA receptor antagonists may be a potential ALS therapy. Here, we showed that orally administered perampanel, a selective, non-competitive AMPA receptor antagonist significantly prevented the progression of the ALS phenotype and normalized the TDP-43 pathology-associated death of motor neurons in the AR2 mice.

ADAR1 is ubiquitously expressed in eukaryotes and participate in various cellular processes such as differentiation, proliferation and immune responses. We report here a new proteomics study of HEK293T cells with and without ADAR1 overexpression. The up- and down-regulated proteins by ADAR1 overexpression are identified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) followed by label-free protein quantification. Totally 1,495 proteins (FDR < 0.01) are identified, among which 211 are up- and 159 are down-regulated for at least 1.5-fold (n = 3, p < 0.05). Gene ontology analysis reveals that these ADAR1-regulated proteins are involved in protein translation and cell cycle regulation. Bioinformatics analysis identifies a closely related network consistent for the protein translation machinery and a tightly connected network through proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-interactions. Up-regulation of the proteins in the PCNA-mediated cell proliferation network is confirmed by Western blotting. In addition, ADAR1 overexpression is confirmed to increase cell proliferation in HEK293T cells and A549 cells.

27290639,New perspective in diagnostics of mitochondrial disorders: two years' experience with whole-exome sequencing at a national paediatric centre.,"BACKGROUND: Whole-exome sequencing (WES) has led to an exponential increase in identification of causative variants in mitochondrial disorders (MD). METHODS: We performed WES in 113 MD suspected patients from Polish paediatric reference centre, in whom routine testing failed to identify a molecular defect. WES was performed using TruSeqExome enrichment, followed by variant prioritization, validation by Sanger sequencing, and segregation with the disease phenotype in the family. RESULTS: Likely causative mutations were identified in 67 (59.3 %) patients; these included variants in mtDNA (6 patients) and nDNA: X-linked (9 patients), autosomal dominant (5 patients), and autosomal recessive (47 patients, 11 homozygotes). Novel variants accounted for 50.5 % (50/99) of all detected changes. In 47 patients, changes in 31 MD-related genes (ACAD9, ADCK3, AIFM1, CLPB, COX10, DLD, EARS2, FBXL4, MTATP6, MTFMT, MTND1, MTND3, MTND5, NAXE, NDUFS6, NDUFS7, NDUFV1, OPA1, PARS2, PC, PDHA1, POLG, RARS2, RRM2B, SCO2, SERAC1, SLC19A3, SLC25A12, TAZ, TMEM126B, VARS2) were identified. The ACAD9, CLPB, FBXL4, PDHA1 genes recurred more than twice suggesting higher general/ethnic prevalence. In 19 cases, variants in 18 non-MD related genes (ADAR, CACNA1A, CDKL5, CLN3, CPS1, DMD, DYSF, GBE1, GFAP, HSD17B4, MECP2, MYBPC3, PEX5, PGAP2, PIGN, PRF1, SBDS, SCN2A) were found. The percentage of positive WES results rose gradually with increasing probability of MD according to the Mitochondrial Disease Criteria (MDC) scale (from 36 to 90 % for low and high probability, respectively). The percentage of detected MD-related genes compared with non MD-related genes also grew with the increasing MD likelihood (from 20 to 97 %). Molecular diagnosis was established in 30/47 (63.8 %) neonates and in 17/28 (60.7 %) patients with basal ganglia involvement. Mutations in CLPB, SERAC1, TAZ genes were identified in neonates with 3-methylglutaconic aciduria (3-MGA) as a discriminative feature. New MD-related candidate gene (NDUFB8) is under verification. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest WES rather than targeted NGS as the method of choice in diagnostics of MD in children, including neonates with 3-MGA aciduria, who died without determination of disease cause and with limited availability of laboratory data. There is a strong correlation between the degree of MD diagnosis by WES and MD likelihood expressed by the MDC scale.",2016 Jun 12,J Transl Med. 2016 Jun 12;14(1):174. doi: 10.1186/s12967-016-0930-9.,"['Pronicka E', 'Piekutowska-Abramczuk D', 'Ciara E', 'Trubicka J', 'Rokicki D', 'Karkucińska-Więckowska A', 'Pajdowska M', 'Jurkiewicz E', 'Halat P', 'Kosińska J', 'Pollak A', 'Rydzanicz M', 'Stawinski P', 'Pronicki M', 'Krajewska-Walasek M', 'Płoski R']",False

TDP-43 in the pathological brains and spinal cords of ALS/FTLD patients is abnormally fragmented and phosphorylated. It is believed that the generation of aggregation-prone TDP-43 fragments initiates TDP-43 pathology, and we previously reported that calpain has an important role in the generation of such aggregation-prone TDP-43 fragments. However, the role of phosphorylation in TDP-43 pathology has not been largely elucidated, despite previous observations that several kinases and their kinases are involved in TDP-43 phosphorylation. Here, we investigated the role of TDP-43 phosphorylation in the calpain-dependent cleavage of TDP-43 and found that phosphorylated, full-length TDP-43 and calpain-dependent TDP-43 fragments were more resistant to cleavage by calpain than endogenous full-length TDP-43 was. These results suggest that both phosphorylated and calpain-cleaved TDP-43 fragments persist intracellularly for a length of time that is sufficient for self-aggregation, thereby serving as seeds for inclusions.",2016 Jun,Neurosci Res. 2016 Jun;107:63-9. doi: 10.1016/j.neures.2015.12.006.

Data of the analysis are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD002188. Among 504 candidate nucleolar proteins, the overrepresented gene ontology terms included such cellular compartmentcategories as ""nucleolus"", ""ribosome"" and ""chromatin"". Consistent with such classification, the most overrepresented functional gene ontology terms were related to RNA metabolism/ribosomal biogenesis, translation, and chromatin organization. Sixteen putative nucleolar proteins were associated with neurodevelopmental phenotypes in humans. Microcephaly and/or cognitive impairment were the most common phenotypic manifestations. Although several such proteins have links to ribosomal biogenesis and/or genomic stability/chromatin structure (e.g. EMG1, RPL10, DKC1, EIF4A3, FLNA, SMC1, ATRX, MCM4, NSD1, LMNA, or CUL4B), others including ADAR, LARP7, GTF2I, or TCF4 have no such connections known.

Hyperediting by adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADAR) enzymes was quantified over time using RNA-seq data from activated mouse macrophages to identify 342 Editing Enriched Regions (EERs), indicative of highly structured dsRNA. Analysis of publicly available data sets for samples of human peripheral blood monocytes resulted in discovery of 3438 EERs in the human transcriptome. Human EERs had predicted secondary structures that were significantly more stable than those of mouse EERs and were located primarily in introns, whereas nearly all mouse EERs were in 3' UTRs. Seventy-four mouse EER-associated genes contained an EER in the orthologous human gene, although nucleotide sequence and position were only rarely conserved. Among these conserved EER-associated genes were several TNF alpha-signaling genes, including Sppl2a and Tnfrsf1b, important for processing and recognition of TNF alpha, respectively. Using publicly available data and experimental validation, we found that a significant proportion of EERs accumulated in the nucleus, a strategy that may prevent aberrant activation of proinflammatory cascades in the cytoplasm.

Moreover, splicing rates affect nuclear retention and will therefore also influence the exposure of pre-mRNAs to the editing-competent nuclear environment. Here, we systematically test the influence of splice rates on RNA-editing using reporter genes but also endogenous substrates. We demonstrate for the first time that the extent of editing is controlled by splicing kinetics when editing is guided by intronic elements. In contrast, editing sites that are exclusively defined by exonic structures are almost unaffected by the splicing efficiency of nearby introns. In addition, we show that editing levels in pre- and mature mRNAs do not match.

27199464,"ADAR1-Mediated RNA Editing, A Novel Mechanism Controlling Phenotypic Modulation of Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells.","RATIONALE: Vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) phenotypic modulation is characterized by the downregulation of SMC contractile genes. Platelet-derived growth factor-BB, a well-known stimulator of SMC phenotypic modulation, downregulates SMC genes via posttranscriptional regulation. The underlying mechanisms, however, remain largely unknown. OBJECTIVE: To establish RNA editing as a novel mechanism controlling SMC phenotypic modulation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Precursor mRNAs (pre-mRNA) of SMC myosin heavy chain and smooth muscle α-actin were accumulated while their mature mRNAs were downregulated during SMC phenotypic modulation, suggesting an abnormal splicing of the pre-mRNAs. The abnormal splicing resulted from SMC marker pre-mRNA editing that was facilitated by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1), an enzyme converting adenosines to inosines (A→I editing) in RNA sequences. ADAR1 expression inversely correlated with SMC myosin heavy chain and smooth muscle α-actin levels; knockdown of ADAR1 restored SMC myosin heavy chain and smooth muscle α-actin expression in phenotypically modulated SMC, and editase domain mutation diminished the ADAR1-mediated abnormal splicing of SMC marker pre-mRNAs. Moreover, the abnormal splicing/editing of SMC myosin heavy chain and smooth muscle α-actin pre-mRNAs occurred during injury-induced vascular remodeling. Importantly, heterozygous knockout of ADAR1 dramatically inhibited injury-induced neointima formation and restored SMC marker expression, demonstrating a critical role of ADAR1 in SMC phenotypic modulation and vascular remodeling in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Our results unraveled a novel molecular mechanism, that is, pre-mRNA editing, governing SMC phenotypic modulation.",2016 Jul 22,Circ Res. 2016 Jul 22;119(3):463-9. doi: 10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.309003.

27439697,Playing the role of weak clique property in link prediction: A friend recommendation model.,"An important fact in studying link prediction is that the structural properties of networks have significant impacts on the performance of algorithms. Therefore, how to improve the performance of link prediction with the aid of structural properties of networks is an essential problem. By analyzing many real networks, we find a typical structural property: nodes are preferentially linked to the nodes with the weak clique structure (abbreviated as PWCS to simplify descriptions). Based on this PWCS phenomenon, we propose a local friend recommendation (FR) index to facilitate link prediction. Our experiments show that the performance of FR index is better than some famous local similarity indices, such as Common Neighbor (CN) index, Adamic-Adar (AA) index and Resource Allocation (RA) index. We then explain why PWCS can give rise to the better performance of FR index in link prediction. Finally, a mixed friend recommendation index (labelled MFR) is proposed by utilizing the PWCS phenomenon, which further improves the accuracy of link prediction.",2016 Jul 21,Sci Rep. 2016 Jul 21;6:30098. doi: 10.1038/srep30098.,"['Ma C', 'Zhou T', 'Zhang HF']",False
27094861,Human norovirus hyper-mutation revealed by ultra-deep sequencing.,"Human noroviruses (NoVs) are a major cause of gastroenteritis worldwide. It is thought that, similar to other RNA viruses, high mutation rates allow NoVs to evolve fast and to undergo rapid immune escape at the population level. However, the rate and spectrum of spontaneous mutations of human NoVs have not been quantified previously. Here, we analyzed the intra-patient diversity of the NoV capsid by carrying out RT-PCR and ultra-deep sequencing with 100,000-fold coverage of 16 stool samples from symptomatic patients. This revealed the presence of low-frequency sequences carrying large numbers of U-to-C or A-to-G base transitions, suggesting a role for hyper-mutation in NoV diversity. To more directly test for hyper-mutation, we performed transfection assays in which the production of mutations was restricted to a single cell infection cycle. This confirmed the presence of sequences with multiple U-to-C/A-to-G transitions, and suggested that hyper-mutation contributed a large fraction of the total NoV spontaneous mutation rate. The type of changes produced and their sequence context are compatible with ADAR-mediated editing of the viral RNA.",2016 Jul,Infect Genet Evol. 2016 Jul;41:233-239. doi: 10.1016/j.meegid.2016.04.017.

27797325,[ADAR-mediated messenger RNA editing: analysis at the proteome level].,"Post-transcriptional RNA editing by RNA specific adenosine deaminases (ADAR) was discovered more than two decades ago. It provides additional regulation of animal and human transcriptome. In most cases, it occurs in nervous tissue, where, as a result of the reaction, adenosine is converted to inosine in particular sites of RNA. In case of messenger RNA, during translation, inosine is recognized as guanine leading to amino acid substitutions. Those substitutions are shown to affect substantially the function of proteins, e.g. subunits of the glutamate receptor. Nevertheless, most of the works on RNA editing use analysis of nucleic acids, even those which deal with a coding RNA. In this review, we propose the use of shotgun proteomics based on high resolution liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry for investigation of the effects of RNA editing at the protein level. Recently developed methods of big data processing allow combining the results of various omics techniques, being referred to as proteogenomics. The proposed proteogenomic approach for the analysis of RNA editing at the protein level will directly conduct a qualitative and quantitative analysis of protein edited sequences in the scale of whole proteome.",2016 Jul,Biomed Khim. 2016 Jul;62(5):510-519. doi: 10.18097/PBMC20166205510.,"['Kliuchnikova AA', 'Kuznetsova KG', 'Moshkovskii SA']",True
26612708,To edit or not to edit: regulation of ADAR editing specificity and efficiency.,"Hundreds to millions of adenosine (A)-to-inosine (I) modifications are present in eukaryotic transcriptomes and play an essential role in the creation of proteomic and phenotypic diversity. As adenosine and inosine have different base-pairing properties, the functional consequences of these modifications or 'edits' include altering coding potential, splicing, and miRNA-mediated gene silencing of transcripts. However, rather than serving as a static control of gene expression, A-to-I editing provides a means to dynamically rewire the genetic code during development and in a cell-type specific manner. Interestingly, during normal development, in specific cells, and in both neuropathological diseases and cancers, the extent of RNA editing does not directly correlate with levels of the substrate mRNA or the adenosine deaminase that act on RNA (ADAR) editing enzymes, implying that cellular factors are required for spatiotemporal regulation of A-to-I editing. The factors that affect the specificity and extent of ADAR activity have been thoroughly dissected in vitro. Yet, we still lack a complete understanding of how specific ADAR family members can selectively deaminate certain adenosines while others cannot. Additionally, in the cellular environment, ADAR specificity and editing efficiency is likely to be influenced by cellular factors, which is currently an area of intense investigation. Data from many groups have suggested two main mechanisms for controlling A-to-I editing in the cell: (1) regulating ADAR accessibility to target RNAs and (2) protein-protein interactions that directly alter ADAR enzymatic activity. Recent studies suggest cis- and trans-acting RNA elements, heterodimerization and RNA-binding proteins play important roles in regulating RNA editing levels in vivo.

26601943,RNA Editing Modulates Human Hepatic Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Expression by Creating MicroRNA Recognition Sequence.,"Adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing is the most frequent type of post-transcriptional nucleotide conversion in humans, and it is catalyzed by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) enzymes. In this study we investigated the effect of RNA editing on human aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) expression because the AhR transcript potentially forms double-stranded structures, which are targets of ADAR enzymes. In human hepatocellular carcinoma-derived Huh-7 cells, the ADAR1 knockdown reduced the RNA editing levels in the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of the AhR transcript and increased the AhR protein levels. The ADAR1 knockdown enhanced the ligand-mediated induction of CYP1A1, a gene downstream of AhR. We investigated the possibility that A-to-I RNA editing creates miRNA targeting sites in the AhR mRNA and found that the miR-378-dependent down-regulation of AhR was abolished by ADAR1 knockdown. These results indicated that the ADAR1-mediated down-regulation of AhR could be attributed to the creation of a miR-378 recognition site in the AhR 3'-UTR. The interindividual differences in the RNA editing levels within the AhR 3'-UTR in a panel of 32 human liver samples were relatively small, whereas the differences in ADAR1 expression were large (220-fold). In the human liver samples a significant inverse association was observed between the miR-378 and AhR protein levels, suggesting that the RNA-editing-dependent down-regulation of AhR by miR-378 contributes to the variability in the constitutive hepatic expression of AhR. In conclusion, this study uncovered for the first time that A-to-I RNA editing modulates the potency of xenobiotic metabolism in the human liver.",2016 Jan 8,J Biol Chem. 2016 Jan 8;291(2):894-903. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M115.699363.

Dyschromatosis universalis hereditaria (DUH) and dyschromatosis symmetrica hereditaria are two major types. While clinical and histological presentations are similar in these two diseases, genetic diagnosis is critical in the differential diagnosis of these entities. METHODS: Three patients initially diagnosed with DUH were included. The gene test was carried out by targeted gene sequencing. All mutations detected on ADAR1 and ABCB6 genes were analyzed according to the frequency in control database, the mutation types, and the published evidence to determine the pathogenicity. RESULTS: Family pedigree and clinical presentations were reported in 3 patients from two Chinese families. All patients have prominent cutaneous dyschromatoses involving the whole body without systemic complications. Different pathogenic genes in these patients with similar phenotype were identified: One novel mutation on ADAR1 (c. 1325C>G) and one recurrent mutation in ABCB6 (c. 1270T>C), which successfully distinguished two diseases with the similar phenotype.

26813350,ADAR-mediated RNA editing suppresses sleep by acting as a brake on glutamatergic synaptic plasticity.,"It has been postulated that synaptic potentiation during waking is offset by a homoeostatic reduction in net synaptic strength during sleep. However, molecular mechanisms to support such a process are lacking. Here we demonstrate that deficiencies in the RNA-editing gene Adar increase sleep due to synaptic dysfunction in glutamatergic neurons in Drosophila. Specifically, the vesicular glutamate transporter is upregulated, leading to over-activation of NMDA receptors, and the reserve pool of glutamatergic synaptic vesicles is selectively expanded in Adar mutants. Collectively these changes lead to sustained neurotransmitter release under conditions that would otherwise result in synaptic depression. We propose that a shift in the balance from synaptic depression towards synaptic potentiation in sleep-promoting neurons underlies the increased sleep pressure of Adar-deficient animals. Our findings provide a plausible molecular mechanism linking sleep and synaptic plasticity.",2016 Jan 27,Nat Commun. 2016 Jan 27;7:10512. doi: 10.1038/ncomms10512.,"['Robinson JE', 'Paluch J', 'Dickman DK', 'Joiner WJ']",False

Dysfunction of A-to-I RNA editing can have catastrophic effects, particularly in the central nervous system. Thus, understanding how the process of RNA-editing is regulated has important implications for human health. However, at present, very little is known about the regulation of editing across tissues, and individuals. RESULTS: Here we present an analysis of RNA-editing patterns from 9 different tissues harvested from a single mouse. For comparison, we also analyzed data for 5 of these tissues harvested from 15 additional animals. We find that tissue specificity of editing largely reflects differential expression of substrate transcripts across tissues. We identified a surprising enrichment of editing in intronic regions of brain transcripts, that could account for previously reported higher levels of editing in brain. There exists a small but remarkable amount of editing which is tissue-specific, despite comparable expression levels of the edit site across multiple tissues. Expression levels of editing enzymes and their isoforms can explain some, but not all of this variation.

26817607,RDDpred: a condition-specific RNA-editing prediction model from RNA-seq data.,"BACKGROUND: RNA-editing is an important post-transcriptional RNA sequence modification performed by two catalytic enzymes, ""ADAR""(A-to-I) and ""APOBEC""(C-to-U). By utilizing high-throughput sequencing technologies, the biological function of RNA-editing has been actively investigated. Currently, RNA-editing is considered to be a key regulator that controls various cellular functions, such as protein activity, alternative splicing pattern of mRNA, and substitution of miRNA targeting site. DARNED, a public RDD database, reported that there are more than 300-thousands RNA-editing sites detected in human genome(hg19). Moreover, multiple studies suggested that RNA-editing events occur in highly specific conditions. According to DARNED, 97.62 % of registered editing sites were detected in a single tissue or in a specific condition, which also supports that the RNA-editing events occur condition-specifically. Since RNA-seq can capture the whole landscape of transcriptome, RNA-seq is widely used for RDD prediction. However, significant amounts of false positives or artefacts can be generated when detecting RNA-editing from RNA-seq. Since it is difficult to perform experimental validation at the whole-transcriptome scale, there should be a powerful computational tool to distinguish true RNA-editing events from artefacts. RESULT: We developed RDDpred, a Random Forest RDD classifier. RDDpred reports potentially true RNA-editing events from RNA-seq data. RDDpred was tested with two publicly available RNA-editing datasets and successfully reproduced RDDs reported in the two studies (90 %, 95 %) while rejecting false-discoveries (NPV: 75 %, 84 %). CONCLUSION: RDDpred automatically compiles condition-specific training examples without experimental validations and then construct a RDD classifier. As far as we know, RDDpred is the very first machine-learning based automated pipeline for RDD prediction. We believe that RDDpred will be very useful and can contribute significantly to the study of condition-specific RNA-editing.

NF90 is a member of the dsRNA binding domain (dsRBD) family of proteins. RNA binding partners identified so far include elements in 3' untranslated regions of specific mRNAs and several non-coding RNAs. In NF90, a tandem pair of dsRBDs separated by a natively unstructured segment confers dsRNA binding activity. We determined a crystal structure of the tandem dsRBDs of NF90 in complex with a synthetic dsRNA. This complex shows surprising similarity to the tandem dsRBDs from an adenosine-to-inosine editing enzyme, ADAR2 in complex with a substrate RNA. Residues involved in unusual base-specific recognition in the minor groove of dsRNA are conserved between NF90 and ADAR2.

Vitamin D related and interferon stimulated genes are good candidates as they are recently crosstalk altering interferon response. Thus single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within some of these genes and multiple stepwise regression analysis including other independent predictors (IL28B(rs12979860), serum 25OH-vitamin D, serum alfa-fetoprotein (AFP)) were performed on a cohort of 200 Egyptian CHC patients treated with Pegylated interferon-alpha (Peg-IFN) plus ribavirin. METHODS: SNPs in cytochrome P-450 (CYP2R1)(rs10741657AG), vitamin D receptor (VDR)(rs2228570AG, rs1544410CT), oligoadenylate synthetases-like (OASL)(rs1169279CT) and adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADAR)(rs1127309TC) genes were analyzed by real-time PCR. RESULTS: The carrier state of A allele in VDR rs2228570 and CYP2R1 rs10741657 genes were independently associated with SVR [OR 6.453 & 3.536, p < 0.01 respectively]. Combining carriers of A allele in CYP2R1 and VDR genes with IL28B C/C genotype increased the probability of SVR from 80 % to reach 87.8 %, 93 % and 100 %. No relation was found between VDR rs1544410CT, ADAR rs1127309TC, OASL rs1169279CT polymorphisms and treatment outcome.

26832817,ADAR1 Suppresses the Activation of Cytosolic RNA-Sensing Signaling Pathways to Protect the Liver from Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury.,"Excessive inflammation resulting from activation of the innate immune system significantly contributes to ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI). Inflammatory reactions in both IRI and infections share the same signaling pathways evoked by danger/pathogen associated molecular pattern molecules. The cytosolic retinoid-inducible gene I(RIG-I)-like RNA receptor (RLR) RNA sensing pathway mediates type I IFN production during viral infection and the sensing of viral RNA is regulated by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1). Using a model of liver IRI, we provide evidence that ADAR1 also regulates cytosolic RNA-sensing pathways in the setting of ischemic stress. Suppression of ADAR1 significantly enhanced inflammation and liver damage following IRI, which was accompanied by significant increases in type I IFN through cytosolic RNA-sensing pathways. In addition, knocking ADAR1 down in hepatocytes exaggerates inflammatory signaling to dsRNA or endotoxin and results in over production of type I IFN, which could be abolished by the interruption of RIG-I. Therefore, we identified a novel ADAR1-dependent protective contribution through which hepatocytes guard against aberrant cytosolic RLR-RNA-sensing pathway mediated inflammatory reaction in response to acute liver IR. ADAR1 protects against over activation of viral RNA-sensing pathways in non-infectious tissue stress.",2016 Feb 1,Sci Rep. 2016 Feb 1;6:20248. doi: 10.1038/srep20248.,"['Wang H', 'Wang G', 'Zhang L', 'Zhang J', 'Zhang J', 'Wang Q', 'Billiar TR']",True

The aim of the study was to investigate whether PKR is involved in hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) induced neonatal cardiac myocytes (NCM) injury. In our study, NCM, when exposed to H(2)O(2), resulted in persistent activation of PKR due to NCM endogenous RNA. Inhibition of PKR by 2-aminopurine (2-AP) or siRNA protected against H(2)O(2) induced apoptosis and injury. To elucidate the mechanism, we revealed that inhibition of PKR alleviated H(2)O(2) induced apoptosis companied by decreased caspase3/7 activity, BAX and caspase-3 expression. We also revealed that inhibition of PKR suppressed H(2)O(2) induced NFκB pathway and NLRP3 activation. Finally, we found ADAR1 mRNA and protein expression were both induced after H(2)O(2) treatment through STAT-2 dependent pathway. By gain and loss of ADAR1 expression, we confirmed ADAR1 modulated PKR activity. Therefore, we concluded inhibition of PKR protected against H(2)O(2)-induced injury by attenuating apoptosis and inflammation. A self-preservation mechanism existed in NCM that ADAR1 expression is induced by H(2)O(2) to limit PKR activation simultaneously.

In a gastric cancer tissue microarray, ADAR1 staining was closely correlated with tumor stage (P < 0.001) and N classification (P < 0.001). Functional analysis indicated that ADAR1 overexpression promoted cell proliferation and migration in vitro, whereas ADAR1 knockdown resulted in an opposite phenotypes. Furthermore, ADAR1 knockdown also inhibited tumorigenicity and lung metastasis potential of gastric cancer cells in nude mice models. Mechanistically, ADAR1 expression had a significant effect on phosphorylation level of mTOR, p70S kinase, and S6 ribosomal protein, implying its involvement in the regulation of mTOR signaling pathway. We conclude that ADAR1 contributes to gastric cancer development and progression via activating mTOR/p70S6K/S6 ribosomal protein signaling axis. Our findings suggest that ADAR1 may be a valuable biomarker for GC diagnosis and prognosis and may represent a new novel therapeutic opportunities.",2016 Dec 27,Oncotarget. 2016 Dec 27;7(52):86161-86173. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.13354.,"['Dou N', 'Yu S', 'Ye X', 'Yang D', 'Li Y', 'Gao Y']",True
27999332,Functions of the RNA Editing Enzyme ADAR1 and Their Relevance to Human Diseases.,"Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) convert adenosine to inosine in double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Among the three types of mammalian ADARs, ADAR1 has long been recognized as an essential enzyme for normal development. The interferon-inducible ADAR1p150 is involved in immune responses to both exogenous and endogenous triggers, whereas the functions of the constitutively expressed ADAR1p110 are variable. Recent findings that ADAR1 is involved in the recognition of self versus non-self dsRNA provide potential explanations for its links to hematopoiesis, type I interferonopathies, and viral infections. Editing in both coding and noncoding sequences results in diseases ranging from cancers to neurological abnormalities. Furthermore, editing of noncoding sequences, like microRNAs, can regulate protein expression, while editing of Alu sequences can affect translational efficiency and editing of proximal sequences. Novel identifications of long noncoding RNA and retrotransposons as editing targets further expand the effects of A-to-I editing. Besides editing, ADAR1 also interacts with other dsRNA-binding proteins in editing-independent manners. Elucidating the disease-specific patterns of editing and/or ADAR1 expression may be useful in making diagnoses and prognoses. In this review, we relate the mechanisms of ADAR1's actions to its pathological implications, and suggest possible mechanisms for the unexplained associations between ADAR1 and human diseases.",2016 Dec 17,Genes (Basel). 2016 Dec 17;7(12):129. doi: 10.3390/genes7120129.,"['Song C', 'Sakurai M', 'Shiromoto Y', 'Nishikura K']",True
27557710,An efficient system for selectively altering genetic information within mRNAs.,"Site-directed RNA editing (SDRE) is a strategy to precisely alter genetic information within mRNAs. By linking the catalytic domain of the RNA editing enzyme ADAR to an antisense guide RNA, specific adenosines can be converted to inosines, biological mimics for guanosine. Previously, we showed that a genetically encoded iteration of SDRE could target adenosines expressed in human cells, but not efficiently. Here we developed a reporter assay to quantify editing, and used it to improve our strategy. By enhancing the linkage between ADAR's catalytic domain and the guide RNA, and by introducing a mutation in the catalytic domain, the efficiency of converting a U A: G premature termination codon (PTC) to tryptophan (U G: G) was improved from ∼11 % to ∼70 %. Other PTCs were edited, but less efficiently. Numerous off-target edits were identified in the targeted mRNA, but not in randomly selected endogenous messages. Off-target edits could be eliminated by reducing the amount of guide RNA with a reduction in on-target editing. The catalytic rate of SDRE was compared with those for human ADARs on various substrates and found to be within an order of magnitude of most. These data underscore the promise of site-directed RNA editing as a therapeutic or experimental tool.",2016 Dec 1,Nucleic Acids Res. 2016 Dec 1;44(21):e157. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkw738.

27643693,"Neurologic Phenotypes Associated with Mutations in TREX1, RNASEH2A, RNASEH2B, RNASEH2C, SAMHD1, ADAR1, and IFIH1: Aicardi-Goutières Syndrome and Beyond.","The Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS) was first described in 1984, and over the following years was defined by the clinical and radiological features of an early onset, severe, neurologic disorder with intracranial calcification, leukoencephalopathy, and cerebral atrophy, usually associated with a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis and elevated CSF interferon α activity. It is now recognized that mutations in any of the following seven genes may result in the classical AGS phenotype: TREX1 (AGS1), RNASEH2A (AGS2), RNASEH2B (AGS3), RNASEH2C (AGS4), SAMHD1 (AGS5), ADAR1 (AGS6), and IFIH1 (AGS7). All of these genes encode proteins involved in nucleotide metabolism and/or sensing. Mutations in these genes result in the induction of type 1 interferon production and an upregulation of interferon stimulated genes. As more patients harboring mutations in these genes have been described, in particular facilitated by the advent of whole exome sequencing, a remarkably broad spectrum of associated neurologic phenotypes has been revealed, which we summarize here. We propose that the term AGS has continued clinical utility in the designation of a characteristic phenotype, which suggests relevant diagnostic investigations and can inform outcome predictions. However, we also suggest that the use of the term ""type 1 interferonopathy"" is appropriate for the wider spectrum of disease consequent upon dysfunction of these genes and proteins since it implies the possibility of a common ""anti-interferon"" approach to therapy as such treatments become available.",2016 Dec,Neuropediatrics. 2016 Dec;47(6):355-360. doi: 10.1055/s-0036-1592307.

27435341,Link Prediction on a Network of Co-occurring MeSH Terms: Towards Literature-based Discovery.,"OBJECTIVES: Literature-based discovery (LBD) is a text mining methodology for automatically generating research hypotheses from existing knowledge. We mimic the process of LBD as a classification problem on a graph of MeSH terms. We employ unsupervised and supervised link prediction methods for predicting previously unknown connections between biomedical concepts. METHODS: We evaluate the effectiveness of link prediction through a series of experiments using a MeSH network that contains the history of link formation between biomedical concepts. We performed link prediction using proximity measures, such as common neighbor (CN), Jaccard coefficient (JC), Adamic / Adar index (AA) and preferential attachment (PA). Our approach relies on the assumption that similar nodes are more likely to establish a link in the future. RESULTS: Applying an unsupervised approach, the AA measure achieved the best performance in terms of area under the ROC curve (AUC = 0.76), followed by CN, JC, and PA. In a supervised approach, we evaluate whether proximity measures can be combined to define a model of link formation across all four predictors. We applied various classifiers, including decision trees, k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, multilayer perceptron, naïve Bayes, and random forests. Random forest classifier accomplishes the best performance (AUC = 0.87). CONCLUSIONS: The link prediction approach proved to be effective for LBD processing.

However, ADAR1 editase-dependent mechanisms governing leukemia stem cell (LSC) generation have not been elucidated. In blast crisis chronic myeloid leukemia (BC CML), we show that increased JAK2 signaling and BCR-ABL1 amplification activate ADAR1. In a humanized BC CML mouse model, combined JAK2 and BCR-ABL1 inhibition prevents LSC self-renewal commensurate with ADAR1 downregulation. Lentiviral ADAR1 wild-type, but not an editing-defective ADAR1(E912A) mutant, induces self-renewal gene expression and impairs biogenesis of stem cell regulatory let-7 microRNAs. Combined RNA sequencing, qRT-PCR, CLIP-ADAR1, and pri-let-7 mutagenesis data suggest that ADAR1 promotes LSC generation via let-7 pri-microRNA editing and LIN28B upregulation. A small-molecule tool compound antagonizes ADAR1's effect on LSC self-renewal in stromal co-cultures and restores let-7 biogenesis.

27494846,ADAR1 is vital for B cell lineage development in the mouse bone marrow.,"Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) 1 is the master editor of the transcriptome, catalyzing the conversion of adenosine to inosine (A-to-I). RNA transcripts fold into a variety of secondary structures including long intramolecular RNA duplexes that are the major substrate of ADAR1. Most A-to-I editing sites occur within RNA duplexes formed by complementary pairing of inverted retrotransposable elements interspersed within noncoding regions of transcripts. This catalytic activity of ADAR1 most likely prevents the abnormal activation of cytosolic nucleic acid sensors by self-dsRNAs. Homozygous disruption of mouse Adar is embryonic lethal due to a toxic type-I interferons response and correspondingly biallelic missense mutations in human ADAR1 cause a severe congenital interferonopathy. Here, we report that Cd19-Cre-mediated Adar gene ablation in the mouse causes a significant defect in the final stages of B cell development with an almost complete absence of newly formed immature and CD23+ mature recirculating B cells in the BM. Adar ablation in pre-B cells induced upregulation of typical interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and apoptosis upon further maturation. ADAR1 deficiency also inhibited the in vitro, IL-7-mediated, differentiation of BM-derived B cell precursors.

There is a need to discover new potential actionable genetic lesions, to which end, non-conventional cancer pathways, such as RNA editing, are worth exploring. Herein we show that the adenosine-to-inosine editing enzyme ADAR1 undergoes gene amplification in non-small cancer cell lines and primary tumors in association with higher levels of the corresponding mRNA and protein. From a growth and invasion standpoint, the depletion of ADAR1 expression in amplified cells reduces their tumorigenic potential in cell culture and mouse models, whereas its overexpression has the opposite effects. From a functional perspective, ADAR1 overexpression enhances the editing frequencies of target transcripts such as NEIL1 and miR-381. In the clinical setting, patients with early-stage lung cancer, but harboring ADAR1 gene amplification, have poor outcomes.

27446352,Splicing variants of ADAR2 and ADAR2-mediated RNA editing in glioma.,"The roles of alternative splicing and RNA editing in gene regulation and transcriptome diversity are well documented. Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) are responsible for adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing and exemplify the complex association between RNA editing and alternative splicing. The self-editing activity of ADAR2, which acts on its own pre-mRNA, leads to its alternative splicing. Alternative splicing occurs independently at nine splicing sites on ADAR2 pre-mRNA, generating numerous alternative splicing variants with various catalytic activities. A-to-I RNA editing is important in a range of physiological processes in humans and is associated with several diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, mood disorders, epilepsy and glioma. Reduced editing at the glutamine/arginine site of the AMPA receptor subunit GluA2 in glioma, without any alteration in ADAR2 expression, is a notable phenomenon. Several studies have tried to explain this alteration in the catalytic activity of ADAR2; however, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. The present review summarizes the relevant literature and shares experimental results concerning ADAR2 alternative splicing. In particular, the present review demonstrates that shifts in the relative abundance of the active and inactive splicing variants of ADAR2 may reduce the ADAR2 editing activity in glioma. Dominant expression of ADAR2 splicing variant with low enzyme activity causes reduced RNA editing of GluA2 subunit at the glutamine/arginine site in glioma.",2016 Aug,Oncol Lett. 2016 Aug;12(2):788-792. doi: 10.3892/ol.2016.4734.

Common carp is a host for spring viraemia of carp virus (Rhabdovirus carpio, SVCV), which belong to Rhabdoviridae family. The present in-vivo experiment was conducted to investigate the expression of these innate immune factors in early phase as well as during recovery of SVCV infection by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. A less lethal SVCV infection was generated in common carp (Cyprinus carpio) and was sampled at 3, 6, 12 h post infection (hpi), 1, 3, 5, 7 and 10 days post infection (dpi).

RNA secondary structure and the temporal expression of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) contribute to cis- and trans-regulatory mechanisms of these RNA editing patterns, respectively. Interestingly, the increasing pattern was associated with neuronal maturation, correlated with mRNA abundance and potentially influenced miRNA binding energy.

To confirm A-to-I editing of PUK1 transcripts, strand-specific RNA-seq data were generated with RNA isolated from conidia, hyphae, and perithecia. PUK1 was almost specifically expressed in perithecia, and 90% of transcripts were edited to UG(1831)GUG(1834)G. Genome-wide analysis identified 26,056 perithecium-specific A-to-I editing sites.

27362848,Evidence of an Exponential Decay Pattern of the Hepatitis Delta Virus Evolution Rate and Fluctuations in Quasispecies Complexity in Long-Term Studies of Chronic Delta Infection.,"Chronic HDV infection can cause a severe form of viral hepatitis for which there is no specific treatment. Characterization of the hepatitis B or C viral quasispecies has provided insight into treatment failure and disease recurrence following liver transplantation, has proven useful to understand hepatitis B e antigen seroconversion, and has helped to predict whether hepatitis C infection will resolve or become chronic. It is likely that characterization of the hepatitis delta virus (HDV) quasispecies will ultimately have similar value for the management of this infection. This study sought to determine the RNA evolution rates in serum of chronic hepatitis delta (CHD) treatment-naïve patients, using next-generation sequencing methods. The region selected for study encompassed nucleotide positions 910 to 1270 of the genome and included the amber/W codon. Amber/W is a substrate of the editing process by the ADAR1 host enzyme and is essential for encoding the 2 delta antigens (HDAg). The amber codon encodes the small (unedited) HDAg form and the W codon the large (edited) HDAg form. The evolution rate was analyzed taking into account the time elapsed between samples, the percentage of unedited and edited genomes, and the complexity of the viral population. The longitudinal studies included 29 sequential samples from CHD patients followed up for a mean of 11.5 years. In total, 121,116 sequences were analyzed. The HDV evolution rate ranged from 9.5x10-3 to 1.2x10-3 substitutions/site/year and showed a negative correlation with the time elapsed between samples (p<0.05). An accumulation of transition-type changes was found to be responsible for higher evolution rates.

27602277,Effects of social isolation and re-socialization on cognition and ADAR1 (p110) expression in mice.,"It has been reported that social isolation stress could be a key factor that leads to cognitive deficit for both humans and rodent models. However, detailed mechanisms are not yet clear. ADAR1 (Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA) is an enzyme involved in RNA editing that has a close relation to cognitive function. We have hypothesized that social isolation stress may impact the expression of ADAR1 in the brain of mice with cognitive deficit. To test our hypothesis, we evaluated the cognition ability of mice isolated for different durations (2, 4, and 8 weeks) using object recognition and object location tests; we also measured ADAR1 expression in hippocampus and cortex using immunohistochemistry and western blot. Our study showed that social isolation stress induced spatial and non-spatial cognition deficits of the tested mice. In addition, social isolation significantly increased both the immunoreactivity and protein expression of ADAR1 (p110) in the hippocampus and frontal cortex. Furthermore, re-socialization could not only recover the cognition deficits, but also bring ADAR1 (p110) immunoreactivity of hippocampus and frontal cortex, as well as ADAR1 (p110) protein expression of hippocampus back to the normal level for the isolated mice in adolescence. In conclusion, social isolation stress significantly increases ADAR1 (p110) expression in the hippocampus and frontal cortex of the mice with cognitive deficit. This finding may open a window to better understand the reasons (e.g., epigenetic change) that are responsible for social isolation-induced cognitive deficit and help the development of novel therapies for the resulted diseases.",2016,PeerJ. 2016 Aug 18;4:e2306. doi: 10.7717/peerj.2306. eCollection 2016.,"['Chen W', 'An D', 'Xu H', 'Cheng X', 'Wang S', 'Yu W', 'Yu D', 'Zhao D', 'Sun Y', 'Deng W', 'Tang Y', 'Yin S']",True
26463388,Genome-Wide Analysis of A-to-I RNA Editing.,"Adenosine (A)-to-inosine (I) RNA editing is a fundamental posttranscriptional modification that ensures the deamination of A-to-I in double-stranded (ds) RNA molecules. Intriguingly, the A-to-I RNA editing system is particularly active in the nervous system of higher eukaryotes, altering a plethora of noncoding and coding sequences. Abnormal RNA editing is highly associated with many neurological phenotypes and neurodevelopmental disorders. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying RNA editing-mediated pathogenesis still remain enigmatic and have attracted increasing attention from researchers. Over the last decade, methods available to perform genome-wide transcriptome analysis, have evolved rapidly. Within the RNA editing field researchers have adopted next-generation sequencing technologies to identify RNA-editing sites within genomes and to elucidate the underlying process. However, technical challenges associated with editing site discovery have hindered efforts to uncover comprehensive editing site datasets, resulting in the general perception that the collections of annotated editing sites represent only a small minority of the total number of sites in a given organism, tissue, or cell type of interest. Additionally to doubts about sensitivity, existing RNA-editing site lists often contain high percentages of false positives, leading to uncertainty about their validity and usefulness in downstream studies. An accurate investigation of A-to-I editing requires properly validated datasets of editing sites with demonstrated and transparent levels of sensitivity and specificity. Here, we describe a high signal-to-noise method for RNA-editing site detection using single-molecule sequencing (SMS). With this method, authentic RNA-editing sites may be differentiated from artifacts. Machine learning approaches provide a procedure to improve upon and experimentally validate sequencing outcomes through use of computationally predicted, iterative feedback loops. Subsequent use of extensive Sanger sequencing validations can generate accurate editing site lists. This approach has broad application and accurate genome-wide editing analysis of various tissues from clinical specimens or various experimental organisms is now a possibility.",2016,Methods Mol Biol. 2016;1358:255-68. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4939-3067-8_15.,"['Savva YA', 'Laurent GS', 'Reenan RA']",True
27256387,Controlling the Editor: The Many Roles of RNA-Binding Proteins in Regulating A-to-I RNA Editing.,"RNA editing is a cellular process used to expand and diversify the RNA transcripts produced from a generally immutable genome. In animals, the most prevalent type of RNA editing is adenosine (A) to inosine (I) deamination catalyzed by the ADAR family. Throughout development, A-to-I editing levels increase while ADAR expression is constant, suggesting cellular mechanisms to regulate A-to-I editing exist. Furthermore, in several disease states, ADAR expression levels are similar to the normal state, but A-to-I editing levels are altered. Therefore, understanding how these enzymes are regulated in normal tissues and misregulated in disease states is of profound importance. This chapter will both discuss how to identify A-to-I editing sites across the transcriptome and explore the mechanisms that regulate ADAR editing activity, with particular focus on the diverse types of RNA-binding proteins implicated in regulating A-to-I editing in vivo.",2016,Adv Exp Med Biol. 2016;907:189-213. doi: 10.1007/978-3-319-29073-7_8.,"['Washburn MC', 'Hundley HA']",True

In addition to RNA editing, additional functions have been proposed for ADAR1. To determine the specific role of RNA editing by ADAR1, we generated mice with an editing-deficient knock-in mutation (Adar1(E861A), where E861A denotes Glu(861)→Ala(861)). Adar1(E861A/E861A) embryos died at ~E13.5 (embryonic day 13.5), with activated interferon and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-sensing pathways. Genome-wide analysis of the in vivo substrates of ADAR1 identified clustered hyperediting within long dsRNA stem loops within 3' untranslated regions of endogenous transcripts. Finally, embryonic death and phenotypes of Adar1(E861A/E861A) were rescued by concurrent deletion of the cytosolic sensor of dsRNA, MDA5. A-to-I editing of endogenous dsRNA is the essential function of ADAR1, preventing the activation of the cytosolic dsRNA response by endogenous transcripts.",2015 Sep 4,Science. 2015 Sep 4;349(6252):1115-20. doi: 10.1126/science.aac7049.

26437436,New Insights into the Biological Role of Mammalian ADARs; the RNA Editing Proteins.,"The ADAR proteins deaminate adenosine to inosine in double-stranded RNA which is one of the most abundant modifications present in mammalian RNA. Inosine can have a profound effect on the RNAs that are edited, not only changing the base-pairing properties, but can also result in recoding, as inosine behaves as if it were guanosine. In mammals there are three ADAR proteins and two ADAR-related proteins (ADAD) expressed. All have a very similar modular structure; however, both their expression and biological function differ significantly. Only two of the ADAR proteins have enzymatic activity. However, both ADAR and ADAD proteins possess the ability to bind double-strand RNA. Mutations in ADARs have been associated with many diseases ranging from cancer, innate immunity to neurological disorders. Here, we will discuss in detail the domain structure of mammalian ADARs, the effects of RNA editing, and the role of ADARs in human diseases.",2015 Sep 30,Biomolecules. 2015 Sep 30;5(4):2338-62. doi: 10.3390/biom5042338.,"['Mannion N', 'Arieti F', 'Gallo A', 'Keegan LP', ""O'Connell MA""]",True
26184879,Dynamic profiling of double-stranded RNA binding proteins.,"Double-stranded (ds) RNA is a key player in numerous biological activities in cells, including RNA interference, anti-viral immunity and mRNA transport. The class of proteins responsible for recognizing dsRNA is termed double-stranded RNA binding proteins (dsRBP). However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction between dsRBPs and dsRNA. Here we examined four human dsRBPs, ADAD2, TRBP, Staufen 1 and ADAR1 on six dsRNA substrates that vary in length and secondary structure. We combined single molecule pull-down (SiMPull), single molecule protein-induced fluorescence enhancement (smPIFE) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the dsRNA-dsRBP interactions. Our results demonstrate that despite the highly conserved dsRNA binding domains, the dsRBPs exhibit diverse substrate specificities and dynamic properties when in contact with different RNA substrates. While TRBP and ADAR1 have a preference for binding simple duplex RNA, ADAD2 and Staufen1 display higher affinity to highly structured RNA substrates. Upon interaction with RNA substrates, TRBP and Staufen1 exhibit dynamic sliding whereas two deaminases ADAR1 and ADAD2 mostly remain immobile when bound. MD simulations provide a detailed atomic interaction map that is largely consistent with the affinity differences observed experimentally. Collectively, our study highlights the diverse nature of substrate specificity and mobility exhibited by dsRBPs that may be critical for their cellular function.",2015 Sep 3,Nucleic Acids Res. 2015 Sep 3;43(15):7566-76. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkv726.

Although the fine-tuning mechanism provided by A-to-I RNA editing is important, the underlying rules governing ADAR substrate recognition are not well understood. We apply a quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping approach to identify genetic variants associated with variability in RNA editing. With very accurate measurement of RNA editing levels at 789 sites in 131 Drosophila melanogaster strains, here we identify 545 editing QTLs (edQTLs) associated with differences in RNA editing. We demonstrate that many edQTLs can act through changes in the local secondary structure for edited dsRNAs. Furthermore, we find that edQTLs located outside of the edited dsRNA duplex are enriched in secondary structure, suggesting that distal dsRNA structure beyond the editing site duplex affects RNA editing efficiency.

26252972,Effect of mismatch on binding of ADAR2/GluR-2 pre-mRNA complex.,"RNA editing plays an important role in realizing the full potential of a given genome. Different from RNA splicing, RNA editing fine-tunes the sequence of RNA by changing only one or two nucleotides. A-I editing [deamination of adenosine (A) to create inosine (I)] is best characterized in mammals and occurs in the regions of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) are members of a family of enzymes involved in A-I deamination editing in numerous mRNA and pre-mRNA transcripts. Experimental study shows that ADAR2 selectively edits the R/G site, while ADAR1 edits more promiscuously at several other adenosines. How ADAR2 selects specific sites for deamination is poorly understood. Mismatches have been suggested to be important factors that allow the ADAR2 to achieve specific deamination. Using molecular dynamic simulation, we studied the effect of mismatch on binding stability of the dsRNA/ADAR2 complex. By comparison of two binding domains of ADAR2, we found that ADAR2 dsRBM2 (second binding domain of ADAR2) does not bind well with mismatch reversed GluR-2 RNA. When mismatch is reversed, dsRBM2 of ADAR2 slides along the RNA duplex in the simulation. Detailed structural analysis indicates that the minor groove width of dsRNA and global shape of RNA may play an important role in the specific reading mechanism of ADAR2.",2015 Sep,J Mol Model. 2015 Sep;21(9):222. doi: 10.1007/s00894-015-2760-8.

Recently, we have demonstrated that the RNA editing protein, adenosine deaminase acting on RNA-1 (ADAR1) is down-regulated during metastatic transition of melanoma, which enhances melanoma cell proliferation and tumorigenicity. Here we investigate the role of ADAR1 in melanoma immune resistance.Importantly, knockdown of ADAR1 in human melanoma cells induces resistance to tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in a cell contact-dependent mechanism. We show that ADAR1, in an editing-independent manner, regulates the biogenesis of miR-222 at the transcription level and thereby Intercellular Adhesion Molecule 1 (ICAM1) expression, which consequently affects melanoma immune resistance. ADAR1 thus has a novel, pivotal, role in cancer immune resistance. Corroborating with these results, the expression of miR-222 in melanoma tissue specimens was significantly higher in patients who had no clinical benefit from treatment with ipilimumab as compared to patients that responded clinically, suggesting that miR-222 could function as a biomarker for the prediction of response to ipilimumab.These results provide not only novel insights on melanoma immune resistance, but also pave the way to the development of innovative personalized tools to enable optimal drug selection and treatment.",2015 Oct 6,Oncotarget. 2015 Oct 6;6(30):28999-9015. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.4905.,"['Galore-Haskel G', 'Nemlich Y', 'Greenberg E', 'Ashkenazi S', 'Hakim M', 'Itzhaki O', 'Shoshani N', 'Shapira-Fromer R', 'Ben-Ami E', 'Ofek E', 'Anafi L', 'Besser MJ', 'Schachter J', 'Markel G']",True
26093149,Chimira: analysis of small RNA sequencing data and microRNA modifications.,"Chimira is a web-based system for microRNA (miRNA) analysis from small RNA-Seq data. Sequences are automatically cleaned, trimmed, size selected and mapped directly to miRNA hairpin sequences. This generates count-based miRNA expression data for subsequent statistical analysis. Moreover, it is capable of identifying epi-transcriptomic modifications in the input sequences. Supported modification types include multiple types of 3'-modifications (e.g. uridylation, adenylation), 5'-modifications and also internal modifications or variation (ADAR editing or single nucleotide polymorphisms). Besides cleaning and mapping of input sequences to miRNAs, Chimira provides a simple and intuitive set of tools for the analysis and interpretation of the results (see also Supplementary Material). These allow the visual study of the differential expression between two specific samples or sets of samples, the identification of the most highly expressed miRNAs within sample pairs (or sets of samples) and also the projection of the modification profile for specific miRNAs across all samples. Other tools have already been published in the past for various types of small RNA-Seq analysis, such as UEA workbench, seqBuster, MAGI, OASIS and CAP-miRSeq, CPSS for modifications identification. A comprehensive comparison of Chimira with each of these tools is provided in the Supplementary Material. Chimira outperforms all of these tools in total execution speed and aims to facilitate simple, fast and reliable analysis of small RNA-Seq data allowing also, for the first time, identification of global microRNA modification profiles in a simple intuitive interface.

Loci-specific ""editabilities,"" i.e., propensities to be edited by ADAR, were quantifiable by fitting the logistic function to dose-response data. The editing frequency was increased in tumor cells in comparison to normal controls.

26051678,RNA editing of non-coding RNA and its role in gene regulation.,"It has for a long time been known that repetitive elements, particularly Alu sequences in human, are edited by the adenosine deaminases acting on RNA, ADAR, family. The functional interpretation of these events has been even more difficult than that of editing events in coding sequences, but today there is an emerging understanding of their downstream effects. A surprisingly large fraction of the human transcriptome contains inverted Alu repeats, often forming long double stranded structures in RNA transcripts, typically occurring in introns and UTRs of protein coding genes. Alu repeats are also common in other primates, and similar inverted repeats can frequently be found in non-primates, although the latter are less prone to duplex formation. In human, as many as 700,000 Alu elements have been identified as substrates for RNA editing, of which many are edited at several sites. In fact, recent advancements in transcriptome sequencing techniques and bioinformatics have revealed that the human editome comprises at least a hundred million adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) editing sites in Alu sequences.

Serotonin 2C receptor (HTR2C) is encoded through combinatorial A-to-I RNA editing at recoding sites (A - E site) on its pre-mRNA. Although the efficiency of RNA editing at particular sites is known to be critical for modulating the serotonin signaling, the mechanistic details of site-specific editing on HTR2C pre-mRNA are not fully understood. Toward complete understanding of this mechanism, we discovered an RNA element, which coordinates site-specific RNA editing on HTR2C pre-mRNA by an in vitro editing assay and secondary structural analysis of mutant HTR2C RNA fragments. Our results showed that HTR2C pre-mRNA forms a characteristic structure, which was restricted by the internal loop and Watson-Crick base-pair interaction on site E, for intrinsic editing.

In this study, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and multiple haplotypes in several candidate genes were analyzed for associations with more than one rubella-specific immune response outcome, including secreted IFN-γ, secreted IL-6, and neutralizing antibody titers. Overall, we identified 23 SNPs in 10 different genes that were significantly associated with at least two rubella-specific immune responses. Of these SNPs, we detected eight in the PVRL3 gene, five in the PVRL1 gene, one in the TRIM22 gene, two in the IL10RB gene, two in the TLR4 gene, and five in other genes (PVR, ADAR, ZFP57, MX1, and BTN2A1/BTN3A3).

Earlier, we reported a phenotypic screen for the study of human ADAR2 using budding yeast S. cerevisiae as the host system. While this screen has been successfully applied to the study of ADAR2, it failed with ADAR1. Here, we report a new reporter that uses a novel editing substrate and is suitable for the study of ADAR1. We screened plasmid libraries with randomized codons for two important residues in human ADAR1 (G1007 and E1008). The screening results combined with in vitro deamination assays led to the identification of mutants that are more active than the wild type protein. Furthermore, a screen of the ADAR1 E1008X library with a reporter construct bearing an A•G mismatch at the editing site suggests one role for the residue at position 1008 is to sense the identity of the base pairing partner for the editing site adenosine.

Even though mango is an economically important crop, most of the studies on diversity in mango collections have been conducted with a small number of genetic markers. RESULTS: We describe a de novo transcriptome assembly from mango cultivar 'Keitt'. Variation discovery was performed using Illumina resequencing of 'Keitt' and 'Tommy Atkins' cultivars identified 332,016 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 1903 simple-sequence repeats (SSRs). Most of the SSRs (70.1%) were of trinucleotide with the preponderance of motif (GGA/AAG)n and only 23.5% were di-nucleotide SSRs with the mostly of (AT/AT)n motif. Further investigation of the diversity in the Israeli mango collection was performed based on a subset of 293 SNPs. Those markers have divided the Israeli mango collection into two major groups: one group included mostly mango accessions from Southeast Asia (Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia) and India and the other with mainly of Floridian and Israeli mango cultivars. The latter group was more polymorphic (FS=-0.1 on the average) and was more of an admixture than the former group. A slight population differentiation was detected (FST=0.03), suggesting that if the mango accessions of the western world apparently was originated from Southeast Asia, as has been previously suggested, the duration of cultivation was not long enough to develop a distinct genetic background. CONCLUSIONS: Whole-transcriptome reconstruction was used to significantly broaden the mango's genetic variation resources, i.e., SNPs and SSRs. The set of SNP markers described in this study is novel. A subset of SNPs was sampled to explore the Israeli mango collection and most of them were polymorphic in many mango accessions. Therefore, we believe that these SNPs will be valuable as they recapitulate and strengthen the history of mango diversity.",2015 Nov 14,BMC Plant Biol. 2015 Nov 14;15:277. doi: 10.1186/s12870-015-0663-6.,"['Sherman A', 'Rubinstein M', 'Eshed R', 'Benita M', 'Ish-Shalom M', 'Sharabi-Schwager M', 'Rozen A', 'Saada D', 'Cohen Y', 'Ophir R']",False
25349168,ADAR2-dependent GluA2 editing regulates cocaine seeking.,"Activation of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) in the nucleus accumbens is necessary for the reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behavior, an animal model of drug craving and relapse. AMPARs are tetrameric protein complexes that consist of GluA1-4 subunits, of which GluA2 imparts calcium permeability. Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 2 (ADAR2) is a nuclear enzyme that is essential for editing GluA2 pre-mRNA at Q/R site 607. Unedited GluA2(Q) subunits form calcium-permeable AMPARs (CP-AMPARs), whereas edited GluA2(R) subunits form calcium-impermeable channels (CI-AMPARs). Emerging evidence suggests that the reinstatement of cocaine seeking is associated with increased synaptic expression of CP-AMPARs in the nucleus accumbens. However, the role of GluA2 Q/R site editing and ADAR2 in cocaine seeking is unclear. In the present study, we investigated the effects of forced cocaine abstinence on GluA2 Q/R site editing and ADAR2 expression in the nucleus accumbens. Our results demonstrate that 7 days of cocaine abstinence is associated with decreased GluA2 Q/R site editing and reduced ADAR2 expression in the accumbens shell, but not core, of cocaine-experienced rats compared with yoked saline controls. To examine the functional significance of ADAR2 and GluA2 Q/R site editing in cocaine seeking, we used viral-mediated gene delivery to overexpress ADAR2b in the accumbens shell. Increased ADAR2b expression in the shell attenuated cocaine priming-induced reinstatement of drug seeking and was associated with increased GluA2 Q/R site editing and surface expression of GluA2-containing AMPARs. Taken together, these findings support the novel hypothesis that an increased contribution of accumbens shell CP-AMPARs containing unedited GluA2(Q) promotes cocaine seeking. Therefore, CP-AMPARs containing unedited GluA2(Q) represent a novel target for cocaine addiction pharmacotherapies.",2015 Nov,Mol Psychiatry. 2015 Nov;20(11):1460-6. doi: 10.1038/mp.2014.134.

The RNA editing enzyme ADAR1 plays an important role in physiology and pathology. Initially, we found that the ADAR1 p150 or p110 transcript levels were decreased in glioma cells compared with normal astrocyte cells. In contrast, protein levels of ADAR1 p110 were significantly upregulated in glioma tissues and cells. This expression pattern indicated translationally controlled regulation. We identified an 885-nt sequence that was located between AUG1 and AUG2 within the ADAR1 mRNA that exhibited IRES-like activity. Furthermore, we confirmed that the translational mode of ADAR1 p110 was mediated by PTBP1 in glioma cells. The protein levels of PTBP1 and ADAR1 were cooperatively expressed in glioma tissues and cells. Knocking down ADAR1 p110 significantly decreased cell proliferation in three types of glioma cells (T98G, U87MG and A172). The removal of a minimal IRES-like sequence in a p150-overexpression construct could effectively abolish p110 induction and resulted in the slight suppression of cell proliferation compared with ADAR1-p150 overexpression in siPTBP1-treated T98G cells. In summary, our study revealed a mechanism whereby ADAR1 p110 can be activated by PTBP1 through an IRES-like element in glioma cells, and ADAR1 is essential for the maintenance of gliomagenesis.",2015 Nov,Cell Mol Life Sci. 2015 Nov;72(22):4383-97. doi: 10.1007/s00018-015-1938-7.

26335850,STAT2-dependent induction of RNA adenosine deaminase ADAR1 by type I interferon differs between mouse and human cells in the requirement for STAT1.,"Expression of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA1 (ADAR1) is driven by alternative promoters. Promoter PA, activated by interferon (IFN), produces transcripts that encode the inducible p150 ADAR1 protein, whereas PB specifies the constitutively expressed p110 protein. We show using Stat1(-/-), Stat2(-/-) and IRF9(-/-) MEFs that induction of ADAR1 p150 occurs by STAT2- and IRF9-dependent signaling that is enhanced by, but not obligatorily dependent upon, STAT1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated STAT2 at the PA promoter in IFN-treated Stat1(-/-) cells, whereas IFN-treated wild-type cells showed both STAT1 and STAT2 bound at PA. By contrast, with human 2fTGH cells and mutants U3A or U6A, ADAR1 induction by IFN was dependent upon both STAT1 and STAT2. These results suggest that transcriptional activation of Adar1 by IFN occurs in the absence of STAT1 by a non-canonical STAT2-dependent pathway in mouse but not human cells.",2015 Nov,Virology. 2015 Nov;485:363-70. doi: 10.1016/j.virol.2015.08.001.

26384844,OsHV-1 countermeasures to the Pacific oyster's anti-viral response.,"The host-pathogen interactions between the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) and Ostreid herpesvirus type 1 (OsHV-1) are poorly characterised. Herpesviruses are a group of large, DNA viruses that are known to encode gene products that subvert their host's antiviral response. It is likely that OsHV-1 has also evolved similar strategies as its genome encodes genes with high homology to C. gigas inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs) and an interferon-stimulated gene (termed CH25H). The first objective of this study was to simultaneously investigate the expression of C. gigas and OsHV-1 genes that share high sequence homology during an acute infection. Comparison of apoptosis-related genes revealed that components of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway (TNF) were induced in response to OsHV-1 infection, but we failed to observe evidence of apoptosis using a combination of biochemical and molecular assays. IAPs encoded by OsHV-1 were highly expressed during the acute stage of infection and may explain why we didn't observe evidence of apoptosis. However, C. gigas must have an alternative mechanism to apoptosis for clearing OsHV-1 from infected gill cells as we observed a reduction in viral DNA between 27 and 54 h post-infection. The reduction of viral DNA in C. gigas gill cells occurred after the up-regulation of interferon-stimulated genes (viperin, PKR, ADAR). In a second objective, we manipulated the host's anti-viral response by injecting C. gigas with a small dose of poly I:C at the time of OsHV-1 infection. This small dose of poly I:C was unable to induce transcription of known antiviral effectors (ISGs), but these oysters were still capable of inhibiting OsHV-1 replication. This result suggests dsRNA induces an anti-viral response that is additional to the IFN-like pathway.",2015 Nov,Fish Shellfish Immunol. 2015 Nov;47(1):435-43. doi: 10.1016/j.fsi.2015.09.025.

In our previous work, we have cloned the complete genomic sequence of ADAR1 from grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella), named CiADAR1. In the process, we found a splicing isoform of CiADAR1 (CiADAR1-like). CiADAR1 and CiADAR1-like are possessed by different promoters but share a common exon 2. The complete genomic CiADAR1-like has 9 exons and 8 introns. Its full-length cDNA is comprised of a 5' UTR (417 bp), a 3' UTR (118 bp) and a 3324 bp-long ORF encoding a polypeptide of 1107 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence of CiADAR1-like contains two Z-DNA binding domains, three dsRNA binding motifs and a truncate catalytic domain. CiADAR1-like shared higher homology with Danio rerio ADAR1 and lower homology with HsADAR1-like in phylogenetic tree. qRT-PCR showed that CiADAR1-like were ubiquitously expressed and significantly up-regulated after stimulation with Poly I:C. Its mRNA reached the peak at 12 h post-stimulation in all tested tissues. Western-blotting experiment proved CiADAR1-like was factually expressed in C. idella kidney (CIK) cells. To further study the transcriptional regulatory mechanism of CiADAR1-like, we cloned its promoter sequence. CiADAR1-like promoter is 1173 bp in length containing 3 ISRE and 8 IRF-E. Subsequently, grass carp IRF1 (CiIRF1) and IRF3 (CiIRF3) were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 and purified by affinity chromatography with the Ni-NTA His-Bind Resin. In vitro, CiIRF1 and CiIRF3 were able to bind to CiADAR1-like promoter with high affinity in gel mobility shift assays, revealing that IRF1 and IRF3 could be the potential transcriptional regulatory factors for CiADAR1-like. In vivo, Co-transfection of pcDNA3.1-IRF1 (or pcDNA3.1-IRF3) with pGL3-CiADAR1-like promoter into CIK cells showed that both IRF1 and IRF3 significantly increased the luciferase activity, suggesting that they play a positive role in CiADAR1-like transcription.",2015 Nov,Fish Shellfish Immunol. 2015 Nov;47(1):535-44. doi: 10.1016/j.fsi.2015.09.040.

26442181,Repetitive elements regulate circular RNA biogenesis.,"It was long assumed that eukaryotic precursor mRNAs (pre-mRNAs) are almost always spliced to generate a linear mRNA that is subsequently translated to produce a protein. However, it is now clear that thousands of protein-coding genes can be non-canonically spliced to produce circular noncoding RNAs, some of which are expressed at much higher levels than their associated linear mRNAs. How then does the splicing machinery decide whether to generate a linear mRNA or a circular RNA? Recent work has revealed that intronic repetitive elements, including sequences derived from transposons, are critical regulators of this decision. In most cases, circular RNA biogenesis appears to be initiated when complementary sequences from 2 different introns base pair to one another. This brings the splice sites from the intervening exon(s) into close proximity and facilitates the backsplicing event that generates the circular RNA. As many pre-mRNAs contain multiple intronic repeats, distinct circular transcripts can be produced depending on which repeats base pair to one another. Intronic repeats are thus critical regulatory sequences that control the functional output of their host genes, and potentially cause the functions of protein-coding genes to be highly divergent across species.",2015 May-Jun,Mob Genet Elements. 2015 May 21;5(3):1-7. doi: 10.1080/2159256X.2015.1045682. eCollection 2015 May-Jun.,['Wilusz JE'],False

Editing levels at individual editing sites span a broad range and are mediated by both cis-acting elements (surrounding RNA sequence and secondary structure) and trans-acting factors. Here, we aim to determine the roles that cis-acting elements and trans-acting factors play in regulating editing levels. Using two closely related Drosophila species, D. melanogaster and D. sechellia, and their F1 hybrids, we dissect the effects of cis sequences from trans regulators on editing levels by comparing species-specific editing in parents and their hybrids. We report that cis sequence differences are largely responsible for editing level differences between these two Drosophila species.

METHODS: The lineage⁻ (Lin⁻) cells of ER-CreADAR1(lox/lox) mice and their ADAR1(lox/lox) counterparts were enriched by magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS) and then transduced with retrovirus carrying MSCV- MLL/AF9-IRES-GFP fusion gene. The efficiency of transduction was detected by flow cytometry, and equal number of GFP⁺ cells were transplanted into lethally irradiated recipient mice. The recipient mice were treated with tamoxifen at 48 hours after transplantation to induce ADAR1 knockout and divided into following groups: experimental group (ER-Cre;ADAR1(lox/lox)+tamoxifen), control groups ((1)ER-Cre;ADAR1(lox/lox)+vechile, (2)ADAR1(lox/lox)+tamoxifen, (3)ADAR1(lox/lox)+vechile). The percentage of GFP⁺ cells in peripheral blood was examined at 10, 15 and 20 days respectively after transplantation and the survival of the recipient mice was observed. In vitro study, ER-Cre;ADAR1(lox/lox) and ADAR1(lox/lox) AML cells were cultured and the apoptosis rates of these cells 48 hours after 4-hydroxytamoxifen treatment were examined. RESULTS: The ADAR1 deletion MLL-AF9 AML mouse model was successfully established. Deletion of ADAR1 could decrease the percentage of GFP⁺ cells in the peripheral blood and significantly prolong the survival rate of recipient mice（P<0.05）.

24832646,The coupling of vision with locomotion in cortical blindness.,"Maintaining or modifying the speed and direction of locomotion requires the coupling of the locomotion with the retinal optic flow that it generates. It is shown that this essential behavioral capability, which requires on-line neural control, is preserved in the cortically blind hemifield of a hemianope. In experiments, optic flow stimuli were presented to either the normal or blind hemifield while the patient was walking on a treadmill. Little difference was found between the hemifields with respect to the coupling (i.e. co-dependency) of optic flow detection with locomotion. Even in the cortically blind hemifield, faster walking resulted in the perceptual slowing of detected optic flow, and self-selected locomotion speeds demonstrated behavioral discrimination between different optic flow speeds. The results indicate that the processing of optic flow, and thereby on-line visuo-locomotor coupling, can take place along neural pathways that function without processing in Area V1, and thus in the absence of conscious intervention. These and earlier findings suggest that optic flow and object motion are processed in parallel along with correlated non-visual locomotion signals. Extrastriate interactions may be responsible for discounting the optical effects of locomotion on the perceived direction of object motion, and maintaining visually guided self-motion.",2015 May,Vision Res. 2015 May;110(Pt B):286-94. doi: 10.1016/j.visres.2014.04.015.

However, a complete understanding of endogenous dsRNA signaling is hindered by an incomplete annotation of dsRNA-producing genes. To identify dsRNAs expressed in Caenorhabditis elegans, we developed a bioinformatics pipeline that identifies dsRNA by detecting clustered RNA editing sites, which are strictly limited to long dsRNA substrates of Adenosine Deaminases that act on RNA (ADAR). We compared two alignment algorithms for mapping both unique and repetitive reads and detected as many as 664 editing-enriched regions (EERs) indicative of dsRNA loci. EERs are visually enriched on the distal arms of autosomes and are predicted to possess strong internal secondary structures as well as sequence complementarity with other EERs, indicative of both intramolecular and intermolecular duplexes. Most EERs were associated with protein-coding genes, with ∼1.7% of all C. elegans mRNAs containing an EER, located primarily in very long introns and in annotated, as well as unannotated, 3' UTRs. In addition to numerous EERs associated with coding genes, we identified a population of prospective noncoding EERs that were distant from protein-coding genes and that had little or no coding potential. Finally, subsets of EERs are differentially expressed during development as well as during starvation and infection with bacterial or fungal pathogens.

25855956,Transcriptome-wide identification of adenosine-to-inosine editing using the ICE-seq method.,"Inosine (I), a modified base found in the double-stranded regions of RNA in metazoans, has various roles in biological processes by modulating gene expression. Inosine is generated from adenosine (A) catalyzed by ADAR (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA) enzymes in a process called A-to-I RNA editing. As inosine is converted to guanosine (G) by reverse transcription, the editing sites can be identified by simply comparing cDNA sequences with the corresponding genomic sequence. One approach to screening I sites is by deep sequencing based on A-to-G conversion from genomic sequence to cDNA; however, this approach produces a high rate of false positives because it cannot efficiently eliminate G signals arising from inevitable mapping errors. To address this issue, we developed a biochemical method to identify inosines called inosine chemical erasing (ICE), which is based on cyanoethylation combined with reverse transcription. ICE was subsequently combined with deep sequencing (ICE-seq) for the reliable identification of transcriptome-wide A-to-I editing sites. Here we describe a protocol for the practical application of ICE-seq, which can be completed within 22 d, and which allows the accurate identification of transcriptome-wide A-to-I RNA editing sites.",2015 May,Nat Protoc. 2015 May;10(5):715-32. doi: 10.1038/nprot.2015.037.

We observe that binding of ADAR1 to 3' UTRs precludes binding by other factors, causing 3' UTR lengthening. Similarly, ADAR1 interacts with DROSHA and DGCR8 in the nucleus and possibly out-competes DGCR8 in primary miRNA binding, which enhances mature miRNA expression.

25980994,Autophagy in spinal motor neurons of conditional ADAR2-knockout mice: An implication for a role of calcium in increased autophagy flux in ALS.,"In the motor neurons of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients, an RNA editing enzyme called adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 2 (ADAR2) is down-regulated and consequently GluA2 mRNAs unedited at the Q/R site is expressed in contrast to normal motor neurons that express only GluA2 edited at this site. Motor neurons of the mice lacking ADAR2 undergo Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptor-mediated slow death. We investigated the spinal cords of conditional ADAR2-knockout mice modeling ALS for the involvement of autophagy. In the motor neurons of the early- and late-symptomatic-stage mice, LC3-immunopositivity or immunoreactivity for both LC3- and p62 was observed, whereas the presymptomatic-stage mice showed no LC3- or p62-immunoreactivity. Western blot analyses showed increased expression of autophagy associated proteins in the anterior horn of the early symptomatic-stage mice. Electron-microscopically, autophagy was observed in the motor neurons most frequently in the early-symptomatic-stage mice which showed the severest motor neuron degeneration. Increased autophagy flux was not recognized in the wild-type mice or AR2res (ADAR2(flox/flox)/VAChT-Cre. Fast/GluR-B(R)(/)(R)) mice having motor neurons genetically engineered to express normally edited GluA2 in the absence of ADAR2, which show normal Ca(2+)-permeability of the AMPA receptors in motor neurons. Significantly increased autophagy flux in the degenerating motor neurons of ADAR2-knockout mice likely resulted from Ca(2+) overload.",2015 Jun 26,Neurosci Lett. 2015 Jun 26;598:79-84. doi: 10.1016/j.neulet.2015.05.025.

25873329,Aberrant alternative splicing pattern of ADAR2 downregulates adenosine-to-inosine editing in glioma.,"Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing is the most common type of RNA editing in mammals, and is catalyzed by adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs). ADAR2 is the main enzyme responsible for A-to-I editing in humans, and A-to-I underediting at the glutamine (Q)/arginine (R) site of the glutamate receptor subunit B (GluR-B) is associated with the pathogenesis and invasiveness of glioma. The level of ADAR2 mRNA expression and the alternative splicing of the ADAR2 pre-mRNA both affect the catalytic activity of ADAR2. However, reports of ADAR2 mRNA expression in glioma are inconsistent. The mechanism regulating ADAR2 pre-mRNA splicing is also unknown. In this study, we explored the deregulation of A-to-I RNA editing in glioma. We confirmed the underediting at the Q/R site of GluR-B mRNA in the glioma cell lines U87, U251 and A172 compared with that in normal human astrocytes (NHAs) HA1800. However, we demonstrated with reverse transcription (RT-PCR) and quantitative PCR (qPCR) that the expression of ADAR2 mRNA was not significantly altered in the glioma cell lines. Three alternative splicing sites are utilized in the glioma cell lines and NHAs: the first, located between exons -1 and 1, causes the inclusion of exon 1a; the second causes the removal of exon 2, which encodes two double-stranded RNA-binding domains; and the third, located between exons 4 and 6, causes the inclusion of alternative exon 5a, introducing a 120-nucleotide coding Alu-repeat sequence in frame. However, the expression ratio of two types of transcripts (with and without exon 5a) was altered in the glioma cells. Transcripts with exon 5a, which generate an ADAR2 isoform with ~50% reduced activity, were predominantly expressed in the glioma cell lines, whereas transcripts without exon 5a were predominantly expressed in the NHAs. From these results, we conclude that this aberrant alternative splicing pattern of ADAR2 downregulates A-to-I editing in glioma.",2015 Jun,Oncol Rep. 2015 Jun;33(6):2845-52. doi: 10.3892/or.2015.3907.

25681076,Genome organization and transcriptional regulation of Adenosine Deaminase Acting on RNA gene 1 (ADAR1) in grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella).,"ADAR1, involved in A-to-I RNA editing, belongs to adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) family. A-to-I RNA editing is the most widespread editing phenomenon in higher eukaryotes. In the present study, we cloned and identified the full-length cDNA, complete genomic sequence and the promoter sequence of grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) ADAR1 (CiADAR1) by homology cloning strategy and genome walking. CiADAR1 full-length cDNA is comprised of a 5'UTR (43  bp), a 3'UTR (229 bp) and a 4179 bp ORF encoding a polypeptide of 1392 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence of CiADAR1 contains two Z-DNA binding domains, three dsRNA binding motifs and a conserved catalytic domain. The complete genomic CiADAR1 has 16 exons and 15 introns. Phylogenetic tree analysis revealed that CiADAR1 shared high homology with Danio rerio ADAR1 (DrADAR1). RT-PCR showed that CiADAR1 were ubiquitously expressed and significantly up-regulated after stimulation with poly I:C. In spleen and liver, CiADAR1 mRNA reached the peak at 12 h and maintained the highest level during 12-24 h post-injection. CiADAR1 promoter was found to be 1102 bp in length and divided into two distinct regions, the proximal region containing three putative interferon regulatory factor binding elements (IRF-E) and the distal region containing only one IRF-E. To further study the transcriptional regulatory mechanism of CiADAR1, grass carp IRF1 (CiIRF1) and IRF3 (CiIRF3) were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 and purified by affinity chromatography with the Ni-NTA His-Bind resin. Then, gel mobility shift assay was employed to analyze the affinity of CiADAR1 promoter sequence with CiIRF1 and CiIRF3 in vitro. The result revealed that CiIRF1 and CiIRF3 bound to CiADAR1 promoter with high affinity, indicating that IRF1 and IRF3 could be the potential transcriptional regulatory factor for CiADAR1. Co-transfection of pcDNA3.1-IRF1 (or pcDNA3.1-IRF3) with pGL3-CiADAR1 into C. idella kidney (CIK) cells showed that both IRF1 and IRF3 played a positive role in CiADAR1 transcription. In addition, the mutant assay revealed that the proximal region of CiADAR1 promoter is the main regulatory region in CiADAR1 transcription.",2015 Jun,Dev Comp Immunol. 2015 Jun;50(2):98-105. doi: 10.1016/j.dci.2015.02.006.

We examined the main and moderating effects of RNA editing (ADAR, ADARB1) and HTR2C genes, childhood trauma (CT), recent SLEs and psychiatric disorders as contributors to suicide attempt (SA) vulnerability. METHODS: Study included 165 suicide attempters and 188 suicide non-attempters, all diagnosed with one of major psychiatric disorders. CT and recent SLEs were assessed using Early Trauma Inventory-Self Report and List of Threatening Experiences Questionnaire, respectively. Selected ADAR and ADARB1 tag-variants, and HTR2C rs6318 were pre-screened for association with SA, while generalized linear models and backward selection were applied to identify individual and interacting SA risk factors. RESULTS: ADARB1 rs9983925 and rs4819035 and HTR2C rs6318 were associated with SA. The best minimal model found emotional abuse, recent SLEs, rs9983925 and rs6318 as independent SA risk factors, and general traumas as a factor moderating the effect of psychiatric disorders and emotional abuse.

26085659,The emerging role of RNA editing in plasticity.,"All true metazoans modify their RNAs by converting specific adenosine residues to inosine. Because inosine binds to cytosine, it is a biological mimic for guanosine. This subtle change, termed RNA editing, can have diverse effects on various RNA-mediated cellular pathways, including RNA interference, innate immunity, retrotransposon defense and messenger RNA recoding. Because RNA editing can be regulated, it is an ideal tool for increasing genetic diversity, adaptation and environmental acclimation. This review will cover the following themes related to RNA editing: (1) how it is used to modify different cellular RNAs, (2) how frequently it is used by different organisms to recode mRNA, (3) how specific recoding events regulate protein function, (4) how it is used in adaptation and (5) emerging evidence that it can be used for acclimation.

26080435,PRUNE2 is a human prostate cancer suppressor regulated by the intronic long noncoding RNA PCA3.,"Prostate cancer antigen 3 (PCA3) is the most specific prostate cancer biomarker but its function remains unknown. Here we identify PRUNE2, a target protein-coding gene variant, which harbors the PCA3 locus, thereby classifying PCA3 as an antisense intronic long noncoding (lnc)RNA. We show that PCA3 controls PRUNE2 levels via a unique regulatory mechanism involving formation of a PRUNE2/PCA3 double-stranded RNA that undergoes adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR)-dependent adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing. PRUNE2 expression or silencing in prostate cancer cells decreased and increased cell proliferation, respectively. Moreover, PRUNE2 and PCA3 elicited opposite effects on tumor growth in immunodeficient tumor-bearing mice. Coregulation and RNA editing of PRUNE2 and PCA3 were confirmed in human prostate cancer specimens, supporting the medical relevance of our findings.

26223940,Decrease of mRNA Editing after Spinal Cord Injury is Caused by Down-regulation of ADAR2 that is Triggered by Inflammatory Response.,"We recently showed that spinal cord injury (SCI) leads to a decrease in mRNA editing of serotonin receptor 2C (5-HT2CR) contributing to post-SCI spasticity. Here we study post-SCI mRNA editing and global gene expression using massively parallel sequencing. Evidence is presented that the decrease in 5-HT2CR editing is caused by down-regulation of adenosine deaminase ADAR2 and that editing of at least one other ADAR2 target, potassium channel Kv1.1, is decreased after SCI. Bayesian network analysis of genome-wide transcriptome data indicates that down-regulation of ADAR2 (1) is triggered by persistent inflammatory response to SCI that is associated with activation of microglia and (2) results in changes in neuronal gene expression that are likely to contribute both to post-SCI restoration of neuronal excitability and muscle spasms.

Experiments using substrate RNAs with adenosine analogues at editing sites are useful for defining features of the ADAR reaction mechanism. The reactivity of ADAR2 was evaluated with RNA containing the emissive adenosine analogue thieno[3,4-d]-6-aminopyrimidine ((th)A). This nucleoside was incorporated into a mimic of the glutamate receptor B (GluR B) mRNA R/G editing site. We found that (th)A is recognized by AMV reverse transcriptase as A, and is deaminated rapidly by human ADAR2 to give (th)I. Importantly, ADAR reaction progress can be monitored by following the deamination-induced change in fluorescence of the (th)A-modified RNA. The observed high (th)A reactivity adds to our understanding of the structural features that are necessary for an efficient hADAR2 reaction. Furthermore, the new fluorescent assay is expected to accelerate mechanistic studies of ADARs.",2015 Jul 20,Angew Chem Int Ed Engl. 2015 Jul 20;54(30):8713-6. doi: 10.1002/anie.201502070.

25673044,Overexpression of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 in chordoma tissues is associated with chordoma pathogenesis by reducing miR‑125a and miR‑10a expression.,"Chordoma is a rare, slow-growing primary malignant neoplasm of the axial skeleton, which arises from the remnants of the notochord. Emerging evidence suggests that microRNAs (miRs) are dysregulated in chordoma tissues and crucially involved in chordoma pathogenesis. In the present study, the expression of 11 candidate miRs were analyzed in chordoma tissues and miR-10a and miR-125a were found to be significantly downregulated compared with controls. Notably, the expression of the primary transcripts, pri-miR-125a and pri-miR-10a was unaltered, suggesting that disturbed microRNA expression may be induced by altered pri-miRNA processing. Previous studies have indicated that disturbed adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) expression is able to alter mRNA and miRNA adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) levels associated with cancer pathogenesis. Therefore, the expression of ADAR1 and ADAR2 was analyzed in chordoma tissues. It was found that ADAR1 was significantly overexpressed, which was accompanied by enhanced pre-miR-10a and pri-miR-125a A-to-I editing. These findings suggest that ADAR2 overexpression causes enhanced pre-miR-10a and pri-miR-125a A-to-I editing, which alters mature miR-10a and miR-125a expression and may contribute to chordoma pathogenesis.",2015 Jul,Mol Med Rep. 2015 Jul;12(1):93-8. doi: 10.3892/mmr.2015.3341.

Here we show that the EBV latency origin of replication (oriP) is transcribed bi-directionally during reactivation and that both leftward (oriPtLs) and rightward (oriPtRs) transcripts are largely localized in the nucleus. While the oriPtLs are most likely noncoding, at least some of the oriPtRs contain the BCRF1/vIL10 open reading frame. Nonetheless, oriPtR transcripts with long 5' untranslated regions may partially serve noncoding functions. Both oriPtL and oriPtR transcripts are expressed with late kinetics, and their expression is inhibited by phosphonoacetic acid. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis showed that oriPtLs and oriPtRs exhibited extensive ""hyperediting"" at their Family of Repeat (FR) regions. RNA secondary structure prediction revealed that the FR region of both oriPtLs and oriPtRs may form large evolutionarily conserved and thermodynamically stable hairpins. The double-stranded RNA-binding protein and RNA-editing enzyme ADAR was found to bind to oriPtLs, likely facilitating editing of the FR hairpin. Further, the multifunctional paraspeckle protein, NONO, was found to bind to oriPt transcripts, suggesting that oriPts interact with the paraspeckle-based innate antiviral immune pathway. Knockdown and ectopic expression of oriPtLs showed that it contributes to global viral lytic gene expression and viral DNA replication. Together, these results show that these new vlncRNAs interact with cellular innate immune pathways and that they help facilitate progression of the viral lytic cascade. IMPORTANCE: Recent studies have revealed that the complexity of lytic herpesviral transcriptomes is significantly greater than previously appreciated with hundreds of viral long noncoding RNAs (vlncRNAs) being recently discovered. Work on cellular lncRNAs over the past several years has just begun to give us an initial appreciation for the array of functions they play in complex formation and regulatory processes in the cell. The newly identified herpesvirus lncRNAs are similarly likely to play a variety of different functions, although these functions are likely tailored to specific needs of the viral infection cycles. Here we describe novel transcripts derived from the EBV latency origin of replication. We show that they are hyperedited, that they interact with a relatively newly appreciated antiviral pathway, and that they play a role in facilitating viral lytic gene expression. These investigations are a starting point to unraveling the complex arena of vlncRNA function in herpesvirus lytic replication.",2015 Jul,J Virol. 2015 Jul;89(14):7120-32. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00608-15.

25555396,Dynamic response of RNA editing to temperature in Drosophila.,"BACKGROUND: Adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing is a highly conserved process that post-transcriptionally modifies mRNA, generating proteomic diversity, particularly within the nervous system of metazoans. Transcripts encoding proteins involved in neurotransmission predominate as targets of such modifications. Previous reports suggest that RNA editing is responsive to environmental inputs in the form of temperature alterations. However, the molecular determinants underlying temperature-dependent RNA editing responses are not well understood. RESULTS: Using the poikilotherm Drosophila, we show that acute temperature alterations within a normal physiological range result in substantial changes in RNA editing levels. Our examination of particular sites reveals diversity in the patterns with which editing responds to temperature, and these patterns are conserved across five species of Drosophilidae representing over 10 million years of divergence. In addition, we show that expression of the editing enzyme, ADAR (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA), is dramatically decreased at elevated temperatures, partially, but not fully, explaining some target responses to temperature. Interestingly, this reduction in editing enzyme levels at elevated temperature is only partially reversed by a return to lower temperatures. Lastly, we show that engineered structural variants of the most temperature-sensitive editing site, in a sodium channel transcript, perturb thermal responsiveness in RNA editing profile for a particular RNA structure. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the RNA editing process responds to temperature alterations via two distinct molecular mechanisms: through intrinsic thermo-sensitivity of the RNA structures that direct editing, and due to temperature sensitive expression or stability of the RNA editing enzyme. Environmental cues, in this case temperature, rapidly reprogram the Drosophila transcriptome through RNA editing, presumably resulting in altered proteomic ratios of edited and unedited proteins.",2015 Jan 3,BMC Biol. 2015 Jan 3;13:1. doi: 10.1186/s12915-014-0111-3.,"['Rieder LE', 'Savva YA', 'Reyna MA', 'Chang YJ', 'Dorsky JS', 'Rezaei A', 'Reenan RA']",True
25630791,The origin of the ADAR gene family and animal RNA editing.,"BACKGROUND: ADAR (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA) proteins convert adenosine into inosine in double-stranded RNAs and have been shown to increase gene product diversity in a number of bilaterians, particularly mammals and flies. This enzyme family appears to have evolved from an ADAT (adenosine deaminase acting on tRNA) ancestor, via the addition of a double-stranded RNA binding domain. The modern vertebrate ADAR family is comprised of ADAD, ADAR2 and ADAR1, each of which has a conserved domain architecture. To reconstruct the origin of this protein family, we identified and categorised ADAR family members encoded in the genomes and/or transcriptomes of early-branching metazoan and closely related non-metazoan taxa, including thirteen sponge and ten ctenophore species. RESULTS: We demonstrate that the ADAR protein family is a metazoan innovation, with the three ADAR subtypes being present in representatives of the earliest phyletic lineages of animals - sponges and ctenophores - but not in other closely related choanoflagellate and filasterean holozoans. ADAR1 is missing from all ctenophore genomes and transcriptomes surveyed. Depending on the relationship of sponges and ctenophores to the rest of the Metazoa, this is consistent with either ADAR1 being lost in ctenophores, as it has been in multiple metazoan lineages, or being an innovation that evolved after ctenophores diverged from the rest of the animal kingdom. The presence of Z-DNA binding domains in some sponge ADARs indicates an ancestral ADAR included this domain and it has been lost in multiple animal lineages. CONCLUSIONS: The ADAR family appears to be a metazoan innovation, with all family members in place in the earliest phyletic branches of the crown Metazoa. The presence of ADARs in sponges and ctenophores is consistent with A-to-I editing being a post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism that was used by the last common ancestor to all living animals and subsequently has been preserved in most modern lineages.",2015 Jan 29,BMC Evol Biol. 2015 Jan 29;15(1):4. doi: 10.1186/s12862-015-0279-3.,"['Grice LF', 'Degnan BM']",False
25618141,Highly constrained intergenic Drosophila ultraconserved elements are candidate ncRNAs.,"Eukaryotes contain short (∼80-200 bp) regions that have few or no substitutions among species that represent hundreds of millions of years of evolutionary divergence. These ultraconserved elements (UCEs) are candidates for containing essential functions, but their biological roles remain largely unknown. Here, we report the discovery and characterization of UCEs from 12 sequenced Drosophila species. We identified 98 elements ≥80 bp long with very high conservation across the Drosophila phylogeny. Population genetic analyses reveal that these UCEs are not present in mutational cold spots. Instead we infer that they experience a level of selective constraint almost 10-fold higher compared with missense mutations in protein-coding sequences, which is substantially higher than that observed previously for human UCEs. About one-half of these Drosophila UCEs overlap the transcribed portion of genes, with many of those that are within coding sequences likely to correspond to sites of ADAR-dependent RNA editing. For the remaining UCEs that are in nongenic regions, we find that many are potentially capable of forming RNA secondary structures. Among ten chosen for further analysis, we discovered that the majority are transcribed in multiple tissues of Drosophila melanogaster. We conclude that Drosophila species are rich with UCEs and that many of them may correspond to novel noncoding RNAs.",2015 Jan 23,Genome Biol Evol. 2015 Jan 23;7(3):689-98. doi: 10.1093/gbe/evv011.,"['Kern AD', 'Barbash DA', 'Chang Mell J', 'Hupalo D', 'Jensen A']",False

To investigate possible circRNA functions, it is important to understand circRNA biogenesis. Besides human ALU repeats, sequence features that promote exon circularization are largely unknown. We experimentally identified circRNAs in C. elegans. Reverse complementary sequences between introns bracketing circRNAs were significantly enriched in comparison to linear controls. By scoring the presence of reverse complementary sequences in human introns, we predicted and experimentally validated circRNAs. We show that introns bracketing circRNAs are highly enriched in RNA editing or hyperediting events. Knockdown of the double-strand RNA-editing enzyme ADAR1 significantly and specifically upregulated circRNA expression. Together, our data support a model of animal circRNA biogenesis in which competing RNA-RNA interactions of introns form larger structures that promote circularization of embedded exons, whereas ADAR1 antagonizes circRNA expression by melting stems within these interactions.",2015 Jan 13,Cell Rep. 2015 Jan 13;10(2):170-7. doi: 10.1016/j.celrep.2014.12.019.

25582055,"Modulation of microRNA editing, expression and processing by ADAR2 deaminase in glioblastoma.","BACKGROUND: ADAR enzymes convert adenosines to inosines within double-stranded RNAs, including microRNA (miRNA) precursors, with important consequences on miRNA retargeting and expression. ADAR2 activity is impaired in glioblastoma and its rescue has anti-tumoral effects. However, how ADAR2 activity may impact the miRNome and the progression of glioblastoma is not known. RESULTS: By integrating deep-sequencing and array approaches with bioinformatics analyses and molecular studies, we show that ADAR2 is essential to edit a small number of mature miRNAs and to significantly modulate the expression of about 90 miRNAs in glioblastoma cells. Specifically, the rescue of ADAR2 activity in cancer cells recovers the edited miRNA population lost in glioblastoma cell lines and tissues, and rebalances expression of onco-miRNAs and tumor suppressor miRNAs to the levels observed in normal human brain. We report that the major effect of ADAR2 is to reduce the expression of a large number of miRNAs, most of which act as onco-miRNAs. ADAR2 can edit miR-222/221 and miR-21 precursors and decrease the expression of the corresponding mature onco-miRNAs in vivo and in vitro, with important effects on cell proliferation and migration.

25373143,Profiling the RNA editomes of wild-type C. elegans and ADAR mutants.,"RNA editing increases transcriptome diversity through post-transcriptional modifications of RNA. Adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADARs) catalyze the adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) conversion, the most common type of RNA editing in higher eukaryotes. Caenorhabditis elegans has two ADARs, ADR-1 and ADR-2, but their functions remain unclear. Here, we profiled the RNA editomes of C. elegans at different developmental stages of wild-type and ADAR mutants. We developed a new computational pipeline with a ""bisulfite-seq-mapping-like"" step and achieved a threefold increase in identification sensitivity. A total of 99.5% of the 47,660 A-to-I editing sites were found in clusters. Of the 3080 editing clusters, 65.7% overlapped with DNA transposons in noncoding regions and 73.7% could form hairpin structures. The numbers of editing sites and clusters were highest at the L1 and embryonic stages. The editing frequency of a cluster positively correlated with the number of editing sites within it. Intriguingly, for 80% of the clusters with 10 or more editing sites, almost all expressed transcripts were edited. Deletion of adr-1 reduced the editing frequency but not the number of editing clusters, whereas deletion of adr-2 nearly abolished RNA editing, indicating a modulating role of ADR-1 and an essential role of ADR-2 in A-to-I editing. Quantitative proteomics analysis showed that adr-2 mutant worms altered the abundance of proteins involved in aging and lifespan regulation. Consistent with this finding, we observed that worms lacking RNA editing were short-lived. Taken together, our results reveal a sophisticated landscape of RNA editing and distinct modes of action of different ADARs.",2015 Jan,Genome Res. 2015 Jan;25(1):66-75. doi: 10.1101/gr.176107.114.

25446799,"The effects of taurine on vigabatrin, high light intensity and mydriasis induced retinal toxicity in the pigmented rat.","The overall purpose of this study was to establish a model that may be used for examining the effect of Vigabatrin-induced retinal toxicity in pigmented rats, and subsequently examine the possible effects of taurine on the retinal toxicity. In the first part of the study, pigmented Long Evans rats were subjected to combinations of induced mydriasis, low/high light intensities (40/2000 lx) and oral administration of near-MTD (Maximum Tolerated Dose) doses (200 mg/kg/day) of Vigabatrin for up to 6 weeks. The combination of mydriasis and high light intensity applied to Long Evans rats resulted in retinal damage that was increased by the administration of Vigabatrin. In the second part of the study Long Evans rats were subjected to combinations of induced mydriasis and high/low light intensity (40/2000 lx) while being orally administered low (30 mg/kg/day) or high (200 mg/kg/day) doses of Vigabatrin for up to 6 weeks. In addition, selected groups of animals were administered taurine via the drinking water (20 mg/ml), resulting in systemic taurine concentrations of approximately threefold the endogenous concentration. The combined results of the studies demonstrate that retinal damage can be induced in pigmented animals when combining mydriasis and high light intensity. Retinal damage was functionally evaluated by electroretinography (ERG), then confirmed by histopathology. While depending on mydriasis and high light intensity, administration of Vigabatrin increased the retinal toxicity and resulted in the formation of rosette-like structures in the retina in a dose-related manner. Administration of taurine did not alleviate the Vigabatrin-induced retinal toxicity, as demonstrated either functionally by ERG or morphologically, although systemic concentrations of 3-fold the endogenous levels were reached, and it was thus not possible to demonstrate a protective effect of taurine in these pigmented animals.",2015 Jan,Exp Toxicol Pathol. 2015 Jan;67(1):13-20. doi: 10.1016/j.etp.2014.09.004.

25554247,"Vigabatrin-induced CNS changes in juvenile rats: Induction, progression and recovery of myelin-related changes.","The purpose of this study was to expand on the knowledge previously published on the central nervous system effects of Vigabatrin in juvenile animals. By employing extended sectioning of the brain and by using four different tissue staining techniques it is demonstrated that oral administration of Vigabatrin to juvenile rats (treatment periods of post-natal day (PND) 4-7, 7-14 or 14-30) will cause histological CNS changes at dose levels of 15 and 50mg/kg/day, but not at a dose level of 5mg/kg/day. No evidence of neuronal degeneration or gliosis was seen at any stage of treatment. Consistent with previous reports microvacuolation, as well as effects on myelination and on oligodendrocytes were recorded. The present study expands on these findings and demonstrates that the variation in the location of the vigabatrin-induced lesions in the juvenile rat brain (both neuropil vacuolation and reduction of myelin) appears to be consistent with the process of myelination: In the youngest animals (PND 4-7) myelination occurs mainly in the hind brain (medulla oblongata and pons) where neuropil vacuolations is recorded. In animals dosed during PNDs 7-14 or during PNDs 14-30, the first changes were found in the thalamus. It seems likely that the earlier stages of myelination are more vulnerable to treatment related effects and the swollen oligodendrocytes seen as the initial change in the thalamus in animals treated during PNDs 4-7 and 7-14 represents an early stage in the development of the myelin lesion which is seen later as neuropil vacuolation.",2015 Jan,Neurotoxicology. 2015 Jan;46:137-44. doi: 10.1016/j.neuro.2014.12.008.

However, our understanding of reaction selectivity is limited. ADARs are modular enzymes with multiple double-stranded RNA binding domains (dsRBDs) and a catalytic domain. While dsRBD binding is understood, little is known about ADAR catalytic domain/RNA interactions. Here we use a recently discovered RNA substrate that is rapidly deaminated by the isolated human ADAR2 deaminase domain (hADAR2-D) to probe these interactions. We introduced the nucleoside analog 8-azanebularine (8-azaN) into this RNA (and derived constructs) to mechanistically trap the protein-RNA complex without catalytic turnover for EMSA and ribonuclease footprinting analyses. EMSA showed that hADAR2-D requires duplex RNA and is sensitive to 2'-deoxy substitution at nucleotides opposite the editing site, the local sequence and 8-azaN nucleotide positioning on the duplex. Ribonuclease V1 footprinting shows that hADAR2-D protects ∼ 23 nt on the edited strand around the editing site in an asymmetric fashion (∼ 18 nt on the 5' side and ∼ 5 nt on the 3' side). These studies provide a deeper understanding of the ADAR catalytic domain-RNA interaction and new tools for biophysical analysis of ADAR-RNA complexes.",2015 Jan,Nucleic Acids Res. 2015 Jan;43(2):1123-32. doi: 10.1093/nar/gku1345.

25889244,An RNA editing fingerprint of cancer stem cell reprogramming.,"BACKGROUND: Deregulation of RNA editing by adenosine deaminases acting on dsRNA (ADARs) has been implicated in the progression of diverse human cancers including hematopoietic malignancies such as chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Inflammation-associated activation of ADAR1 occurs in leukemia stem cells specifically in the advanced, often drug-resistant stage of CML known as blast crisis. However, detection of cancer stem cell-associated RNA editing by RNA sequencing in these rare cell populations can be technically challenging, costly and requires PCR validation. The objectives of this study were to validate RNA editing of a subset of cancer stem cell-associated transcripts, and to develop a quantitative RNA editing fingerprint assay for rapid detection of aberrant RNA editing in human malignancies. METHODS: To facilitate quantification of cancer stem cell-associated RNA editing in exons and intronic or 3'UTR primate-specific Alu sequences using a sensitive, cost-effective method, we established an in vitro RNA editing model and developed a sensitive RNA editing fingerprint assay that employs a site-specific quantitative PCR (RESSq-PCR) strategy. This assay was validated in a stably-transduced human leukemia cell line, lentiviral-ADAR1 transduced primary hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, and in primary human chronic myeloid leukemia stem cells. RESULTS: In lentiviral ADAR1-expressing cells, increased RNA editing of MDM2, APOBEC3D, GLI1 and AZIN1 transcripts was detected by RESSq-PCR with improved sensitivity over sequencing chromatogram analysis. This method accurately detected cancer stem cell-associated RNA editing in primary chronic myeloid leukemia samples, establishing a cancer stem cell-specific RNA editing fingerprint of leukemic transformation that will support clinical development of novel diagnostic tools to predict and prevent cancer progression. CONCLUSIONS: RNA editing quantification enables rapid detection of malignant progenitors signifying cancer progression and therapeutic resistance, and will aid future RNA editing inhibitor development efforts.",2015 Feb 12,J Transl Med. 2015 Feb 12;13:52. doi: 10.1186/s12967-014-0370-3.,"['Crews LA', 'Jiang Q', 'Zipeto MA', 'Lazzari E', 'Court AC', 'Ali S', 'Barrett CL', 'Frazer KA', 'Jamieson CH']",True

ADAR1 may exhibit antiviral or proviral activity depending on the type of virus. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 is the most well-studied lentivirus with respect to its interaction with ADAR1, and variable results have been reported. In this study, we demonstrated that equine ADAR1 (eADAR1) was a positive regulator of equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV), another lentivirus of the Retroviridae family. First, eADAR1 significantly promoted EIAV replication, and the enhancement of viral protein expression was associated with the long terminal repeat (LTR) and Rev response element (RRE) regions. Second, the RNA binding domain 1 of eADAR1 was essential only for enhancing LTR-mediated gene expression. Third, in contrast with APOBEC proteins, which have been shown to reduce lentiviral infectivity, eADAR1 increased the EIAV infectivity. This study indicated that eADAR1 was proviral rather than antiviral for EIAV.",2015 Feb,Virology. 2015 Feb;476:364-371. doi: 10.1016/j.virol.2014.12.038.

A direct consequence of this feature is that primates' transcriptome is highly enriched in long stable dsRNA structures, the preferred target of adenosine deaminases acting on RNAs (ADARs), which are the enzymes catalyzing A-to-I RNA editing. Indeed, A-to-I editing by ADARs is extremely abundant in primates: over a hundred million editing sites exist in their genomes. However, there are few essential editing sites conserved across mammals that have maintained their editing level despite the radical change in ADAR target landscape. Here, we review and discuss the cost of having an unusual amount of dsRNA and editing in the transcriptome, as well as the opportunities it presents, which might have contributed to the accelerated evolution of the primates.",2015 Feb,Bioessays. 2015 Feb;37(2):175-81. doi: 10.1002/bies.201400163.

Although the RNA targets of ADAR-mediated editing have been extensively cataloged, our understanding of the cellular function of such editing remains incomplete. We report that long, double-stranded RNA added to Xenopus laevis egg extract is incorporated into an ADAR-containing complex whose protein components resemble those of stress granules. This complex localizes to microtubules, as assayed by accumulation on meiotic spindles. We observe that the length of a double-stranded RNA influences its incorporation into the microtubule-localized complex. ADAR forms a similar complex with endogenous RNA, but the endogenous complex fails to localize to microtubules. In addition, we characterize the endogenous, ADAR-associated RNAs and discover that they are enriched for transcripts encoding transcriptional regulators, zinc-finger proteins, and components of the secretory pathway. Interestingly, association with ADAR correlates with previously reported translational repression in early embryonic development. This work demonstrates that ADAR is a component of two, distinct ribonucleoprotein complexes that contain different types of RNAs and exhibit diverse cellular localization patterns.

We report on 374 patients from 299 families with mutations in these seven genes. Most patients conformed to one of two fairly stereotyped clinical profiles; either exhibiting an in utero disease-onset (74 patients; 22.8% of all patients where data were available), or a post-natal presentation, usually within the first year of life (223 patients; 68.6%), characterized by a sub-acute encephalopathy and a loss of previously acquired skills. Other clinically distinct phenotypes were also observed; particularly, bilateral striatal necrosis (13 patients; 3.6%) and non-syndromic spastic paraparesis (12 patients; 3.4%). We recorded 69 deaths (19.3% of patients with follow-up data). Of 285 patients for whom data were available, 210 (73.7%) were profoundly disabled, with no useful motor, speech and intellectual function. Chilblains, glaucoma, hypothyroidism, cardiomyopathy, intracerebral vasculitis, peripheral neuropathy, bowel inflammation and systemic lupus erythematosus were seen frequently enough to be confirmed as real associations with the Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome phenotype. We observed a robust relationship between mutations in all seven genes with increased type I interferon activity in cerebrospinal fluid and serum, and the increased expression of interferon-stimulated gene transcripts in peripheral blood. We recorded a positive correlation between the level of cerebrospinal fluid interferon activity assayed within one year of disease presentation and the degree of subsequent disability. Interferon-stimulated gene transcripts remained high in most patients, indicating an ongoing disease process. On the basis of substantial morbidity and mortality, our data highlight the urgent need to define coherent treatment strategies for the phenotypes associated with mutations in the Aicardi-Goutières syndrome-related genes.

ADAR1 loss is embryonically lethal because of severe liver damage. Although ADAR1 is required in adult livers to prevent liver cell death, as demonstrated by liver-specific conditional knockout (Alb-ADAR1(KO)) mice, the mechanism remains elusive. We systematically analyzed Alb-ADAR1(KO) mice for liver damage. Differentiation genes and inflammatory pathways were examined in hepatic tissues from Alb-ADAR1(KO) and littermate controls. Inducible ADAR1 KO mice were used to validate regulatory effects of ADAR1 on inflammatory cytokines. We found that Alb-ADAR1(KO) mice showed dramatic growth retardation and high mortality because of severe structural and functional damage to the liver, which showed overwhelming inflammation, cell death, fibrosis, fatty change, and compensatory regeneration. Simultaneously, Alb-ADAR1(KO) showed altered expression of key differentiation genes and significantly higher levels of hepatic inflammatory cytokines, especially type I interferons, which was also verified by inducible ADAR1 knockdown in primary hepatocyte cultures. We conclude that ADAR1 is an essential molecule for maintaining adult liver homeostasis and, in turn, morphological and functional integrity.

The cause for this X-linked disorder is the silencing of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (fmr1) gene and the absence of the fragile X mental retardation protein (Fmrp). The RNA-binding protein Fmrp represses protein translation, particularly in synapses. In Drosophila, Fmrp interacts with the adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (Adar) enzymes. Adar enzymes convert adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) and modify the sequence of RNA transcripts. Utilizing the fmr1 zebrafish mutant (fmr1-/-), we studied Fmrp-dependent neuronal circuit formation, behavior, and Adar-mediated RNA editing. By combining behavior analyses and live imaging of single axons and synapses, we showed hyperlocomotor activity, as well as increased axonal branching and synaptic density, in fmr1-/- larvae. We identified thousands of clustered RNA editing sites in the zebrafish transcriptome and showed that Fmrp biochemically interacts with the Adar2a protein.

26658668,The Epitranscriptome and Innate Immunity.,"Our knowledge of the variety and abundances of RNA base modifications is rapidly increasing. Modified bases have critical roles in tRNAs, rRNAs, translation, splicing, RNA interference, and other RNA processes, and are now increasingly detected in all types of transcripts. Can new biological principles associated with this diversity of RNA modifications, particularly in mRNAs and long non-coding RNAs, be identified? This review will explore this question by focusing primarily on adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing by the adenine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) enzymes that have been intensively studied for the past 20 years and have a wide range of effects. Over 100 million adenosine to inosine editing sites have been identified in the human transcriptome, mostly in embedded Alu sequences that form potentially innate immune-stimulating dsRNA hairpins in transcripts. Recent research has demonstrated that inosine in the epitranscriptome and ADAR1 protein establish innate immune tolerance for host dsRNA formed by endogenous sequences. Innate immune sensors that detect viral nucleic acids are among the readers of epitranscriptome RNA modifications, though this does preclude a wide range of other modification effects.",2015 Dec,PLoS Genet. 2015 Dec 10;11(12):e1005687. doi: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1005687. eCollection 2015 Dec.,"[""O'Connell MA"", 'Mannion NM', 'Keegan LP']",True
26674414,RNA editing of microRNA prevents RNA-induced silencing complex recognition of target mRNA.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) integrate with Argonaut (Ago) to create the RNA-induced silencing complex, and regulate gene expression by silencing target mRNAs. RNA editing of miRNA may affect miRNA processing, assembly of the Ago complex and target mRNA binding. However, the function of edited miRNA, assembled within the Ago complex, has not been extensively investigated. In this study, sequence analysis of the Ago complex of Marsupenaeus japonicus shrimp infected with white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) revealed that host ADAR (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA) catalysed A-to-I RNA editing of a viral miRNA (WSSV-miR-N12) at the +16 site. This editing of the non-seed sequence did not affect association of the edited miRNA with the Ago protein, but inhibited interaction between the miRNA and its target gene (wsv399). The WSSV early gene wsv399 inhibited WSSV infection. As a result, the RNA editing of miRNA caused virus latency. Our results highlight a novel example of miRNA editing in the miRNA-induced silencing complex.",2015 Dec,Open Biol. 2015 Dec;5(12):150126. doi: 10.1098/rsob.150126.,"['Cui Y', 'Huang T', 'Zhang X']",True

25851944,Cell type-specific in vivo expression of genes encoding signalling molecules in the brain in response to chronic mild stress and chronic treatment with fluoxetine.,"RATIONALE: Previously, we reported that chronic treatment with fluoxetine increased gene expression of 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2B (5-HT2BR), cytosolic phospholipase 2α (cPLA2α), glutamate receptor, ionotropic kainate 2 (GluK2) and adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 2 (ADAR2), in cultured astrocytes and astrocytes freshly isolated from transgenic mice tagged with an astrocyte-specific marker. In contrast, neurones isolated from transgenic mice tagged with a neurone-specific marker and exposed to fluoxetine showed an increase in gene expression of glutamate receptor, ionotropic kainate 4 (GluK4) and 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2C (5-HT2CR). In a mouse model of anhedonia, the downregulation of 5-HT2BR, cPLA2α, ADAR2 and GluK4 but not GluK2 and 5-HT2CR was detected. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of chronic mild stress (CMS) and/or fluoxetine treatment on gene expression of 5-HT2BR, 5-HT2CR, cPLA2α, ADAR2, GluK2 and GluK4 specifically in astrocytes and neurones. METHODS: Transgenic mice tagged with either astrocyte- or neurone-specific markers were exposed to the CMS. Real-time PCR was applied to determine expression of messenger RNA (mRNA). RESULTS: We found that (i) mRNAs of the 5-HT2BR and cPLA2α in astrocytes and GluK4 in neurones were significantly reduced in mice that became anhedonic; the mRNA levels were restored by fluoxetine treatment; (ii) ADAR2 in astrocytes was decreased by the CMS but showed no response to fluoxetine in anhedonic animals; (iii) neither GluK2 expression in astrocytes nor 5-HT2CR expression in neurones were affected in anhedonic animals, although expression of 5-HT2CR mRNA was upregulated by fluoxetine. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the effects of chronic treatment with fluoxetine are not only dependent on the cell type studied but also on the development of anhedonia.

25972541,Measles Virus Defective Interfering RNAs Are Generated Frequently and Early in the Absence of C Protein and Can Be Destabilized by Adenosine Deaminase Acting on RNA-1-Like Hypermutations.,"Defective interfering RNAs (DI-RNAs) of the viral genome can form during infections of negative-strand RNA viruses and outgrow full-length viral genomes, thereby modulating the severity and duration of infection. Here we document the frequent de novo generation of copy-back DI-RNAs from independent rescue events both for a vaccine measles virus (vac2) and for a wild-type measles virus (IC323) as early as passage 1 after virus rescue. Moreover, vaccine and wild-type C-protein-deficient (C-protein-knockout [CKO]) measles viruses generated about 10 times more DI-RNAs than parental virus, suggesting that C enhances the processivity of the viral polymerase. We obtained the nucleotide sequences of 65 individual DI-RNAs, identified breakpoints and reinitiation sites, and predicted their structural features. Several DI-RNAs possessed clusters of A-to-G or U-to-C transitions. Sequences flanking these mutation sites were characteristic of those favored by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA-1 (ADAR1), which catalyzes in double-stranded RNA the C-6 deamination of adenosine to produce inosine, which is recognized as guanosine, a process known as A-to-I RNA editing. In individual DI-RNAs the transitions were of the same type and occurred on both sides of the breakpoint. These patterns of mutations suggest that ADAR1 edits unencapsidated DI-RNAs that form double-strand RNA structures. Encapsidated DI-RNAs were incorporated into virus particles, which reduced the infectivity of virus stocks. The CKO phenotype was dominant: DI-RNAs derived from vac2 with a CKO suppressed the replication of vac2, as shown by coinfections of interferon-incompetent lymphatic cells with viruses expressing different fluorescent reporter proteins. In contrast, coinfection with a C-protein-expressing virus did not counteract the suppressive phenotype of DI-RNAs. IMPORTANCE: Recombinant measles viruses (MVs) are in clinical trials as cancer therapeutics and as vectored vaccines for HIV-AIDS and other infectious diseases. The efficacy of MV-based vectors depends on their replication proficiency and immune activation capacity. Here we document that copy-back defective interfering RNAs (DI-RNAs) are generated by recombinant vaccine and wild-type MVs immediately after rescue. The MV C protein interferes with DI-RNA generation and may enhance the processivity of the viral polymerase. We frequently detected clusters of A-to-G or U-to-C transitions and noted that sequences flanking individual mutations contain motifs favoring recognition by the adenosine deaminase acting on RNA-1 (ADAR1). The consistent type of transitions on the DI-RNAs indicates that these are direct substrates for editing by ADAR1. The ADAR1-mediated biased hypermutation events are consistent with the protein kinase R (PKR)-ADAR1 balancing model of innate immunity activation. We show by coinfection that the C-defective phenotype is dominant.",2015 Aug,J Virol. 2015 Aug;89(15):7735-47. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01017-15.

However, ADAR1 knockdown (KD) did not alter cell morphology, alkaline phosphatase (AP) staining activities and the expression levels of pluripotent marker genes, indicating that ADAR1 is dispensable for maintenance of pluripotency. Furthermore, ADAR1-KD iPS cells did not change proliferation rate. These findings extended the role of ADAR1 and might open the road for understanding pluripotent state more deeply.",2015 Aug,Genes Cells. 2015 Aug;20(8):675-80. doi: 10.1111/gtc.12261.

Mutations in those genes affect normal RNA/DNA intracellular metabolism and detection, triggering an autoimmune response with an increase in cerebral IFN-α production by astrocytes. Microangiopathy and vascular disease also contribute to the neuropathology in AGS. In this study, we report that AGS gene silencing of TREX1, SAMHD1, RNASEH2A, and ADAR1 by short hairpin RNAs in human neural stem cell-derived astrocytes, human primary astrocytes, and brain-derived endothelial cells leads to an antiviral status of these cells compared with nontarget short hairpin RNA-treated cells. We observed a distinct activation of the IFN-stimulated gene signature with a substantial increase in the release of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6) and chemokines (CXCL10 and CCL5). A differential impact of AGS gene silencing was noted; silencing TREX1 gave rise to the most dramatic in both cell types. Our findings fit well with the observation that patients carrying mutations in TREX1 experience an earlier onset and fatal outcome. We provide in the present study, to our knowledge for the first time, insight into how astrocytic and endothelial activation of antiviral status may differentially lead to cerebral pathology, suggesting a rational link between proinflammatory mediators and disease severity in AGS.",2015 Apr 15,J Immunol. 2015 Apr 15;194(8):3623-33. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1401334.

Here we observed that ADAR1 deficiency in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) significantly affected hESC differentiation and neural induction with widespread changes in mRNA and miRNA expression, including upregulation of self-renewal-related miRNAs, such as miR302s. Global editing analyses revealed that ADAR1 editing activity contributes little to the altered miRNA/mRNA expression in ADAR1-deficient hESCs upon neural induction. Genome-wide iCLIP studies identified that ADAR1 binds directly to pri-miRNAs to interfere with miRNA processing by acting as an RNA-binding protein. Importantly, aberrant expression of miRNAs and phenotypes observed in ADAR1-depleted hESCs upon neural differentiation could be reversed by an enzymatically inactive ADAR1 mutant, but not by the RNA-binding-null ADAR1 mutant. These findings reveal that ADAR1, but not its editing activity, is critical for hESC differentiation and neural induction by regulating miRNA biogenesis via direct RNA interaction.",2015 Apr,Cell Res. 2015 Apr;25(4):459-76. doi: 10.1038/cr.2015.24.

25722083,DNA and RNA editing of retrotransposons accelerate mammalian genome evolution.,"Genome evolution is commonly viewed as a gradual process that is driven by random mutations that accumulate over time. However, DNA- and RNA-editing enzymes have been identified that can accelerate evolution by actively modifying the genomically encoded information. The apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzymes, catalytic polypeptide-like (APOBECs) are potent restriction factors that can inhibit retroelements by cytosine-to-uridine editing of retroelement DNA after reverse transcription. In some cases, a retroelement may successfully integrate into the genome despite being hypermutated. Such events introduce unique sequences into the genome and are thus a source of genomic innovation. adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADARs) catalyze adenosine-to-inosine editing in double-stranded RNA, commonly formed by oppositely oriented retroelements. The RNA editing confers plasticity to the transcriptome by generating many transcript variants from a single genomic locus. If the editing produces a beneficial variant, the genome may maintain the locus that produces the RNA-edited transcript for its novel function. Here, we discuss how these two powerful editing mechanisms, which both target inserted retroelements, facilitate expedited genome evolution.",2015 Apr,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2015 Apr;1341:115-25. doi: 10.1111/nyas.12713.

25798088,GluA2 is rapidly edited at the Q/R site during neural differentiation in vitro.,"The majority of AMPA receptors in the adult brain contain GluA2 subunits, which can be edited at the Q/R site, changing a glutamine to an arginine within the ion pore. Q/R editing renders AMPARs virtually Ca(2+)-impermeable, which is important for normal AMPA receptor function. Thus, all GluA2 subunits are Q/R-edited in the adult brain. However, it has remained controversial precisely when editing sets in during development. In the present study, we show that GluA2 mRNA is very rapidly Q/R-edited immediately after its appearance, which is after 4.5 days of differentiation from 46C embryonic stem cells (ESCs) to neuroepithelial precursor cells (NEPs). At this time point, most of the GluA2 transcripts were already edited, with only a small fraction remaining unedited, and half a day later all GluA2 transcripts were edited. This can be explained by the observation that the enzyme that Q/R-edits GluA2 transcripts, ADAR2, is already expressed in the cell well before GluA2 transcription starts, and later is not significantly upregulated any more. Editing at another site works differently: The R/G site within the ligand-binding domain was never completely edited at any of the developmental stages tested, and the enzyme that performs this editing, ADAR1, was significantly upregulated during neural differentiation. This confirms previous data suggesting that R/G editing, in contrast to Q/R editing, progresses gradually during development.",2015,Front Cell Neurosci. 2015 Mar 5;9:69. doi: 10.3389/fncel.2015.00069. eCollection 2015.,"['Pachernegg S', 'Münster Y', 'Muth-Köhne E', 'Fuhrmann G', 'Hollmann M']",False

However, a few cases of vaccine virulence reversion have been documented in several countries. For instance, circulating type 1 vaccine-derived poliovirus is a highly pathogenic poliovirus that evolved from an avirulent strain, but the mechanism by which vaccine strains undergo reversion remains unclear. In this study, vaccine strains exhibited A to G/U to C and G to A/C to U hypermutations in the reversed evolution of Sabin 1. Furthermore, the mutation ratios of U to C and C to U were higher than those of other mutation types. Dinucleotide editing context was then analyzed. Results showed that A to G and U to C mutations exhibited preferences similar to adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADAR).

These modifications can appear either as hyperediting during persistent viral infections or as specific RNA editing events in viral dsRNAs. It is now well established that ADAR enzymes can affect viruses and viral interaction with the host cell in both an editing-dependent and -independent manner, with ADARs acting as pro- or anti-viral factors. Despite the discovery of editing events on viral RNAs dates back to thirty years ago, the biological consequences of A-to-I changes during viral infection is still far to be completely elucidated.

In neurons, editing of ionotropic AMPA glutamate receptors has been shown to be altered under several experimental conditions, including severe pathologies, thus highlighting the potential significance of its modulation. In this study, we treated rat primary cortical cell cultures with a sub-lethal dose of glutamate (10 μM), focusing on RNA editing and ADAR activity. We found that chronic glutamate treatment down-regulates RNA editing levels at the R/G site of GluA2-4 subunits of AMPA receptors and at the K/E site of CYFIP2. These changes are site-specific since they were not observed either for the GluA2 Q/R site or for other non-glutamatergic sites. Glutamate treatment also down-regulates the protein expression levels of both ADAR1 and ADAR2 enzymes, through a pathway that is Ca(2+)- and calpain-dependent. Given that AMPA receptors containing unedited subunits show a slower recovery rate from desensitization compared to those containing edited forms, the reduced editing at the R/G site may, at least in part, compensate for glutamate over-stimulation, perhaps through the reduced activation of postsynaptic receptors. In summary, our data provide direct evidence of the involvement of ADAR1 and ADAR2 activity as a possible compensatory mechanism for neuronal protection following glutamate over-stimulation.",2015,RNA Biol. 2015;12(1):43-53. doi: 10.1080/15476286.2015.1008365.,"['Bonini D', 'Filippini A', 'La Via L', 'Fiorentini C', 'Fumagalli F', 'Colombi M', 'Barbon A']",True
25759810,Knowledge in the Investigation of A-to-I RNA Editing Signals.,"RNA editing is a post-transcriptional alteration of RNA sequences that is able to affect protein structure as well as RNA and protein expression. Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing is the most frequent and common post-transcriptional modification in human, where adenosine (A) deamination produces its conversion into inosine (I), which in turn is interpreted by the translation and splicing machineries as guanosine (G). The disruption of the editing machinery has been associated to various human diseases such as cancer or neurodegenerative diseases. This biological phenomenon is catalyzed by members of the adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) family of enzymes and occurs on dsRNA structures. Despite the enormous efforts made in the last decade, the real biological function underlying such a phenomenon, as well as ADAR's substrate features still remain unknown. In this work, we summarize the major computational aspects of predicting and understanding RNA editing events. We also investigate the detection of short motif sequences potentially characterizing RNA editing signals and the use of a logistic regression technique to model a predictor of RNA editing events. The latter, named AIRlINER, an algorithmic approach to assessment of A-to-I RNA editing sites in non-repetitive regions, is available as a web app at: http://alpha.dmi.unict.it/airliner/.

25806564,Flow-cytometric visualization of C>U mRNA editing reveals the dynamics of the process in live cells.,"APOBEC1 is the catalytic subunit of the complex that edits ApolipoproteinB (ApoB) mRNA, which specifically deaminates cytidine 6666 to uracil in the human transcript. The editing leads to the generation of a stop codon, resulting in the synthesis of a truncated form of ApoB. We have developed a method to quantitatively assay ApoB RNA editing in live cells by using a double fluorescent mCherry-EGFP chimera containing a ∼ 300 bp fragment encompassing the region of ApoB subject to RNA editing. Coexpression of APOBEC1 together with this chimera causes specific RNA editing of the ApoB fragment. The insertion of a stop codon between the mCherry and EGFP thus induces the loss of EGFP fluorescence. Using this method we analyze the dynamics of APOBEC1-dependent RNA editing under various conditions. Namely we show the interplay of APOBEC1 with known interactors (ACF, hnRNP-C1, GRY-RBP) in cells that are RNA editing-proficient (HuH-7) or -deficient (HEK-293T), and the effects of restricted cellular localization of APOBEC1 on the efficiency of the editing.

25807502,APOBEC3A is implicated in a novel class of G-to-A mRNA editing in WT1 transcripts.,"Classic deamination mRNA changes, including cytidine to uridine (C-to-U) and adenosine to inosine (A-to-I), are important exceptions to the central dogma and lead to significant alterations in gene transcripts and products. Although there are a few reports of non-classic mRNA alterations, as yet there is no molecular explanation for these alternative changes. Wilms Tumor 1 (WT1) mutations and variants are implicated in several diseases, including Wilms tumor and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We observed two alternative G-to-A changes, namely c.1303G>A and c.1586G>A in cDNA clones and found them to be recurrent in a series of 21 umbilical cord blood mononuclear cell (CBMC) samples studied. Two less conserved U-to-C changes were also observed. These alternative changes were found to be significantly higher in non-progenitor as compared to progenitor CBMCs, while they were found to be absent in a series of AML samples studied, indicating they are targeted, cell type-specific mRNA editing modifications. Since APOBEC/ADAR family members are implicated in RNA/DNA editing, we screened them by RNA-interference (RNAi) for WT1-mRNA changes and observed near complete reversal of WT1 c.1303G>A alteration upon APOBEC3A (A3A) knockdown. The role of A3A in mediating this change was confirmed by A3A overexpression in Fujioka cells, which led to a significant increase in WT1 c.1303G>A mRNA editing. Non-progenitor CBMCs showed correspondingly higher levels of A3A-mRNA and protein as compared to the progenitor ones. To our knowledge, this is the first report of mRNA modifying activity for an APOBEC3 protein and implicates A3A in a novel G-to-A form of editing. These findings open the way to further investigations into the mechanisms of other potential mRNA changes, which will help to redefine the RNA editing paradigm in both health and disease.",2015,PLoS One. 2015 Mar 25;10(3):e0120089. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0120089. eCollection 2015.,"['Niavarani A', 'Currie E', 'Reyal Y', 'Anjos-Afonso F', 'Horswell S', 'Griessinger E', 'Luis Sardina J', 'Bonnet D']",False
25826567,Diverse selective regimes shape genetic diversity at ADAR genes and at their coding targets.,"A-to-I RNA editing operated by ADAR enzymes is extremely common in mammals. Several editing events in coding regions have pivotal physiological roles and affect protein sequence (recoding events) or function. We analyzed the evolutionary history of the 3 ADAR family genes and of their coding targets. Evolutionary analysis indicated that ADAR evolved adaptively in primates, with the strongest selection in the unique N-terminal domain of the interferon-inducible isoform. Positively selected residues in the human lineage were also detected in the ADAR deaminase domain and in the RNA binding domains of ADARB1 and ADARB2. During the recent history of human populations distinct variants in the 3 genes increased in frequency as a result of local selective pressures. Most selected variants are located within regulatory regions and some are in linkage disequilibrium with eQTLs in monocytes. Finally, analysis of conservation scores of coding editing sites indicated that editing events are counter-selected within regions that are poorly tolerant to change. Nevertheless, a minority of recoding events occurs at highly conserved positions and possibly represents the functional fraction. These events are enriched in pathways related to HIV-1 infection and to epidermis/hair development. Thus, both ADAR genes and their targets evolved under variable selective regimes, including purifying and positive selection. Pressures related to immune response likely represented major drivers of evolution for ADAR genes. As for their coding targets, we suggest that most editing events are slightly deleterious, although a minority may be beneficial and contribute to antiviral response and skin homeostasis.",2015,RNA Biol. 2015;12(2):149-61. doi: 10.1080/15476286.2015.1017215.,"['Forni D', 'Mozzi A', 'Pontremoli C', 'Vertemara J', 'Pozzoli U', 'Biasin M', 'Bresolin N', 'Clerici M', 'Cagliani R', 'Sironi M']",False
25826568,Noncoding regions of C. elegans mRNA undergo selective adenosine to inosine deamination and contain a small number of editing sites per transcript.,"ADARs (Adenosine deaminases that act on RNA) ""edit"" RNA by converting adenosines to inosines within double-stranded regions. The primary targets of ADARs are long duplexes present within noncoding regions of mRNAs, such as introns and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs). Because adenosine and inosine have different base-pairing properties, editing within these regions can alter splicing and recognition by small RNAs. However, despite numerous studies identifying multiple editing sites in these genomic regions, little is known about the extent to which editing sites co-occur on individual transcripts or the functional output of these combinatorial editing events. To begin to address these questions, we performed an ultra-deep sequencing analysis of 4 Caenorhabditis elegans 3' UTRs that are known ADAR targets. Synchronous editing events were determined for the long duplexes in vivo. Furthermore, the validity of each editing event was confirmed by sequencing the same regions of mRNA from worms that lack A-to-I editing. This analysis identified a large number of editing sites that can occur within each 3' UTR, but interestingly, each individual transcript contained only a small fraction of these A-to-I editing events. In addition, editing patterns were not random, indicating that an editing event can affect the efficiency of editing at subsequent adenosines. Furthermore, we identified specific sites that can be both positively and negatively correlated with additional sites leading to mutually exclusive editing patterns.

25859542,A-to-I RNA Editing: Current Knowledge Sources and Computational Approaches with Special Emphasis on Non-Coding RNA Molecules.,"RNA editing is a dynamic mechanism for gene regulation attained through the alteration of the sequence of primary RNA transcripts. A-to-I (adenosine-to-inosine) RNA editing, which is catalyzed by members of the adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) family of enzymes, is the most common post-transcriptional modification in humans. The ADARs bind double-stranded regions and deaminate adenosine (A) into inosine (I), which in turn is interpreted by the translation and splicing machineries as guanosine (G). In recent years, this modification has been discovered to occur not only in coding RNAs but also in non-coding RNAs (ncRNA), such as microRNAs, small interfering RNAs, transfer RNAs, and long non-coding RNAs. This may have several consequences, such as the creation or disruption of microRNA/mRNA binding sites, and thus affect the biogenesis, stability, and target recognition properties of ncRNAs. The malfunction of the editing machinery is not surprisingly associated with various human diseases, such as neurodegenerative, cardiovascular, and carcinogenic diseases. Despite the enormous efforts made so far, the real biological function of this phenomenon, as well as the features of the ADAR substrate, in particular in non-coding RNAs, has still not been fully understood. In this work, we focus on the current knowledge of RNA editing on ncRNA molecules and provide a few examples of computational approaches to elucidate its biological function.",2015,Front Bioeng Biotechnol. 2015 Mar 25;3:37. doi: 10.3389/fbioe.2015.00037. eCollection 2015.,"['Nigita G', 'Veneziano D', 'Ferro A']",False
26133168,Cell Free DNA of Tumor Origin Induces a 'Metastatic' Expression Profile in HT-29 Cancer Cell Line.,"BACKGROUND: Epithelial cells in malignant conditions release DNA into the extracellular compartment. Cell free DNA of tumor origin may act as a ligand of DNA sensing mechanisms and mediate changes in epithelial-stromal interactions. AIMS: To evaluate and compare the potential autocrine and paracrine regulatory effect of normal and malignant epithelial cell-related DNA on TLR9 and STING mediated pathways in HT-29 human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells and normal fibroblasts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: DNA isolated from normal and tumorous colonic epithelia of fresh frozen surgically removed tissue samples was used for 24 and 6 hour treatment of HT-29 colon carcinoma and HDF-α fibroblast cells. Whole genome mRNA expression analysis and qRT-PCR was performed for the elements/members of TLR9 signaling pathway. Immunocytochemistry was performed for epithelial markers (i.e. CK20 and E-cadherin), DNA methyltransferase 3a (DNMT3a) and NFκB (for treated HDFα cells). RESULTS: Administration of tumor derived DNA on HT29 cells resulted in significant (p<0.05) mRNA level alteration in 118 genes (logFc≥1, p≤0.05), including overexpression of metallothionein genes (i.e. MT1H, MT1X, MT1P2, MT2A), metastasis-associated genes (i.e. TACSTD2, MACC1, MALAT1), tumor biomarker (CEACAM5), metabolic genes (i.e. INSIG1, LIPG), messenger molecule genes (i.e. DAPP, CREB3L2). Increased protein levels of CK20, E-cadherin, and DNMT3a was observed after tumor DNA treatment in HT-29 cells. Healthy DNA treatment affected mRNA expression of 613 genes (logFc≥1, p≤0.05), including increased expression of key adaptor molecules of TLR9 pathway (e.g. MYD88, IRAK2, NFκB, IL8, IL-1β), STING pathway (ADAR, IRF7, CXCL10, CASP1) and the FGF2 gene. CONCLUSIONS: DNA from tumorous colon epithelium, but not from the normal epithelial cells acts as a pro-metastatic factor to HT-29 cells through the overexpression of pro-metastatic genes through TLR9/MYD88 independent pathway. In contrast, DNA derived from healthy colonic epithelium induced TLR9 and STING signaling pathway in normal fibroblasts.",2015,PLoS One. 2015 Jul 2;10(7):e0131699. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0131699. eCollection 2015.,"['Fűri I', 'Kalmár A', 'Wichmann B', 'Spisák S', 'Schöller A', 'Barták B', 'Tulassay Z', 'Molnár B']",False
26253977,Biochemical and Transcriptome-Wide Identification of A-to-I RNA Editing Sites by ICE-Seq.,"Inosine (I) is a modified adenosine (A) in RNA. In Metazoa, I is generated by hydrolytic deamination of A, catalyzed by adenosine deaminase acting RNA (ADAR) in a process called A-to-I RNA editing. A-to-I RNA editing affects various biological processes by modulating gene expression. In addition, dysregulation of A-to-I RNA editing results in pathological consequences. I on RNA strands is converted to guanosine (G) during cDNA synthesis by reverse transcription. Thus, the conventional method used to identify A-to-I RNA editing sites compares cDNA sequences with their corresponding genomic sequences. Combined with deep sequencing, this method has been applied to transcriptome-wide screening of A-to-I RNA editing sites. This approach, however, produces a large number of false positives mainly owing to mapping errors. To address this issue, we developed a biochemical method called inosine chemical erasing (ICE) to reliably identify genuine A-to-I RNA editing sites. In addition, we applied the ICE method combined with RNA-seq, referred to as ICE-seq, to identify transcriptome-wide A-to-I RNA editing sites. In this chapter, we describe the detailed protocol for ICE-seq, which can be applied to various sources and taxa.",2015,Methods Enzymol. 2015;560:331-53. doi: 10.1016/bs.mie.2015.03.014.

26367194,Electro-hyperthermia inhibits glioma tumorigenicity through the induction of E2F1-mediated apoptosis.,"PURPOSE: Modulated electro-hyperthermia (mEHT), also known as oncothermia, shows remarkable treatment efficacies for various types of tumours, including glioma. The aim of the present study was to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying phenotypic changes in oncothermic cancer cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: U87-MG and A172 human glioma cells were exposed to mEHT (42 °C/60 min) three times with a 2-day interval and subsequently tested for growth inhibition using MTS, FACS and microscopic analysis. To obtain insights into the molecular changes in response to mEHT, global changes in gene expression were examined using RNA sequencing. For in vivo evaluation of mEHT, we used U87-MG glioma xenografts grown in nude mice. RESULTS: mEHT inhibited glioma cell growth through the strong induction of apoptosis. The transcriptomic analysis of differential gene expression under mEHT showed that the anti-proliferative effects were induced through a subset of molecular alterations, including the up-regulation of E2F1 and CPSF2 and the down-regulation of ADAR and PSAT1. Subsequent Western blotting revealed that mEHT increased the levels of E2F1 and p53 and decreased the level of PARP-1, accelerating apoptotic signalling in glioma cells. mEHT significantly suppressed the growth of human glioma xenografts in nude mice. We also observed that mEHT dramatically reduced the portion of CD133(+) glioma stem cell population and suppressed cancer cell migration and sphere formation. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that mEHT suppresses glioma cell proliferation and mobility through the induction of E2F1-mediated apoptosis and might be an effective treatment for eradicating brain tumours.",2015,Int J Hyperthermia. 2015;31(7):784-92. doi: 10.3109/02656736.2015.1069411.

26383032,Acquisition of conditioned fear is followed by region-specific changes in RNA editing of glutamate receptors.,"Adenosine (A) to inosine (I) RNA editing is a post-transcriptional modification process that can affect synaptic function. Transcripts encoding the kainate GRIK1 and AMPA GluA2 glutamate receptor subunits undergo editing that leads to a glycine/arginine (Q/R) exchange and reduced Ca(2+) permeability. We hypothesized that editing at these sites could be experience-dependent, temporally dynamic and region-specific. We trained C57/Bl6 mice in trace and contextual fear conditioning protocols, and examined editing levels at GRIK1 and GluA2 Q/R sites in the amygdala (CeA) and hippocampus (CA1 and CA3), at two time points after training. We also examined experience-dependent changes in the expression of RNA editing enzymes and editing targets. Animals trained in the trace fear conditioning protocol exhibited a transient increase in unedited GRIK1 RNA in the amygdala, and their learning efficiency correlated with unedited RNA levels in CA1. In line with previous reports, GluA2 RNA editing levels were nearly 100%. Additionally, we observed experience-dependent changes in mRNA expression of the RNA editing enzymes ADAR2 and ADAR1 in amygdala and hippocampus, and a learning-dependent increase in the alternatively spliced inactive form of ADAR2 in the amygdala. Since unedited transcripts code for Ca(2+)-permeable receptor subunits, these findings suggest that RNA editing at Q/R sites of glutamate receptors plays an important role in experience-dependent synaptic modification processes.",2015,Stress. 2015;18(3):309-18. doi: 10.3109/10253890.2015.1073254.,"['Brande-Eilat N', 'Golumbic YN', 'Zaidan H', 'Gaisler-Salomon I']",False
26512413,Genome-wide identification and characterization of tissue-specific RNA editing events in D. melanogaster and their potential role in regulating alternative splicing.,"RNA editing is a widespread mechanism that plays a crucial role in diversifying gene products. Its abundance and importance in regulating cellular processes were revealed using new sequencing technologies. The majority of these editing events, however, cannot be associated with regulatory mechanisms. We use tissue-specific high-throughput libraries of D. melanogaster to study RNA editing. We introduce an analysis pipeline that utilises large input data and explicitly captures ADAR's requirement for double-stranded regions. It combines probabilistic and deterministic filters and can identify RNA editing events with a low estimated false positive rate. Analyzing ten different tissue types, we predict 2879 editing sites and provide their detailed characterization. Our analysis pipeline accurately distinguishes genuine editing sites from SNPs and sequencing and mapping artifacts. Our editing sites are 3 times more likely to occur in exons with multiple splicing acceptor/donor sites than in exons with unique splice sites (p-value < 2.10(-15)). Furthermore, we identify 244 edited regions where RNA editing and alternative splicing are likely to influence each other. For 96 out of these 244 regions, we find evolutionary evidence for conserved RNA secondary-structures near splice sites suggesting a potential regulatory mechanism where RNA editing may alter splicing patterns via changes in local RNA structure.",2015,RNA Biol. 2015;12(12):1391-401. doi: 10.1080/15476286.2015.1107703.,"['Mazloomian A', 'Meyer IM']",False
26629815,ADAR1 Facilitates HIV-1 Replication in Primary CD4+ T Cells.,"Unlike resting CD4+ T cells, activated CD4+T cells are highly susceptible to infection of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1). HIV-1 infects T cells and macrophages without activating the nucleic acid sensors and the anti-viral type I interferon response. Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) is an RNA editing enzyme that displays antiviral activity against several RNA viruses. Mutations in ADAR1 cause the autoimmune disorder Aicardi-Goutieères syndrome (AGS). This disease is characterized by an inappropriate activation of the interferon-stimulated gene response. Here we show that HIV-1 replication, in ADAR1-deficient CD4+T lymphocytes from AGS patients, is blocked at the level of protein translation. Furthermore, viral protein synthesis block is accompanied by an activation of interferon-stimulated genes. RNA silencing of ADAR1 in Jurkat cells also inhibited HIV-1 protein synthesis.

26798338,Local Mutational Pressures in Genomes of Zaire Ebolavirus and Marburg Virus.,"Heterogeneities in nucleotide content distribution along the length of Zaire ebolavirus and Marburg virus genomes have been analyzed. Results showed that there is asymmetric mutational A-pressure in the majority of Zaire ebolavirus genes; there is mutational AC-pressure in the coding region of the matrix protein VP40, probably, caused by its high expression at the end of the infection process; there is also AC-pressure in the 3'-part of the nucleoprotein (NP) coding gene associated with low amount of secondary structure formed by the 3'-part of its mRNA; in the middle of the glycoprotein (GP) coding gene that kind of mutational bias is linked with the high amount of secondary structure formed by the corresponding fragment of RNA negative (-) strand; there is relatively symmetric mutational AU-pressure in the polymerase (Pol) coding gene caused by its low expression level. In Marburg virus all genes, including C-rich fragment of GP coding region, demonstrate asymmetric mutational A-bias, while the last gene (Pol) demonstrates more symmetric mutational AU-pressure.

25010446,NMR study of the Z-DNA binding mode and B-Z transition activity of the Zα domain of human ADAR1 when perturbed by mutation on the α3 helix and β-hairpin.,"The Zα domains of human ADAR1 (ZαADAR1) bind to Z-DNA via interaction mediated by the α3-core and β-hairpin. Five residues in the α3 helix and four residues in the β-hairpin play important roles in Zα function, forming direct or water-mediated hydrogen bonds with DNA backbone phosphates or interacting hydrophobically with DNA bases. To understand the roles of these residues during B-Z transition of duplex DNA, we performed NMR experiments on complexes of various ZαADAR1 mutants with a 6-bp DNA duplex at various protein-to-DNA molar ratios. Our study suggests that single mutations at residues K169, N173, or Y177 cause unusual conformational changes in the hydrophobic faces of helices α1, α2, and α3, which dramatically decrease the Z-DNA binding affinity. 1D imino proton spectra and chemical shift perturbation showed that single mutations at residues K170, R174, T191, P192, P193, or W195 slightly affected the Z-DNA binding affinity. A hydrogen exchange study proved that the K170A- and R174A-ZαADAR1 proteins could efficiently change B-DNA to left-handed Z-DNA via an active B-Z transition pathway, whereas the G2·C5 base pair was significantly destabilized compared to wild-type ZαADAR1.",2014 Sep 15,Arch Biochem Biophys. 2014 Sep 15;558:95-103. doi: 10.1016/j.abb.2014.06.026.

25408845,The Supraspliceosome - A Multi-Task Machine for Regulated Pre-mRNA Processing in the Cell Nucleus.,"Pre-mRNA splicing of Pol II transcripts is executed in the mammalian cell nucleus within a huge (21 MDa) and highly dynamic RNP machine - the supraspliceosome. It is composed of four splicing active native spliceosomes, each resembling an in vitro assembled spliceosome, which are connected by the pre-mRNA. Supraspliceosomes harbor protein splicing factors and all the five-spliceosomal U snRNPs. Recent analysis of specific supraspliceosomes at defined splicing stages revealed that they harbor all five spliceosomal U snRNAs at all splicing stages. Supraspliceosomes harbor additional pre-mRNA processing components, such as the 5'-end and 3'-end processing components, and the RNA editing enzymes ADAR1 and ADAR2. The structure of the native spliceosome, at a resolution of 20 Å, was determined by cryo-EM. A unique spatial arrangement of the spliceosomal U snRNPs within the native spliceosome emerged from in-silico studies, localizing the five U snRNPs mostly within its large subunit, and sheltering the active core components deep within the spliceosomal cavity. The supraspliceosome provides a platform for coordinating the numerous processing steps that the pre-mRNA undergoes: 5' and 3'-end processing activities, RNA editing, constitutive and alternative splicing, and processing of intronic microRNAs. It also harbors a quality control mechanism termed suppression of splicing (SOS) that, under normal growth conditions, suppresses splicing at abundant intronic latent 5' splice sites in a reading frame-dependent fashion. Notably, changes in these regulatory processing activities are associated with human disease and cancer. These findings emphasize the supraspliceosome as a multi-task master regulator of pre-mRNA processing in the cell nucleus.",2014 Sep,Comput Struct Biotechnol J. 2014 Sep 28;11(19):113-22. doi: 10.1016/j.csbj.2014.09.008. eCollection 2014 Sep.,"['Shefer K', 'Sperling J', 'Sperling R']",False

A to I editing is widespread and required for normal life. By comparing deep sequencing data of brain miRNAs from wild-type and ADAR2 deficient mouse strains, we detect editing sites and altered miRNA processing at high sensitivity. We detect 48 novel editing events in miRNAs. Some editing events reach frequencies of up to 80%. About half of all editing events depend on ADAR2 while some miRNAs are preferentially edited by ADAR1. Sixty-four percent of all editing events are located within the seed region of mature miRNAs. For the highly edited miR-3099, we experimentally prove retargeting of the edited miRNA to novel 3' UTRs. We show further that an abundant editing event in miR-497 promotes processing by Drosha of the corresponding pri-miRNA. We also detect reproducible changes in the abundance of specific miRNAs in ADAR2-deficient mice that occur independent of adjacent A to I editing events. This indicates that ADAR2 binding but not editing of miRNA precursors may influence their processing. Correlating with changes in miRNA abundance we find misregulation of putative targets of these miRNAs in the presence or absence of ADAR2.",2014 Oct 29,Nucleic Acids Res. 2014 Oct 29;42(19):12155-68. doi: 10.1093/nar/gku844.

24355598,The molecular link between inefficient GluA2 Q/R site-RNA editing and TDP-43 pathology in motor neurons of sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients.,"TAR DNA-binding protein (TDP-43) pathology and reduced expression of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 2 (ADAR2), which is the RNA editing enzyme responsible for adenosine-to-inosine conversion at the GluA2 glutamine/arginine (Q/R) site, concomitantly occur in the same motor neurons of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients; this finding suggests a link between these two ALS-specific molecular abnormalities. AMPA receptors containing Q/R site-unedited GluA2 in their subunit assembly are Ca(2+)-permeable, and motor neurons lacking ADAR2 undergo slow death in conditional ADAR2 knockout (AR2) mice, which is a mechanistic ALS model in which the ADAR2 gene is targeted in cholinergic neurons. Moreover, deficient ADAR2 induced mislocalization of TDP-43 similar to TDP-43 pathology seen in the sporadic ALS patients in the motor neurons of AR2 mice. The abnormal mislocalization of TDP-43 specifically resulted from activation of the Ca(2+)-dependent serine protease calpain that specifically cleaved TDP-43 at the C-terminal region, and generated aggregation-prone N-terminal fragments. Notably, the N-terminal fragments of TDP-43 lacking the C-terminus were demonstrated in the brains and spinal cords of ALS patients. Because normalization of either the Ca(2+)-permeability of AMPA receptors or the calpain activity in the motor neurons normalized the subcellular localization of TDP-43 in AR2 mice, it is likely that exaggerated calpain-dependent TDP-43 fragments played a role at least in the initiation of TDP-43 pathology. Elucidation of the molecular cascade of neuronal death induced by ADAR2 downregulation could provide a new specific therapy for sporadic ALS. In this review, we summarized the work from our group on the role of inefficient GluA2 Q/R site-RNA editing and TDP-43 pathology in sporadic ALS, and discussed possible effects of inefficient ADAR2-mediated RNA editing in general.",2014 Oct 10,Brain Res. 2014 Oct 10;1584:28-38. doi: 10.1016/j.brainres.2013.12.011.

25172485,Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 limits RIG-I RNA detection and suppresses IFN production responding to viral and endogenous RNAs.,"Type I IFNs play central roles in innate immunity; however, overproduction of IFN can lead to immunopathology. In this study, we demonstrate that adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1), an RNA-editing enzyme induced by IFN, is essential for cells to avoid inappropriate sensing of cytosolic RNA in an inducible knockout cell model-the primary mouse embryo fibroblast derived from ADAR1 lox/lox and Cre-ER mice as well as in HEK293 cells. ADAR1 suppresses viral and cellular RNA detection by retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) through its RNA binding rather than its RNA editing activity. dsRNA binds to both ADAR1 and RIG-I, but ADAR1 reduces RIG-I RNA binding. In the absence of ADAR1, cellular RNA stimulates type I IFN production without viral infection or exogenous RNA stimulation. Moreover, we showed in the ADAR1-inducible knockout mice that ADAR1 gene disruption results in high-level IFN production in neuronal tissues-the hallmark of Aicardi-Goutières syndrome, a heritable autoimmune disease recently found to be associated with ADAR1 gene mutations. In summary, this study found that ADAR1 limits cytosolic RNA sensing by RIG-I through its RNA binding activity; therefore, ADAR1 suppresses type I IFN production stimulated by viral and cellular RNAs. These results explain why loss of ADARA1 causes IFN induction and also indicates a mechanism for the involvement of ADAR1 in autoimmune diseases such as Aicardi-Goutières syndrome.",2014 Oct 1,J Immunol. 2014 Oct 1;193(7):3436-45. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1401136.

25064266,HIV-1 translation and its regulation by cellular factors PKR and PACT.,"The synthesis of proteins from viral mRNA is the first step towards viral assembly. Viruses are dependent upon the cellular translation machinery to synthesize their own proteins. The synthesis of proteins from the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 and 2 RNAs utilize several alternative mechanisms. The regulation of viral protein production requires a constant interplay between viral requirements and the cell response to viral infection. Among the antiviral cell responses, the interferon-induced RNA activated protein kinase, PKR, regulates the cellular and viral translation. During HIV-1 infection, PKR activation is highly regulated by viral and cellular factors. The cellular TAR RNA Binding Protein, TRBP, the Adenosine Deaminase acting on RNA, ADAR1, and the PKR Activator, PACT, play important roles. Recent data show that PACT changes its function from activator to inhibitor in HIV-1 infected cells. Therefore, HIV-1 has evolved to replicate in cells in which TRBP, ADAR1 and PACT prevent PKR activation to allow efficient viral protein synthesis.

We demonstrate that Adar1 embryonic lethality is rescued to live birth in Adar1; Mavs double mutants in which the antiviral interferon induction response to cytoplasmic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is prevented. Aberrant immune responses in Adar1 mutant mouse embryo fibroblasts are dramatically reduced by restoring the expression of editing-active cytoplasmic ADARs.

ADAR1-p150 is an Interferon Stimulated Gene (ISG) induced by IFN-I that can edit viral RNAs. We therefore investigated whether it could play the role of an anti-HTLV factor. RESULTS: We demonstrate here that ADAR1 is also expressed in the absence of IFN stimulation in activated primary T-lymphocytes that are the natural target of this virus and in HTLV-1 or HTLV-2 chronically infected T-cells. ADAR1 expression is also increased in primary lymphocytes obtained from HTLV-1 infected individuals. We show that ADAR1 enhances HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 infection in T-lymphocytes and that this proviral effect is independent from its editing activity. ADAR1 expression suppresses IFN-α inhibitory effect on HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 and acts through the repression of PKR phosphorylation. DISCUSSION: This study demonstrates that two interferon stimulated genes, i.e. PKR and ADAR1 have opposite effects on HTLV replication in vivo.

25098560,Genetic polymorphisms associated with rubella virus-specific cellular immunity following MMR vaccination.,"Rubella virus causes a relatively benign disease in most cases, although infection during pregnancy can result in serious birth defects. An effective vaccine has been available since the early 1970s and outbreaks typically do not occur among highly vaccinated (≥2 doses) populations. Nevertheless, considerable inter-individual variation in immune response to rubella immunization does exist, with single-dose seroconversion rates ~95 %. Understanding the mechanisms behind this variability may provide important insights into rubella immunity. In the current study, we examined associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in selected cytokine, cytokine receptor, and innate/antiviral genes and immune responses following rubella vaccination in order to understand genetic influences on vaccine response. Our approach consisted of a discovery cohort of 887 subjects aged 11-22 at the time of enrollment and a replication cohort of 542 older adolescents and young adults (age 18-40). Our data indicate that SNPs near the butyrophilin genes (BTN3A3/BTN2A1) and cytokine receptors (IL10RB/IFNAR1) are associated with variations in IFNγ secretion and that multiple SNPs in the PVR gene, as well as SNPs located in the ADAR gene, exhibit significant associations with rubella virus-specific IL-6 secretion. This information may be useful, not only in furthering our understanding immune responses to rubella vaccine, but also in identifying key pathways for targeted adjuvant use to boost immunity in those with weak or absent immunity following vaccination.",2014 Nov,Hum Genet. 2014 Nov;133(11):1407-17. doi: 10.1007/s00439-014-1471-z.

25136968,"Characterizing of functional human coding RNA editing from evolutionary, structural, and dynamic perspectives.","A-to-I RNA editing has been recently shown to be a widespread phenomenon with millions of sites spread in the human transcriptome. However, only few are known to be located in coding sequences and modify the amino acid sequence of the protein product. Here, we used high-throughput data, variant prediction tools, and protein structural information in order to find structural and functional preferences for coding RNA editing. We show that RNA editing has a unique pattern of amino acid changes characterized by enriched stop-to-tryptophan changes, positive-to-neutral and neutral-to-positive charge changes. RNA editing tends to have stronger structural effect than equivalent A-to-G SNPs but weaker effect than random A-to-G mutagenesis events. Sites edited at low level tend to be located at conserved positions with stronger predicted deleterious effect on proteins comparing to sites edited at high frequencies. Lowly edited sites tend to destabilize the protein structure and affect amino acids with larger number of intra-molecular contacts. Still, some highly edited sites are predicted also to prominently affect structure and tend to be located at critical positions of the protein matrix and are likely to be functionally important. Using our pipeline, we identify and discuss several novel putative functional coding changing editing sites in the genes COPA (I164V), GIPC1 (T62A), ZN358 (K382R), and CCNI (R75G).",2014 Nov,Proteins. 2014 Nov;82(11):3117-31. doi: 10.1002/prot.24672.

25344900,Understanding the recognition mechanisms of Zα domain of human editing enzyme ADAR1 (hZα(ADAR1)) and various Z-DNAs from molecular dynamics simulation.,"The Z-DNA-binding domain of human double-stranded RNA adenosine deaminase I (hZαADAR1) can specifically recognize the left-handed Z-DNA which preferentially occurs at alternating purine-pyrimidine repeats, especially the CG-repeats. The interactions of hZαADAR1 and Z-DNAs in different sequence contexts can affect many important biological functions including gene regulation and chromatin remodeling. Therefore it is of great necessity to fully understand their recognition mechanisms. However, most existing studies are aimed at the standard CG-repeat Z-DNA rather than the non-CG-repeats, and whether the molecular basis of hZαADAR1 binding to various Z-DNAs are identical or not is still unclear on the atomic level. Here, based on the recently determined crystal structures of three representative non-CG-repeat Z-DNAs (d(CACGTG)2, d(CGTACG)2 and d(CGGCCG)2) in complex with hZαADAR1, 40 ns molecular dynamics simulation together with binding free energy calculation were performed for each system. For comparison, the standard CG-repeat Z-DNA (d(CGCGCG)2) complexed with hZαADAR1 was also simulated. The consistent results demonstrate that nonpolar interaction is the driving force during the protein-DNA binding process, and that polar interaction mainly from helix α3 also provides important contributions. Five common hot-spot residues were identified, namely Lys169, Lys170, Asn173, Arg174 and Tyr177. Hydrogen bond analysis coupled with surface charge distribution further reveal the interfacial information between hZαADAR1 and Z-DNA in detail. All of the analysis illustrate that four complexes share the common key features and the similar binding modes irrespective of Z-DNA sequences, suggesting that Z-DNA recognition by hZαADAR1 is conformation-specific rather than sequence-specific. Additionally, by analyzing the conformational changes of hZαADAR1, we found that the binding of Z-DNA could effectively stabilize hZαADAR1 protein. Our study can provide some valuable information for better understanding the binding mechanism between hZαADAR1 or even other Z-DNA-binding protein and Z-DNA.",2014 Nov,J Mol Model. 2014 Nov;20(11):2500. doi: 10.1007/s00894-014-2500-5.

24753571,A bimodular nuclear localization signal assembled via an extended double-stranded RNA-binding domain acts as an RNA-sensing signal for transportin 1.,"The human RNA-editing enzyme adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR1) carries a unique nuclear localization signal (NLS) that overlaps one of its double-stranded RNA-binding domains (dsRBDs). This dsRBD-NLS is recognized by the nuclear import receptor transportin 1 (Trn1; also called karyopherin-β2) in an RNA-sensitive manner. Most Trn1 cargos bear a well-characterized proline-tyrosine-NLS, which is missing from the dsRBD-NLS. Here, we report the structure of the dsRBD-NLS, which reveals an unusual dsRBD fold extended by an additional N-terminal α-helix that brings the N- and C-terminal flanking regions in close proximity. We demonstrate experimentally that the atypical ADAR1-NLS is bimodular and is formed by the combination of the two flexible fragments flanking the folded domain. The intervening dsRBD acts only as an RNA-sensing scaffold, allowing the two NLS modules to be properly positioned for interacting with Trn1. We also provide a structural model showing how Trn1 can recognize the dsRBD-NLS and how dsRNA binding can interfere with Trn1 binding.",2014 May 6,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2014 May 6;111(18):E1852-61. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1323698111.

24345557,Enhancement of alcohol drinking in mice depends on alterations in RNA editing of serotonin 2C receptors.,"Serotonin 2C receptors (5-HT(2C)R) are G-protein-coupled receptors with various actions, including involvement in drug addiction. 5-HT2CR undergoes mRNA editing, converting genomically encoded adenosine residues to inosines via adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs). Here we show that enhanced alcohol drinking behaviour in mice is associated with the degree of 5-HT(2C)R mRNA editing in the nucleus accumbens and dorsal raphe nuceus, brain regions important for reward and addiction. Following chronic alcohol vapour exposure, voluntary alcohol intake increased in C57BL/6J mice, but remained unchanged in C3H/HeJ and DBA/2J mice. 5-HT(2C)R mRNA editing frequency in both regions increased significantly in C57BL/6J mice, as did expressions of 5-HT(2C)R, ADAR1 and ADAR2, but not in other strains. Moreover, mice that exclusively express the unedited isoform (INI) of 5-HT(2C)R mRNA on a C57BL/6J background did not exhibit increased alcohol intake compared with wild-type mice. Our results indicate that alterations in 5-HT(2C)R mRNA editing underlie alcohol preference in mice.",2014 May,Int J Neuropsychopharmacol. 2014 May;17(5):739-51. doi: 10.1017/S1461145713001545.

24440912,ADAR1 deaminase contributes to scheduled skeletal myogenesis progression via stage-specific functions.,"Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) catalyzes cellular RNA adenosine-to-inosine editing events on structured RNA molecules. In line with this critical role, ADAR1 exhibits ubiquitous expression and is essential for embryonic development. However, regulation and developmental significance of this RNA editor in a spatiotemporal context are largely elusive. Here we unveil a novel tissue-specific role of ADAR1 in skeletal myogenesis. ADAR1 expression displayed programmed alteration that is coordinated with differentiation cues, and mediated negatively by miRNA-1/206. Coincidently, ADAR1 exerts stage-dependent functions-suppression of apoptosis at the onset of differentiation and preservation of timely myotube formation through later phase. Furthermore, the post-transcriptional aspect of its myogenic role was illustrated by the spectrum of binding RNAs, as revealed by high-throughput approach, as well as by direct regulation of myogenesis-associated targets such as dynamin 1/2 (Dnm1/2) and annexin A4. Consequently, maintenance of target gene expression profiles likely contributes to a state of cytoskeleton and membrane dynamics that is amenable to myoblast morphogenesis. Collectively, these findings uncover a critical link of ADAR1 to myogenesis, and further highlight an epigenetic mechanism by which ADAR1 and miR-1/206 interplay to control scheduled myoblast-myotube transition.",2014 May,Cell Death Differ. 2014 May;21(5):707-19. doi: 10.1038/cdd.2013.197.

23766440,A disrupted RNA editing balance mediated by ADARs (Adenosine DeAminases that act on RNA) in human hepatocellular carcinoma.,"OBJECTIVE: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a heterogeneous tumour displaying a complex variety of genetic and epigenetic changes. In human cancers, aberrant post-transcriptional modifications, such as alternative splicing and RNA editing, may lead to tumour specific transcriptome diversity. DESIGN: By utilising large scale transcriptome sequencing of three paired HCC clinical specimens and their adjacent non-tumour (NT) tissue counterparts at depth, we discovered an average of 20 007 inferred A to I (adenosine to inosine) RNA editing events in transcripts. The roles of the double stranded RNA specific ADAR (Adenosine DeAminase that act on RNA) family members (ADARs) and the altered gene specific editing patterns were investigated in clinical specimens, cell models and mice. RESULTS: HCC displays a severely disrupted A to I RNA editing balance. ADAR1 and ADAR2 manipulate the A to I imbalance of HCC via their differential expression in HCC compared with NT liver tissues. Patients with ADAR1 overexpression and ADAR2 downregulation in tumours demonstrated an increased risk of liver cirrhosis and postoperative recurrence and had poor prognoses. Due to the differentially expressed ADAR1 and ADAR2 in tumours, the altered gene specific editing activities, which was reflected by the hyper-editing of FLNB (filamin B, β) and the hypo-editing of COPA (coatomer protein complex, subunit α), are closely associated with HCC pathogenesis. In vitro and in vivo functional assays prove that ADAR1 functions as an oncogene while ADAR2 has tumour suppressive ability in HCC. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the fact that the differentially expressed ADARs in tumours, which are responsible for an A to I editing imbalance, has great prognostic value and diagnostic potential for HCC.",2014 May,Gut. 2014 May;63(5):832-43. doi: 10.1136/gutjnl-2012-304037.

24440630,Unique nuclear vacuoles in the motor neurons of conditional ADAR2-knockout mice.,"A reduction in adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 2 (ADAR2) activity causes the death of spinal motor neurons specifically via the GluA2 Q/R site-RNA editing failure in sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We studied, over time, the spinal cords of ADAR2-knockout mice, which are the mechanistic model mice for sporadic ALS, using homozygous ADAR2(flox/flox)/VAChT-Cre.Fast (AR2), homozygous ADAR2(flox/flox)/VAChT-Cre.Slow (AR2Slow), and heterozygous ADAR2(flox/+)/VAChT-Cre.Fast (AR2H) mice. The conditional ADAR2-knockout mice were divided into 3 groups by stage: presymptomatic (AR2H mice), early symptomatic (AR2 mice, AR2H mice) and late symptomatic (AR2Slow mice). Light-microscopically, some motor neurons in AR2 and AR2H mice (presymptomatic) showed simple neuronal atrophy and astrogliosis, and AR2H (early symptomatic) and AR2Slow mice often showed vacuoles predominantly in motor neurons. The number of vacuole-bearing anterior horn neurons decreased with the loss of anterior horn neurons in AR2H mice after 40 weeks of age. Electron-microscopically, in AR2 mice, while the cytoplasm of normal-looking motor neurons was almost always normal-appearing, the interior of dendrites was frequently loose and disorganized. In AR2H and AR2Slow mice, large vacuoles without a limiting membrane were observed in the anterior horns, preferentially in the nuclei of motor neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Nuclear vacuoles were not observed in AR2res (ADAR2(flox/flox)/VAChT-Cre.Fast/GluR-B(R/R)) mice, in which motor neurons express edited GluA2 in the absence of ADAR2. These findings suggest that ADAR2-reduction is associated with progressive deterioration of nuclear architecture, resulting in vacuolated nuclei due to a Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptor-mediated mechanism.",2014 Mar 6,Brain Res. 2014 Mar 6;1550:36-46. doi: 10.1016/j.brainres.2014.01.006.

24192045,ADAR1 is involved in the regulation of reprogramming human fibroblasts to induced pluripotent stem cells.,"Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing is a post-transcriptional, site-specific modification process that is catalyzed by Adenosine Deaminase Acting on RNA (ADAR) gene family members. Since ADARs act on double-stranded RNA, most A-to-I editing occurs within repetitive elements, particularly Alu elements, as the result of the inherent property of these sequences to fold and form double strands. ADAR1-mediated A-to-I RNA editing was recently implicated in the regulation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Spontaneous and neuronal differentiation of hESC was shown to result in a decrease in A-to-I editing levels. Knockdown of ADAR1 in hESCs results in an elevation of the expression of differentiation-related genes. In addition, we found that hESCs over-expressing ADAR1 could not be generated. The current study shows that the editing levels of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) change throughout reprogramming, from a source cell level to a level similar to that of hESCs. Up- or down-regulation of the ADAR1 level in human foreskin fibroblast (HFF) cells before induction of reprogramming results in varied reprogramming efficiencies. Furthermore, HFF-iPSC early clones derived from source cells in which the ADAR1 level was down-regulated lose their iPSC properties shortly after iPSC colony formation and instead exhibit characteristics of cancer cells. Taken together, our results imply a role for ADAR1 in the regulation of pluripotency induction as well as in the maintenance of early iPSC properties.",2014 Mar 1,Stem Cells Dev. 2014 Mar 1;23(5):443-56. doi: 10.1089/scd.2013.0206.

24556721,RNA editome imbalance in hepatocellular carcinoma.,"Adenosine-to-inosine conversion (A-to-I editing), a posttranscriptional modification on RNA, contributes to extensive transcriptome diversity. A-to-I editing is a hydrolytic deamination process, catalyzed by adenosine deAminase acting on double-stranded RNA (ADAR) family of enzymes. ADARs are essential for normal mammalian development, and disturbance in RNA editing has been implicated in various pathologic disorders, including cancer. Thanks to next-generation sequencing, rich databases of transcriptome evolution for cancer development at the resolution of single nucleotide have been generated. Extensive bioinformatic analysis revealed a complex picture of RNA editing change during transformation. Cancer displayed global hypoediting of Alu-repetitive elements with gene-specific editing pattern. In particular, hepatocellular carcinoma editome is severely disrupted and characterized by hyper- and hypoediting of different genes, such as hyperedited AZIN1 (antizyme inhibitor 1) and FLNB (filamin B, β) and hypoedited COPA (coatomer protein complex, subunit α). In hepatocellular carcinoma, not only the recoding editing in exons, but also the editing in noncoding regions (e.g., Alu-repetitive elements and microRNA) displays such complex editing pattern with site-specific editing trend.

Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing by ADAR proteins converts a genomically encoded adenosine into inosine. It is known that most RNA editing in human takes place in the primate-specific Alu sequences, but the extent of this phenomenon and its effect on transcriptome diversity are not yet clear. Here, we analyzed large-scale RNA-seq data and detected ∼1.6 million editing sites. As detection sensitivity increases with sequencing coverage, we performed ultradeep sequencing of selected Alu sequences and showed that the scope of editing is much larger than anticipated. We found that virtually all adenosines within Alu repeats that form double-stranded RNA undergo A-to-I editing, although most sites exhibit editing at only low levels (<1%). Moreover, using high coverage sequencing, we observed editing of transcripts resulting from residual antisense expression, doubling the number of edited sites in the human genome. Based on bioinformatic analyses and deep targeted sequencing, we estimate that there are over 100 million human Alu RNA editing sites, located in the majority of human genes.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential mutations in ADAR1 in seven Chinese families with DSH. METHODS: All the coding exons including adjacent intronic as well as 5' and 3' untranslated region (UTR) of ADAR1 were screened by direct sequencing. Moreover, quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain (qRT-PCR) and Western blot were applied to determine the pathogenic effects associated with the mutations. RESULTS: Molecular genetic investigations detected five novel mutations (c.556C > T, c.3001C > T, c.1936_1937insTG, c.1065_1068delGACA and c.1601G > A resulting in p.Gln186X, p.Arg1001Cys, p.Phe646LeufsX16, p.Asp357ArgfsX47 and p.Gly471AspfsX30 protein changes, respectively) as well as two previously reported (c.2744C > T and c.3463C > T causing p.Ser915Phe and p.Arg1155Trp protein changes, respectively). Among them, we found that the substitution c.1601G > A at the last nucleotide of exon 2 compromised the recognition of the splice donor site of intron 2, inducing an aberrant transcript with 190-bp deletion in exon 2 and causing an approximately 50% reduction of ADAR1 mRNA level in affected individual. In addition, consistent with the predicted results, the expression patterns of other novel mutations were detected by Western blot. CONCLUSION: We identified five novel and two recurrent mutations of the ADAR1 gene in seven Chinese families with DSH and investigated potential effects of the novel mutations in this study.

ADAR2 is the main enzyme responsible for recoding editing in humans. Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing at the Q/R site is reported to be decreased in gliomas; however, the expression of ADAR2 mRNA was not greatly affected. METHODS: We determined ADAR2 mRNA expression in human glioblastoma cell lines and in normal human glial cells by real-time RT-PCR. We also determined ADAR2 mRNA expression in 44 glioma tissues and normal white matter. After identifying an alternative splicing variant (ASV) of ADAR2 in gliomas, we performed sequencing. We then classified glioblastomas based on the presence (+) or absence (-) of the ASV to determine the correlations between ASV + and malignant features of glioblastomas, such as invasion, peritumoral brain edema, and survival time. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in ADAR2 mRNA expression among human glioblastoma cell lines or in gliomas compared with normal white matter (all p > 0.05). The ASV, which contained a 47-nucleotide insertion in the ADAR2 mRNA transcript, was detected in the U251 and BT325 cell lines, and in some glioma tissues. The expression rate of ASV differed among gliomas of different grades. ASV + glioblastomas were more malignant than ASV - glioblastomas. CONCLUSIONS: ADAR2 is a family of enzymes in which ASVs result in differences in enzymatic activity. The ADAR2 ASV may be correlated with the invasiveness of gliomas.

We have recently shown that miR-17 directly targets the ADAR1 gene and thereby enhances melanoma cell aggressiveness. miR-17 and miR-20a belong to the miR-17/92 complex, and their mature forms are identical except for two non-seed nucleotides. Nevertheless, here we show that these two miRNAs carry markedly different effects on melanoma cells. A strong positive correlation was observed between the expression of miR-17 and miR-20a among various melanoma cultures. Luciferase assays showed that miR-17 but not miR-20a directly targets the 3' untranslated region of the ADAR1 gene. Ectopic expression of these miRNAs in melanoma cells differentially alters the expression of five exemplar TargetScan-predicted target genes: ADAR1, ITGB8, TGFBR2, MMP2 and VEGF-A. Whole-genome expression microarrays confirm a markedly differential effect on the transcriptome. Functionally, over-expression of miR-20a but not of miR-17 in melanoma cells inhibits net proliferation in vitro. The differential functional effect was observed following ectopic expression of the mature miRNA or of the pre-miRNA sequences. This suggests that the two non-seed nucleotides dictate target sequence recognition and overall functional relevance. These miRNAs are clearly not redundant in melanoma cell biology.",2014 Jun,Open Biol. 2014 Jun;4(6):140030. doi: 10.1098/rsob.140030.,"['Greenberg E', 'Hajdu S', 'Nemlich Y', 'Cohen R', 'Itzhaki O', 'Jacob-Hirsch J', 'Besser MJ', 'Schachter J', 'Markel G']",True
24744243,Optimal guideRNAs for re-directing deaminase activity of hADAR1 and hADAR2 in trans.,"Adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADAR) are a class of enzymes that catalyze the conversion of adenosine to inosine in RNA. Since inosine is read as guanosine ADAR activity formally introduces A-to-G point mutations. Re-addressing ADAR activity toward new targets in an RNA-dependent manner is a highly rational, programmable approach for the manipulation of RNA and protein function. However, the strategy encounters limitations with respect to sequence and codon contexts. Selectivity is difficult to achieve in adenosine-rich sequences and some codons, like 5'-GAG, seem virtually inert. To overcome such restrictions, we systematically studied the possibilities of activating difficult codons by optimizing the guideRNA that is applied in trans. We find that all 5'-XAG codons with X = U, A, C, G are editable in vitro to a substantial amount of at least 50% once the guideRNA/mRNA duplex is optimized. Notably, some codons, including CAG and GAG, accept or even require the presence of 5'-mismatched neighboring base pairs. This was unexpected from the reported analysis of global editing preferences on large double-stranded RNA substrates. Furthermore, we report the usage of guanosine mismatching as a means to suppress unwanted off-site editing in proximity to targeted adenosine bases. Together, our findings are very important to achieve selective and efficient editing in difficult codon and sequence contexts.",2014 Jun,Nucleic Acids Res. 2014 Jun;42(10):e87. doi: 10.1093/nar/gku272.

The A-to-I deaminase enzymes (ADARs), which modify the adenosine, can alter the splicing and translation machineries, the double-stranded RNA structures and the binding affinity between RNA and RNA-binding proteins. ADAR activity is an essential mechanism in mammals and altered editing has been associated with several human diseases. Many efforts are now being concentrated on modifying ADAR activity in vivo in an attempt to correct RNA editing dysfunction. Concomitantly, ongoing studies aim to show the way that the ADAR deaminase domain can be used as a possible new tool, an intracellular Trojan horse, for the correction of heritage diseases not related to RNA editing events.",2014 Jun,Cell Tissue Res. 2014 Jun;356(3):527-32. doi: 10.1007/s00441-014-1863-3.

24829451,Genome-wide analysis of Alu editability.,"A-to-I RNA editing is apparently the most abundant post-transcriptional modification in primates. Virtually all editing sites reside within the repetitive Alu SINEs. Alu sequences are the dominant repeats in the human genome and thus are likely to pair with neighboring reversely oriented repeats and form double-stranded RNA structures that are bound by ADAR enzymes. Editing levels vary considerably between different adenosine sites within Alu repeats. Part of the variability has been explained by local sequence and structural motifs. Here, we focus on global characteristics that affect the editability at the Alu level. We use large RNA-seq data sets to analyze the editing levels in 203 798 Alu repeats residing within human genes. The most important factor affecting Alu editability is its distance to the closest reversely oriented neighbor-average editability decays exponentially with this distance, with a typical distance of ∼800 bp. This effect alone accounts for 28% of the total variance in editability. In addition, the number of Alu repeats of the same and reverse strand in the genomic vicinity, the expressed strand of the Alu, Alu's length and subfamily and the occurrence of reversely oriented neighbor in the same intron\exon all contribute, to a lesser extent, to the Alu editability.",2014 Jun,Nucleic Acids Res. 2014 Jun;42(11):6876-84. doi: 10.1093/nar/gku414.

24905200,"An RNA editor, adenosine deaminase acting on double-stranded RNA (ADAR1).","Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA1 (ADAR1) catalyzes the C6 deamination of adenosine (A) to produce inosine (I) in regions of RNA with double-stranded (ds) character. This process is known as A-to-I RNA editing. Alternative promoters drive the expression of the Adar1 gene and alternative splicing gives rise to transcripts that encode 2 ADAR1 protein size isoforms. ADAR1 p150 is an interferon (IFN)-inducible dsRNA adenosine deaminase found in the cytoplasm and nucleus, whereas ADAR1 p110 is constitutively expressed and nuclear in localization. Dependent on the duplex structure of the dsRNA substrate, deamination of adenosine by ADAR can be either highly site-selective or nonspecific. A-to-I editing can alter the stability of RNA structures and the coding of RNA as I is read as G instead of A by ribosomes during mRNA translation and by polymerases during RNA replication. A-to-I editing is of broad physiologic significance. Both the production and the action of IFNs, and hence the subsequent interaction of viruses with their hosts, are among the processes affected by A-to-I editing.",2014 Jun,J Interferon Cytokine Res. 2014 Jun;34(6):437-46. doi: 10.1089/jir.2014.0001.,"['George CX', 'John L', 'Samuel CE']",True
24813121,Novel interaction of the Z-DNA binding domain of human ADAR1 with the oncogenic c-Myc promoter G-quadruplex.,"Both G-quadruplex and Z-DNA can be formed in G-rich and repetitive sequences on genome, and their formation and biological functions are controlled by specific proteins. Z-DNA binding proteins, such as human ADAR1, have a highly conserved Z-DNA binding domain having selective affinity to Z-DNA. Here, our study identifies the Z-DNA binding domain of human ADAR1 (hZαADAR1) as a novel G-quadruplex binding protein that recognizes c-myc promoter G-quadruplex formed in NHEIII1 region and represses the gene expression. An electrophoretic migration shift assay shows the binding of hZαADAR1 to the intramolecular c-myc promoter G-quadruplex-forming DNA oligomer. To corroborate the binding of hZαADAR1 to the G-quadruplex, we conducted CD and NMR chemical shift perturbation analyses. CD results indicate that hZαADAR1 stabilizes the parallel-stranded conformation of the c-myc G-quadruplex. The NMR chemical shift perturbation data reveal that the G-quadruplex binding region in hZαADAR1 was almost identical with the Z-DNA binding region. Finally, promoter assay and Western blot analysis show that hZαADAR1 suppresses the c-myc expression promoted by NHEIII1 region containing the G-quadruplex-forming sequence. This finding suggests a novel function of Z-DNA binding protein as a regulator of G-quadruplex-mediated gene expression.",2014 Jul 15,J Mol Biol. 2014 Jul 15;426(14):2594-604. doi: 10.1016/j.jmb.2014.05.001.

25342944,Fluoxetine and all other SSRIs are 5-HT2B Agonists - Importance for their Therapeutic Effects.,"Fluoxetine and other serotonin-specific re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are generally thought to owe their therapeutic potency to inhibition of the serotonin transporter (SERT). However, research in our laboratory showed that it affects, with relatively high affinity the 5-HT2B receptor in cultured astrocytes; this finding was confirmed by independent observations showing that fluoxetine loses its ability to elicit SSRI-like responses in behavioral assays in mice in which the 5-HT2B receptor was knocked-out genetically or inhibited pharmacologically. All clinically used SSRIs are approximately equipotent towards 5-HT2B receptors and exert their effect on cultured astrocytes at concentrations similar to those used clinically, a substantial difference from their effect on SERT. We have demonstrated up-regulation and editing of astrocytic genes for ADAR2, the kainate receptor GluK2, cPLA2 and the 5-HT2B receptor itself after chronic treatment of cultures, which do not express SERT and after treatment of mice (expressing SERT) for 2 weeks with fluoxetine, followed by isolation of astrocytic and neuronal cell fractionation. Affected genes were identical in both experimental paradigms. Fluoxetine treatment also altered Ca(2+) homeostatic cascades, in a specific way that differs from that seen after treatment with the anti-bipolar drugs carbamazepine, lithium, or valproic acid. All changes occurred after a lag period similar to what is seen for fluoxetine's clinical effects, and some of the genes were altered in the opposite direction by mild chronic inescapable stress, known to cause anhedonia, a component of major depression. In the anhedonic mice these changes were reversed by treatment with SSRIs.",2014 Jul,Curr Neuropharmacol. 2014 Jul;12(4):365-79. doi: 10.2174/1570159X12666140828221720.,"['Peng L', 'Gu L', 'Li B', 'Hertz L']",True
24719423,hnRNP L and NF90 interact with hepatitis C virus 5'-terminal untranslated RNA and promote efficient replication.,"The 5'-terminal sequence of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) positive-strand RNA genome is essential for viral replication. Critical host factors, including a miR-122/Ago2 complex and poly(rC)-binding protein 2 (PCBP2), associate with this RNA segment. We used a biotinylated RNA pulldown approach to isolate host factors binding to the HCV 5' terminal 47 nucleotides and, in addition to Ago2 and PCBP2, identified several novel proteins, including IGF2BP1, hnRNP L, DHX9, ADAR1, and NF90 (ILF3). PCBP2, IGF2BP1, and hnRNP L bound single-stranded RNA, while DHX9, ADAR1, and NF90 bound a cognate double-stranded RNA bait. PCBP2, IGF2BP1, and hnRNP L binding were blocked by preannealing the single-stranded RNA bait with miR-122, indicating that they bind the RNA in competition with miR-122. However, IGF2BP1 binding was also inhibited by high concentrations of heparin, suggesting that it bound the bait nonspecifically. Among these proteins, small interfering RNA-mediated depletion of hnRNP L and NF90 significantly impaired viral replication and reduced infectious virus yields without substantially affecting HCV internal ribosome entry site-mediated translation. hnRNP L and NF90 were found to associate with HCV RNA in infected cells and to coimmunoprecipitate with NS5A in an RNA-dependent manner. Both also associate with detergent-resistant membranes where viral replication complexes reside. We conclude that hnRNP and NF90 are important host factors for HCV replication, at least in cultured cells, and may be present in the replication complex. IMPORTANCE: Although HCV replication has been intensively studied in many laboratories, many aspects of the viral life cycle remain obscure. Here, we use a novel RNA pulldown strategy coupled with mass spectrometry to identify host cell proteins that interact functionally with regulatory RNA elements located at the extreme 5' end of the positive-strand RNA genome. We identify two, primarily nuclear RNA-binding proteins, hnRNP L and NF90, with previously unrecognized proviral roles in HCV replication. The data presented add to current understanding of the replication cycle of this pathogenic human virus.",2014 Jul,J Virol. 2014 Jul;88(13):7199-209. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00225-14.

Extended dsRNA duplexes can be hyperedited by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR), which catalyzes adenosine (A)-to-inosine (I) editing. A-to-I editing has been reported for various viruses. A number of cellular antiviral defense strategies are stimulated by dsRNA, and this may involve hyperediting of dsRNA by ADARs, followed by targeted cleavage by cytoplasmic endonucleases. Here, we identify ADAR as a binding partner of BVDV NS4A in vitro and in vivo and show that the N-terminal domain of NS4A is the ADAR-binding domain. We also show that ADAR has an inhibitory effect on BVDV replication when overexpressed in BVDV-infected bovine cells. Our findings suggest a role of NS4A in the interaction of BVDV with ADAR that favors virus replication.",2014 Jul,Arch Virol. 2014 Jul;159(7):1735-41. doi: 10.1007/s00705-014-1997-3.

24906008,Reovirus-mediated induction of ADAR1 (p150) minimally alters RNA editing patterns in discrete brain regions.,"Transcripts encoding ADAR1, a double-stranded, RNA-specific adenosine deaminase involved in the adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing of mammalian RNAs, can be alternatively spliced to produce an interferon-inducible protein isoform (p150) that is up-regulated in both cell culture and in vivo model systems in response to pathogen or interferon stimulation. In contrast to other tissues, p150 is expressed at extremely low levels in the brain and it is unclear what role, if any, this isoform may play in the innate immune response of the central nervous system (CNS) or whether the extent of editing for RNA substrates critical for CNS function is affected by its induction. To investigate the expression of ADAR1 isoforms in response to viral infection and subsequent alterations in A-to-I editing profiles for endogenous ADAR targets, we used a neurotropic strain of reovirus to infect neonatal mice and quantify A-to-I editing in discrete brain regions using a multiplexed, high-throughput sequencing strategy. While intracranial injection of reovirus resulted in a widespread increase in the expression of ADAR1 (p150) in multiple brain regions and peripheral organs, significant changes in site-specific A-to-I conversion were quite limited, suggesting that steady-state levels of p150 expression are not a primary determinant for modulating the extent of editing for numerous ADAR targets in vivo.",2014 Jul,Mol Cell Neurosci. 2014 Jul;61:97-109. doi: 10.1016/j.mcn.2014.06.001.

Aberrant activation of WNT signaling is strongly implicated in the progression of cancer and controls CSCs properties. In this study we hypothesized that when cells were maintained as spheroids, the structure of CSCs could show differentiation between CSCs and non- CSCs. METHODS: CD133+/CD44+ cancer-initiating cells were isolated from DU-145 human prostate cancer cell line monolayer cultures, propagated as tumor spheroids and compared with the remaining heterogeneous cancer cells bulk population. The expression levels of WNT1, FZD1, ADAR, APC, AXIN, BTRC, FRAT1 and PPARD genes were measured by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) array assay and the protein expression levels of WNT1, FZD and AXIN by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: The expression levels of WNT pathway-related molecules were found to increase in both CSCs and non- CSCs when CSCs were maintained as spheroids. However, different expression profiles were observed when CSCs and non-CSCs were compared. In spheroids, the expression levels of FZD1, APC, ADAR, WNT1, PPARD genes in CSCs decreased when compared to non-CSCs. Interestingly, when CSCs from spheroids were compared with CSCs from monolayers the most significant decrease was observed in FZD1 and increase in APC genes. CONCLUSION: It is possible to assume that intracellular signaling of WNT-related molecules in the nucleus and/or cytoplasm might play an important role but it is independent from increased ligand expression and this expression strongly differentiate CSCs and non-CSCs population. This unexpected expression could be important for CSCs behavior and targeting this pathway could have therapeutic implications in cancer.",2014 Jan-Mar,J BUON. 2014 Jan-Mar;19(1):207-14.,"['Goksel G', 'Bilir A', 'Uslu R', 'Akbulut H', 'Guven U', 'Oktem G']",False
24393560,Mammalian conserved ADAR targets comprise only a small fragment of the human editosome.,"BACKGROUND: ADAR proteins are among the most extensively studied RNA binding proteins. They bind to their target and deaminate specific adenosines to inosines. ADAR activity is essential, and the editing of a subset of their targets is critical for viability. Recently, a huge number of novel ADAR targets were detected by analyzing next generation sequencing data. Most of these novel editing sites are located in lineage-specific genomic repeats, probably a result of overactivity of editing enzymes, thus masking the functional sites. In this study we aim to identify the set of mammalian conserved ADAR targets. RESULTS: We used RNA sequencing data from human, mouse, rat, cow, opossum, and platypus to define the conserved mammalian set of ADAR targets. We found that the conserved mammalian editing sites are surprisingly small in number and have unique characteristics that distinguish them from non-conserved ones. The sites that constitute the set have a distinct genomic distribution, tend to be located in genes encoding neurotransmitter receptors or other synapse related proteins, and have higher editing and expression levels. We also found a high consistency of editing levels of this set within mice strains and between human and mouse. Tight regulation of editing in these sites across strains and species implies their functional importance. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the discovery of numerous editing targets, only a small number of them are conserved within mammalian evolution. These sites are extremely highly conserved and exhibit unique features, such as tight regulation, and probably play a pivotal role in mammalian biology.",2014 Jan 7,Genome Biol. 2014 Jan 7;15(1):R5. doi: 10.1186/gb-2014-15-1-r5.,"['Pinto Y', 'Cohen HY', 'Levanon EY']",True
24460726,"Reduced levels of CCL2 and CXCL10 in systemic lupus erythematosus patients under treatment with prednisone, mycophenolate mofetil, or hydroxychloroquine, except in a high STAT1 subset.","INTRODUCTION: Our recent data showed that signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 (STAT1), adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR), C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), and C-X-C motif chemokine 10 (CXCL10) were significantly elevated in a systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) cohort compared to healthy donors. High and low STAT1 subsets were identified in SLE patient visits. The present study analyzed the correlation of common treatments used in SLE with the levels of these biomarkers. METHODS: Peripheral blood leukocytes were collected from 65 healthy donors and 103 SLE patients, of whom 60 had samples from two or more visits. Total RNA was isolated and analyzed for the expression of mRNA and microRNA using Taqman real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. Relative expression of interferon signature genes, CCL2, and CXCL10 were determined by the ΔΔCT method. Results were correlated with therapy using prednisone, mycophenolate mofetil, and hydroxychloroquine and analyzed by Wilcoxon/Kruskal-Wallis test and Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: CCL2 and CXCL10 were significantly higher in untreated patients compared to treated patients, however, in high STAT1 patient visits there is no significant difference between treated and untreated patients' visits. When comparing linear regression fits of interferon (IFN) score with CCL2 and CXCL10, untreated patients and high STAT1 patients displayed significantly higher slopes compared to treated patients. There was no significant difference between the slopes of high STAT1 and untreated patients indicating that CCL2 and CXCL10 were correlated with type-I IFN in high STAT1 patients similar to that in untreated patients. CCL2 and CXCL10 levels in the high STAT1 subset remained high in treated patient visits compared to those of the low STAT1 subset. CONCLUSIONS: Among the biomarkers analyzed, only CCL2 and CXCL10 showed significantly reduced levels in treated compared to untreated SLE patients. STAT1, CCL2, and CXCL10 are potentially useful indicators of therapeutic action in SLE patients. Further work is needed to determine whether high STAT1 levels convey resistance to therapies commonly used to treat SLE and whether STAT1 inhibitors may have therapeutic implication for these patients.",2014 Jan 24,Arthritis Res Ther. 2014 Jan 24;16(1):R23. doi: 10.1186/ar4451.,"['Dominguez-Gutierrez PR', 'Ceribelli A', 'Satoh M', 'Sobel ES', 'Reeves WH', 'Chan EK']",False

METHODS: Peripheral blood leukocytes were collected from 65 healthy donors and 103 SLE patients, 60 of whom had samples from 2 or more visits. Total RNA was isolated and analyzed for the expression of mRNA and microRNA using Taqman real time PCR assays. Relative expression of I-IFN signature genes, chemokines, and miR-146a were determined by the ΔΔCT method. Results were correlated with clinical data and analyzed by Wilcoxon/Kruskal-Wallis test and Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: Levels of ADAR, CCL2, CXCL10, and STAT1 in SLE were significantly elevated compared with the healthy controls (P <0.0001). ADAR, CCL2, and CXCL10 showed significant correlation with IFN score in both healthy donors (P <0.0033) and SLE patients (P <0.0001). In SLE patients, miR-146a level was not significantly different from healthy controls nor correlated to the IFN score. Two STAT1 populations were identified: a low STAT1 and a high STAT1 group. High STAT1 patient visits displayed higher (P ≤0.0020) levels of CCL2 and CXCL10 than the low STAT1 patient visits. STAT1 levels correlated with IFN score in low STAT1 group but not in high STAT1 group. More importantly, high STAT1 levels appeared as an enhancer of CCL2 and CXCL10 as indicated by the significantly stronger correlation of CCL2 and CXCL10 with IFN score in high STAT1 patient visits relative to low STAT1 patient visits. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate a novel role for STAT1 in the pathogenesis of SLE as an expression enhancer of CCL2 and CXCL10 in SLE patients with high levels of STAT1.

24443933,A role of ADAR2 and RNA editing of glutamate receptors in mood disorders and schizophrenia.,"BACKGROUND: Pre-mRNAs of 2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazol-4-yl)-propanoic acid (AMPA)/kainate glutamate receptors undergo post-transcriptional modification known as RNA editing that is mediated by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA type 2 (ADAR2). This modification alters the amino acid sequence and function of the receptor. Glutamatergic signaling has been suggested to have a role in mood disorders and schizophrenia, but it is unknown whether altered RNA editing of AMPA/kainate receptors has pathophysiological significance in these mental disorders. In this study, we found that ADAR2 expression tended to be decreased in the postmortem brains of patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. RESULTS: Decreased ADAR2 expression was significantly correlated with decreased editing of the R/G sites of AMPA receptors. In heterozygous Adar2 knockout mice (Adar2+/- mice), editing of the R/G sites of AMPA receptors was decreased. Adar2+/- mice showed a tendency of increased activity in the open-field test and a tendency of resistance to immobility in the forced swimming test. They also showed enhanced amphetamine-induced hyperactivity. There was no significant difference in amphetamine-induced hyperactivity between Adar2+/- and wild type mice after the treatment with an AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist, 2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo[f]quinoxaline. CONCLUSIONS: These findings collectively suggest that altered RNA editing efficiency of AMPA receptors due to down-regulation of ADAR2 has a possible role in the pathophysiology of mental disorders.",2014 Jan 21,Mol Brain. 2014 Jan 21;7:5. doi: 10.1186/1756-6606-7-5.,"['Kubota-Sakashita M', 'Iwamoto K', 'Bundo M', 'Kato T']",False
24137011,The ADAR RNA editing enzyme controls neuronal excitability in Drosophila melanogaster.,"RNA editing by deamination of specific adenosine bases to inosines during pre-mRNA processing generates edited isoforms of proteins. Recoding RNA editing is more widespread in Drosophila than in vertebrates. Editing levels rise strongly at metamorphosis, and Adar(5G1) null mutant flies lack editing events in hundreds of CNS transcripts; mutant flies have reduced viability, severely defective locomotion and age-dependent neurodegeneration. On the other hand, overexpressing an adult dADAR isoform with high enzymatic activity ubiquitously during larval and pupal stages is lethal. Advantage was taken of this to screen for genetic modifiers; Adar overexpression lethality is rescued by reduced dosage of the Rdl (Resistant to dieldrin), gene encoding a subunit of inhibitory GABA receptors. Reduced dosage of the Gad1 gene encoding the GABA synthetase also rescues Adar overexpression lethality. Drosophila Adar(5G1) mutant phenotypes are ameliorated by feeding GABA modulators. We demonstrate that neuronal excitability is linked to dADAR expression levels in individual neurons; Adar-overexpressing larval motor neurons show reduced excitability whereas Adar(5G1) null mutant or targeted Adar knockdown motor neurons exhibit increased excitability. GABA inhibitory signalling is impaired in human epileptic and autistic conditions, and vertebrate ADARs may have a relevant evolutionarily conserved control over neuronal excitability.",2014 Jan,Nucleic Acids Res. 2014 Jan;42(2):1139-51. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkt909.

24227841,Inosine-mediated modulation of RNA sensing by Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) and TLR8.,"RNA-specific adenosine deaminase (ADAR)-mediated adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing is a critical arm of the antiviral response. However, mechanistic insights into how A-to-I RNA editing affects viral infection are lacking. We posited that inosine incorporation into RNA facilitates sensing of nonself RNA by innate immune sensors and accordingly investigated the impact of inosine-modified RNA on Toll-like receptor 7 and 8 (TLR7/8) sensing. Inosine incorporation into synthetic single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) potentiated tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) or alpha interferon (IFN-α) production in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in a sequence-dependent manner, indicative of TLR7/8 recruitment. The effect of inosine incorporation on TLR7/8 sensing was restricted to immunostimulatory ssRNAs and was not seen with inosine-containing short double-stranded RNAs or with a deoxy-inosine-modified ssRNA. Inosine-mediated increase of self-secondary structure of an ssRNA resulted in potentiated IFN-α production in human PBMCs through TLR7 recruitment, as established through the use of a TLR7 antagonist and Tlr7-deficient cells. There was a correlation between hyperediting of influenza A viral ssRNA and its ability to stimulate TNF-α, independent of 5'-triphosphate residues, and involving Adar-1. Furthermore, A-to-I editing of viral ssRNA directly enhanced mouse Tlr7 sensing, when present in proportions reproducing biologically relevant levels of RNA editing. Thus, we demonstrate for the first time that inosine incorporation into immunostimulatory ssRNA can potentiate TLR7/8 activation. Our results suggest a novel function of A-to-I RNA editing, which is to facilitate TLR7/8 sensing of phagocytosed viral RNA.",2014 Jan,J Virol. 2014 Jan;88(2):799-810. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01571-13.

24485196,Alu elements shape the primate transcriptome by cis-regulation of RNA editing.,"BACKGROUND: RNA editing by adenosine to inosine deamination is a widespread phenomenon, particularly frequent in the human transcriptome, largely due to the presence of inverted Alu repeats and their ability to form double-stranded structures--a requisite for ADAR editing. While several hundred thousand editing sites have been identified within these primate-specific repeats, the function of Alu-editing has yet to be elucidated. RESULTS: We show that inverted Alu repeats, expressed in the primate brain, can induce site-selective editing in cis on sites located several hundred nucleotides from the Alu elements. Furthermore, a computational analysis, based on available RNA-seq data, finds that site-selective editing occurs significantly closer to edited Alu elements than expected. These targets are poorly edited upon deletion of the editing inducers, as well as in homologous transcripts from organisms lacking Alus. Sequences surrounding sites near edited Alus in UTRs, have been subjected to a lesser extent of evolutionary selection than those far from edited Alus, indicating that their editing generally depends on cis-acting Alus. Interestingly, we find an enrichment of primate-specific editing within encoded sequence or the UTRs of zinc finger-containing transcription factors. CONCLUSIONS: We propose a model whereby primate-specific editing is induced by adjacent Alu elements that function as recruitment elements for the ADAR editing enzymes. The enrichment of site-selective editing with potentially functional consequences on the expression of transcription factors indicates that editing contributes more profoundly to the transcriptomic regulation and repertoire in primates than previously thought.",2014 Feb 3,Genome Biol. 2014 Feb 3;15(2):R28. doi: 10.1186/gb-2014-15-2-r28.,"['Daniel C', 'Silberberg G', 'Behm M', 'Öhman M']",True

C. elegans have two ADAR proteins, ADR-2 and the theoretically catalytically inactive ADR-1. Using high-throughput RNA sequencing of wild-type and adr mutant worms, we expand the repertoire of C. elegans edited transcripts over 5-fold and confirm that ADR-2 is the only active deaminase in vivo. Despite lacking deaminase function, ADR-1 affects editing of over 60 adenosines within the 3' UTRs of 16 different mRNAs. Furthermore, ADR-1 interacts directly with ADR-2 substrates, even in the absence of ADR-2, and mutations within its double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) binding domains abolish both binding and editing regulation. We conclude that ADR-1 acts as a major regulator of editing by binding ADR-2 substrates in vivo.

In this study, we investigated the status and role of ADARs and altered A-to-I RNA editing in ESCC tumorigenesis. Among the three ADAR enzymes expressed in human cells, only ADAR1 was overexpressed in primary ESCC tumors. ADAR1 overexpression was due to gene amplification. Patients with ESCC with tumoral overexpression of ADAR1 displayed a poor prognosis. In vitro and in vivo functional assays established that ADAR1 functions as an oncogene during ESCC progression. Differential expression of ADAR1 resulted in altered gene-specific editing activities, as reflected by hyperediting of FLNB and AZIN1 messages in primary ESCC. Notably, the edited form of AZIN1 conferred a gain-of-function phenotype associated with aggressive tumor behavior. Our findings reveal that altered gene-specific A-to-I editing events mediated by ADAR1 drive the development of ESCC, with potential implications in diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of this disease.",2014 Feb 1,Cancer Res. 2014 Feb 1;74(3):840-51. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-13-2545.

24262145,A type I interferon signature identifies bilateral striatal necrosis due to mutations in ADAR1.,"BACKGROUND: We recently observed mutations in ADAR1 to cause a phenotype of bilateral striatal necrosis (BSN) in a child with the type I interferonopathy Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS). We therefore decided to screen patients with apparently non-syndromic BSN for ADAR1 mutations, and for an upregulation of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). METHODS: We performed Sanger sequencing of ADAR1 in a series of patients with BSN presenting to us during our routine clinical practice. We then undertook detailed clinical and neuroradiological phenotyping in nine mutation-positive children. We also measured the expression of ISGs in peripheral blood from these patients, and in children with BSN who did not have ADAR1 mutations. RESULTS: Nine ADAR1 mutation-positive patients from seven families demonstrated an acute (five cases) or subacute (four cases) onset of refractory, four-limb dystonia starting between 8 months and 5 years of age. Eight patients were developmentally normal at initial presentation. In seven cases, the disease was inherited as an autosomal recessive trait, while two related patients were found to have a heterozygous (dominant) ADAR1 mutation. All seven mutation-positive patients assayed showed an upregulation of ISGs (median: 12.50, IQR: 6.43-36.36) compared to controls (median: 0.93, IQR: 0.57-1.30), a so-called interferon signature, present many years after disease onset. No interferon signature was present in four children with BSN negative for mutations in ADAR1 (median: 0.63, IQR: 0.47-1.10). CONCLUSIONS: ADAR1-related disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis of apparently non-syndromic BSN with severe dystonia of varying evolution. The finding of an interferon signature provides a useful screening test for the presence of ADAR1 mutations in this context, and may suggest novel treatment approaches.",2014 Feb,J Med Genet. 2014 Feb;51(2):76-82. doi: 10.1136/jmedgenet-2013-102038.

Infection by HCMV is life threatening in immune compromised individuals and in immune competent individuals it can cause severe birth defects, developmental retardation and is even associated with tumor development. While numerous mechanisms were developed by HCMV to interfere with immune cell activity, much less is known about cellular mechanisms that operate in response to HCMV infection. Here we demonstrate that in response to HCMV infection, the expression of the short form of the RNA editing enzyme ADAR1 (ADAR1-p110) is induced. We identified the specific promoter region responsible for this induction and we show that ADAR1-p110 can edit miR-376a. Accordingly, we demonstrate that the levels of the edited-miR-376a (miR-376a(e)) increase during HCMV infection. Importantly, we show that miR-376a(e) downregulates the immune modulating molecule HLA-E and that this consequently renders HCMV infected cells susceptible to elimination by NK cells.",2014 Feb,PLoS Pathog. 2014 Feb 27;10(2):e1003963. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1003963. eCollection 2014 Feb.,"['Nachmani D', 'Zimmermann A', 'Oiknine Djian E', 'Weisblum Y', 'Livneh Y', 'Khanh Le VT', 'Galun E', 'Horejsi V', 'Isakov O', 'Shomron N', 'Wolf DG', 'Hengel H', 'Mandelboim O']",False

In a majority of affected individuals the pathogenesis remains undetermined. METHODS: We identified a series of patients with a phenotype of nonsyndromic spastic paraplegia in whom no diagnosis had been reached before exome sequencing. We measured the expression of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) in peripheral blood from these patients. RESULTS: Five patients from four families with previously unexplained spastic paraplegia were identified with mutations in either ADAR1 (one patient), IFIH1 (one patient), or RNASEH2B (three patients from two families). All patients were developmentally normal before the onset of features beginning in the second year of life. All patients remain of normal intellect. Four patients demonstrated normal neuroimaging, while a single patient had features of nonspecific dysmyelination. The patients with ADAR1 and IFIH1-related disease showed a robust interferon signature. The patients with mutations in RNASEH2B demonstrated no (two patients) or a minimal (one patient) upregulation of ISGs compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in ADAR1, IFIH1, and RNASEH2B can cause a phenotype of spastic paraplegia with normal neuroimaging, or in association with nonspecific dysmyelination. Although the presence of an interferon signature can be helpful in interpreting the significance of gene variants in this context, patients with pathogenic mutations in RNASEH2B may demonstrate no upregulation of ISGs in peripheral blood.

25158696,A genome-wide map of hyper-edited RNA reveals numerous new sites.,"Adenosine-to-inosine editing is one of the most frequent post-transcriptional modifications, manifested as A-to-G mismatches when comparing RNA sequences with their source DNA. Recently, a number of RNA-seq data sets have been screened for the presence of A-to-G editing, and hundreds of thousands of editing sites identified. Here we show that existing screens missed the majority of sites by ignoring reads with excessive ('hyper') editing that do not easily align to the genome. We show that careful alignment and examination of the unmapped reads in RNA-seq studies reveal numerous new sites, usually many more than originally discovered, and in precisely those regions that are most heavily edited. Specifically, we discover 327,096 new editing sites in the heavily studied Illumina Human BodyMap data and more than double the number of detected sites in several published screens. We also identify thousands of new sites in mouse, rat, opossum and fly.

However, although alkyne- and triazole-bearing ribonucleosides are in widespread use, very little information is available on the impact of these modifications on RNA structure. By solving crystal structures for RNA duplexes containing these analogues, we show that, like adenosine, 7-EAA and a triazole derived from 7-EAA base pair with uridine and are well-accommodated within an A-form helix. We show that copper-catalyzed azide/alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reactions with 7-EAA are sensitive to the RNA secondary structure context, with single-stranded sites reacting faster than duplex sites. 7-EAA and its triazole products are recognized in RNA template strands as adenosine by avian myoblastosis virus reverse transcriptase. In addition, 7-EAA in RNA is a substrate for an active site mutant of the RNA editing adenosine deaminase, ADAR2. These studies extend our understanding of the impact of these novel nucleobase analogues and set the stage for their use in probing RNA structure and metabolism.",2014 Aug 15,ACS Chem Biol. 2014 Aug 15;9(8):1780-7. doi: 10.1021/cb500270x.

Diabetic foot ulcers are the leading cause of nontraumatic lower limb amputations. A complex background of pathophysiologic events has been identified with advances in molecular biology such that newer interventions are possible. Bioengineered skin substitutes currently play an important role in the diabetic foot ulcer, particularly in the ""stalled"" wounds that fail to show progress in their healing trajectory. However, newer designs and scaffold incorporation may herald a new generation of products with more focused targeting of these pathophysiologic events. The major background impairment is that of vasculogenesis brought about as a direct result of hyperglycemia, advanced glycation end product/methylglyoxal generation, and its direct effect on endothelial progenitor cell production and attraction to the wound site. At the same time, glycation end products affect immunity and inflammation, increasing the susceptibility to infection. Thus, reactive oxygen species scavengers, methylglyoxal scavengers, vascular endothelial growth factor stimulators as well as various lipids and neuropeptides are all potential agents that could be incorporated into such templates. The logical sequence of events and possible interventions is detailed. In this manner, intrinsic healing is encouraged in preference to our current attempts at adding unknown quantities of specialized cellular and growth factor components which seem to provide very temporary advantages.",2014 Aug,Ann Plast Surg. 2014 Aug;73(2):239-44. doi: 10.1097/SAP.0b013e31826eac22.,['Widgerow AD'],False
24679603,Hippocampus-specific deficiency in RNA editing of GluA2 in Alzheimer's disease.,"Adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing is a base recoding process within precursor messenger RNA, catalyzed by members of the adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) family. A notable example occurs at the Q/R site of the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid glutamate receptor subunit GluA2. Abnormally, low editing at this site leads to excessive calcium influx and cell death. We studied hippocampus and caudate samples from Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and age-matched healthy controls, using direct sequencing and a high accuracy primer-extension technique to assess RNA editing at the Q/R GluA2 site. Both techniques revealed lower, more variable RNA editing in AD, specific to the hippocampus and the GluA2 site. Deficient editing also characterized the hippocampus of apolipoprotein ε4 allele carriers, regardless of clinical diagnosis. In AD, messenger RNA expression of neuronal markers was decreased in the hippocampus, and expression of the Q/R-site editing enzyme ADAR2 was decreased in caudate. These findings provide a link between neurodegenerative processes and deficient RNA editing of the GluA2 Q/R site, and may contribute to both diagnosis and treatment of AD.",2014 Aug,Neurobiol Aging. 2014 Aug;35(8):1785-91. doi: 10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2014.02.018.

24760760,Excessive production and extreme editing of human metapneumovirus defective interfering RNA is associated with type I IFN induction.,"Type I IFN production is one of the hallmarks of host innate immune responses upon virus infection. Whilst most respiratory viruses carry IFN antagonists, reports on human metapneumovirus (HMPV) have been conflicting. Using deep sequencing, we have demonstrated that HMPV particles accumulate excessive amounts of defective interfering RNA (DIs) rapidly upon in vitro passage, and that these are associated with IFN induction. Importantly, the DIs were edited extensively; up to 70% of the original A and T residues had mutated to G or C, respectively. Such high editing rates of viral RNA have not, to our knowledge, been reported before. Bioinformatics and PCR assays indicated that adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) was the most likely editing enzyme. HMPV thus has an unusually high propensity to generate DIs, which are edited at an unprecedented high frequency. The conflicting published data on HMPV IFN induction and antagonism are probably explained by DIs in virus stocks. The interaction of HMPV DIs with the RNA-editing machinery and IFN responses warrants further investigation.",2014 Aug,J Gen Virol. 2014 Aug;95(Pt 8):1625-1633. doi: 10.1099/vir.0.066100-0.

Pairs of inverted Alu repeats are found in a substantial number of human genes, and when transcribed, they form long double-stranded RNA structures that serve as optimal substrates for RNA editing enzymes. A small subset of edited Alu elements has been shown to exhibit diverse functional roles in the regulation of alternative splicing, miRNA repression, and cis-regulation of distant RNA editing sites.

25110019,"Conflict RNA modification, host-parasite co-evolution, and the origins of DNA and DNA-binding proteins1.","Nearly 150 different enzymatically modified forms of the four canonical residues in RNA have been identified. For instance, enzymes of the ADAR (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA) family convert adenosine residues into inosine in cellular dsRNAs. Recent findings show that DNA endonuclease V enzymes have undergone an evolutionary transition from cleaving 3' to deoxyinosine in DNA and ssDNA to cleaving 3' to inosine in dsRNA and ssRNA in humans. Recent work on dsRNA-binding domains of ADARs and other proteins also shows that a degree of sequence specificity is achieved by direct readout in the minor groove. However, the level of sequence specificity observed is much less than that of DNA major groove-binding helix-turn-helix proteins. We suggest that the evolution of DNA-binding proteins following the RNA to DNA genome transition represents the major advantage that DNA genomes have over RNA genomes. We propose that a hypothetical RNA modification, a RRAR (ribose reductase acting on genomic dsRNA) produced the first stretches of DNA in RNA genomes. We discuss why this is the most satisfactory explanation for the origin of DNA. The evolution of this RNA modification and later steps to DNA genomes are likely to have been driven by cellular genome co-evolution with viruses and intragenomic parasites.

24470146,The influence of CpG and UpA dinucleotide frequencies on RNA virus replication and characterization of the innate cellular pathways underlying virus attenuation and enhanced replication.,"Most RNA viruses infecting mammals and other vertebrates show profound suppression of CpG and UpA dinucleotide frequencies. To investigate this functionally, mutants of the picornavirus, echovirus 7 (E7), were constructed with altered CpG and UpA compositions in two 1.1-1.3 Kbase regions. Those with increased frequencies of CpG and UpA showed impaired replication kinetics and higher RNA/infectivity ratios compared with wild-type virus. Remarkably, mutants with CpGs and UpAs removed showed enhanced replication, larger plaques and rapidly outcompeted wild-type virus on co-infections. Luciferase-expressing E7 sub-genomic replicons with CpGs and UpAs removed from the reporter gene showed 100-fold greater luminescence. E7 and mutants were equivalently sensitive to exogenously added interferon-β, showed no evidence for differential recognition by ADAR1 or pattern recognition receptors RIG-I, MDA5 or PKR. However, kinase inhibitors roscovitine and C16 partially or entirely reversed the attenuated phenotype of high CpG and UpA mutants, potentially through inhibition of currently uncharacterized pattern recognition receptors that respond to RNA composition. Generating viruses with enhanced replication kinetics has applications in vaccine production and reporter gene construction. More fundamentally, the findings introduce a new evolutionary paradigm where dinucleotide composition of viral genomes is subjected to selection pressures independently of coding capacity and profoundly influences host-pathogen interactions.",2014 Apr,Nucleic Acids Res. 2014 Apr;42(7):4527-45. doi: 10.1093/nar/gku075.

These sequences represent 15 PIV5 strains, of which 6 were isolated from humans, 1 was from monkeys, 2 were from pigs, and 6 were from dogs. Strain diversity is remarkably low, regardless of host, year of isolation, or geographical origin; a total of 7.8% of nucleotides are variable, and the average pairwise difference between strains is 2.1%. Variation is distributed unevenly across the PIV5 genome, but no convincing evidence of selection for antibody-mediated evasion in hemagglutinin-neuraminidase was found. The finding that some canine and porcine, but not primate, strains are mutated in the SH gene, and do not produce SH, raised the possibility that dogs (or pigs) may not be the natural host of PIV5. The genetic stability of PIV5 was also demonstrated during serial passage of one strain (W3) in Vero cells at a high multiplicity of infection, under conditions of competition with large proportions of defective interfering genomes. A similar observation was made for a strain W3 mutant (PIV5VΔC) lacking V gene function, in which the dominant changes were related to pseudoreversion in this gene. The mutations detected in PIV5VΔC during pseudoreversion, and also those characterizing the SH gene in canine and porcine strains, predominantly involved U-to-C transitions. This suggests an important role for biased hypermutation via an adenosine deaminase, RNA-specific (ADAR)-like activity. IMPORTANCE: Here we report the sequence variation of 16 different isolates of parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5) that were isolated from a number of species, including humans, monkeys, dogs, and pigs, over 4 decades. Surprisingly, strain diversity was remarkably low, regardless of host, year of isolation, or geographical origin. Variation was distributed unevenly across the PIV5 genome, but no convincing evidence of immune or host selection was found. This overall genome stability of PIV5 was also observed when the virus was grown in the laboratory, and the genome stayed remarkably constant even during the selection of virus mutants. Some of the canine isolates had lost their ability to encode one of the viral proteins, termed SH, suggesting that although PIV5 commonly infects dogs, dogs may not be the natural host for PIV5.",2014 Apr,J Virol. 2014 Apr;88(7):3826-36. doi: 10.1128/JVI.03351-13.

24561617,ADAR mediates differential expression of polycistronic microRNAs.,"Adenosine deaminases acting on RNAs (ADARs) convert adenosine residues to inosines in primary microRNA (pri-miRNA) transcripts to alter the structural conformation of these precursors and the subsequent functions of the encoded microRNAs (miRNAs). Here we show that RNA editing by Drosophila ADAR modulates the expression of three co-transcribed miRNAs encoded by the evolutionarily conserved let-7-Complex (let-7-C) locus. For example, a single A-to-I change at the -6 residue of pri-miR-100, the first miRNA in this let-7-C polycistronic transcript, leads to enhanced miRNA processing by Drosha and consequently enhanced functional miR-100 both in vitro as well as in vivo. In contrast, other editing events, including one at the +43 residue of the pri-miR-125, destabilize the primary transcript and reduce the levels of all three encoded miRNAs. Consequently, loss of adar in vivo leads to reduced miR-100 but increased miR-125. In wild-type animals, the destabilizing editing events in pri-let-7-C increase during the larval-to-adult transition and are critical for the normal downregulation of all three miRNAs seen late in metamorphosis. These findings unravel a new regulatory role for ADAR and raise the possibility that ADAR mediates the differential expression characteristic of many polycistronic miRNA clusters.",2014 Apr,Nucleic Acids Res. 2014 Apr;42(8):5245-55. doi: 10.1093/nar/gku145.

24722121,RNA editome in rhesus macaque shaped by purifying selection.,"Understanding of the RNA editing process has been broadened considerably by the next generation sequencing technology; however, several issues regarding this regulatory step remain unresolved--the strategies to accurately delineate the editome, the mechanism by which its profile is maintained, and its evolutionary and functional relevance. Here we report an accurate and quantitative profile of the RNA editome for rhesus macaque, a close relative of human. By combining genome and transcriptome sequencing of multiple tissues from the same animal, we identified 31,250 editing sites, of which 99.8% are A-to-G transitions. We verified 96.6% of editing sites in coding regions and 97.5% of randomly selected sites in non-coding regions, as well as the corresponding levels of editing by multiple independent means, demonstrating the feasibility of our experimental paradigm. Several lines of evidence supported the notion that the adenosine deamination is associated with the macaque editome--A-to-G editing sites were flanked by sequences with the attributes of ADAR substrates, and both the sequence context and the expression profile of ADARs are relevant factors in determining the quantitative variance of RNA editing across different sites and tissue types. In support of the functional relevance of some of these editing sites, substitution valley of decreased divergence was detected around the editing site, suggesting the evolutionary constraint in maintaining some of these editing substrates with their double-stranded structure. These findings thus complement the ""continuous probing"" model that postulates tinkering-based origination of a small proportion of functional editing sites. In conclusion, the macaque editome reported here highlights RNA editing as a widespread functional regulation in primate evolution, and provides an informative framework for further understanding RNA editing in human.",2014 Apr,PLoS Genet. 2014 Apr 10;10(4):e1004274. doi: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1004274. eCollection 2014 Apr.,"['Chen JY', 'Peng Z', 'Zhang R', 'Yang XZ', 'Tan BC', 'Fang H', 'Liu CJ', 'Shi M', 'Ye ZQ', 'Zhang YE', 'Deng M', 'Zhang X', 'Li CY']",True

SG formation in ADAR1-sufficient cells infected with WT or V(ko) mutant virus was enhanced by IFN treatment and was PKR-dependent. SG formation in C(ko) virus-infected cells was already high without IFN treatment and was not further enhanced by IFN. IFN treatment alone, in the absence of infection, induced SG formation in ADAR1-deficient but not ADAR1-sufficient cells. Type I IFN-induced enhancement in SG formation occurred by a canonical IFN signaling response dependent upon STAT1 and STAT2.

24608178,Down-regulation of the RNA editing enzyme ADAR2 contributes to RGC death in a mouse model of glaucoma.,"Glaucoma is a progressive neurodegenerative disease of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) associated with characteristic axon degeneration in the optic nerve. Excitotoxic damage due to increased Ca(2+) influx, possibly through NMDA-type glutamate receptors, has been proposed to be a cause of RGC dysfunction and death in glaucoma. Recent work has found that expression of another potentially critical receptor, the Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptor (CP-AMPAR), is elevated during various pathological conditions (including ALS and ischemia), resulting in increased neuronal death. Here we test the hypothesis that CP-AMPARs contribute to RGC death due to elevated Ca(2+) influx in glaucoma. AMPA receptors are impermeable to Ca(2+) if the tetrameric receptor contains a GluA2 subunit that has undergone Q/R RNA editing at a site in the pore region. The activity of ADAR2, the enzyme responsible for this RNA editing, generally ensures that the vast majority of GluA2 proteins are edited. Here, we demonstrate that ADAR2 levels decrease in a mouse model of glaucoma in which IOP is chronically elevated. Furthermore, using an in vitro model of RGCs, we find that knockdown of ADAR2 using siRNA increased the accumulation of Co(2+) in response to glutamate, and decreased the rectification index of AMPA currents detected electrophysiologically, indicating an increased Ca(2+) permeability through AMPARs. The RGCs in primary culture also exhibited increased excitotoxic cell death following knock down of ADAR2. Furthermore, cell death was reversed by NASPM, a specific blocker for CP-AMPARs. Together, our data suggest that chronically elevated IOP in adult mice reduces expression of the ADAR2 enzyme, and the loss of ADAR2 editing and subsequent disruption of GluA2 RNA editing might potentially play a role in promoting RGC neuronal death as observed in glaucoma.",2014,PLoS One. 2014 Mar 7;9(3):e91288. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0091288. eCollection 2014.,"['Wang AL', 'Carroll RC', 'Nawy S']",False
24818983,Zebrafish Adar2 Edits the Q/R site of AMPA receptor Subunit gria2α transcript to ensure normal development of nervous system and cranial neural crest cells.,"BACKGROUND: Adar2 deaminates selective adenosines to inosines (A-to-I RNA editing) in the double-stranded region of nuclear transcripts. Although the functions of mouse Adar2 and its biologically most important substrate gria2, encoding the GluA2 subunit of AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid) receptor, have been extensively studied, the substrates and functions of zebrafish Adar2 remain elusive. METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Expression of Adar2 was perturbed in the adar2 morphant (adar2MO), generated by antisense morpholio oligonucleotides. The Q/R editing of gria2α was reduced in the adar2MO and was enhanced by overexpression of Adar2, demonstrating an evolutionarily conserved activity between zebrafish and mammalian Adar2 in editing the Q/R site of gria2. To delineate the role of Q/R editing of gria2α in the developmental defects observed in the adar2MO, the Q/R editing of gria2α was specifically perturbed in the gria2αQRMO, generated by a morpholio oligonucleotide complementary to the exon complementary sequence (ECS) required for the Q/R editing. Analogous to the adar2-deficient and Q/R-editing deficient mice displaying identical neurological defects, the gria2αQRMO and adar2MO displayed identical developmental defects in the nervous system and cranial cartilages. Knockdown p53 abolished apoptosis and partially suppressed the loss of spinal cord motor neurons in these morphants. However, reducing p53 activity neither replenished the brain neuronal populations nor rescued the developmental defects. The expressions of crestin and sox9b in the neural crest cells were reduced in the adar2MO and gria2αQRMO. Overexpressing the edited GluA2αR in the adar2MO restored normal expressions of cresting and sox9b. Moreover, overexpressing the unedited GluA2αQ in the wild type embryos resulted in reduction of crestin and sox9b expressions. These results argue that an elevated GluA2αQ level is sufficient for generating the cranial neural crest defects observed in the adar2MO. Our results present a link between dysfunction of AMPA receptors and defective development of the nervous system and cranial neural crest in the zebrafish.",2014,PLoS One. 2014 May 12;9(5):e97133. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0097133. eCollection 2014.,"['Li IC', 'Chen YC', 'Wang YY', 'Tzeng BW', 'Ou CW', 'Lau YY', 'Wu KM', 'Chan TM', 'Lin WH', 'Hwang SP', 'Chow WY']",False
25672733,[Calpain plays a crucial role in TDP-43 pathology].,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common adult-onset motor neuron disease affecting healthy middle-aged individuals. Mislocalization of TAR DNA binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) or TDP-43 pathology observed in the spinal motor neurons is the pathological hallmark of ALS. The mechanism generating TDP-43 pathology remained uncertain. Several reports suggested that cleavage of TDP-43 into aggregation-prone fragments might be the earliest event. Therefore, elucidation of the protease(s) that is responsible for TDP-43 cleavage in the motor neurons is awaited. ALS-specific molecular abnormalities other than TDP-43 pathology in the motor neurons of sporadic ALS patients include inefficient RNA editing at the GluA2 glutamine/arginine (Q/R) site, which is specifically catalyzed by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 2 (ADAR2). We have developed the conditional ADAR2 knockout (AR2) mice, in which the ADAR2 gene is targeted in motor neurons. We found that Ca(2+)-dependent cysteine protease calpain cleaved TDP-43 into aggregation-prone fragments, which initiated TDP-43 mislocalization in the motor neurons expressing abnormally abundant Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptors. Here we summarized the molecular cascade leading to TDP-43 pathology observed in the motor neurons of AR2 mice and discussed possible roles of dysregulation of calpain-dependent cleavage of TDP-43 in TDP-43 pathology observed in neurological diseases in general.",2014,Rinsho Shinkeigaku. 2014;54(12):1151-4. doi: 10.5692/clinicalneurol.54.1151.,"['Yamashita T', 'Kwak S']",True

Aside from this major function, recent examples of dsRBDs involved in the regulation of the sub-cellular localization of proteins, suggest that the participation of dsRBDs in nucleocytoplasmic trafficking is likely to represent a widespread auxiliary function of this type of RNA-binding domain. Overall, dsRBDs from proteins involved in many different biological processes have been reported to be implicated in nuclear import and export, as well as cytoplasmic, nuclear and nucleolar retention. Interestingly, the function of dsRBDs in nucleocytoplasmic trafficking is often regulated by their dsRNA-binding capacity, which can either enhance or impair the transport from one compartment to another.

25949793,Functional Impact of RNA editing and ADARs on regulation of gene expression: perspectives from deep sequencing studies.,"Cells regulate gene expression at multiple levels leading to a balance between robustness and complexity within their proteome. One core molecular step contributing to this important balance during metazoan gene expression is RNA editing, such as the co-transcriptional recoding of RNA transcripts catalyzed by the adenosine deaminse acting on RNA (ADAR) family of enzymes. Understanding of the adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing process has been broadened considerably by the next generation sequencing (NGS) technology, which allows for in-depth demarcation of an RNA editome at nucleotide resolution. However, critical issues remain unresolved with regard to how RNA editing cooperates with other transcript-associated events to underpin regulated gene expression. Here we review the growing body of evidence, provided by recent NGS-based studies, that links RNA editing to other mechanisms of post-transcriptional RNA processing and gene expression regulation including alternative splicing, transcript stability and localization, and the biogenesis and function of microRNAs (miRNAs). We also discuss the possibility that systematic integration of NGS data may be employed to establish the rules of an ""RNA editing code"", which may give us new insights into the functional consequences of RNA editing.",2014,Cell Biosci. 2014 Aug 19;4:44. doi: 10.1186/2045-3701-4-44. eCollection 2014.,"['Liu H', 'Ma CP', 'Chen YT', 'Schuyler SC', 'Chang KP', 'Tan BC']",True

In this paper, we propose a method that makes link predictions in co-authorship networks, where topological features between authors such as Adamic/Adar, Common Neighbors, Jaccard's Coefficient, Preferential Attachment, Katzβ, and PropFlow may be good indicators of their future collaborations. Firstly, these topological features were systematically extracted from the network. Then, supervised models were used to learn the best weights associated with different topological features in deciding co-author relationships. Finally, we tested our models on the co-authorship networks in the research field of Coronary Artery Disease and obtained encouraging accuracy (the precision, recall, F1 score and AUC were, respectively, 0.696, 0.677, 0.671 and 0.742 for Logistic Regression, and respectively, 0.697, 0.678, 0.671 and 0.743 for SVM).

IFN-γ induced ADAR1 expression in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) but not T cells. ADAR1 siRNA knockdown induced HIV-1 expression in BAL cells of four HIV-1 infected patients on antiretroviral therapy. Similar results were obtained in MDM that were HIV-1 infected in vitro. Over-expression of ADAR1 in transformed macrophages inhibited HIV-1 viral replication but not viral transcription measured by nuclear run-on, suggesting that ADAR1 acts post-transcriptionally. The A to G hyper-mutation pattern observed in ADAR1 over-expressing cells in vitro was similar to that found in the lungs of HIV-1 infected patients treated with aerosol IFN-γ suggesting the model accurately represented alveolar macrophages. Together, these results indicate that ADAR1 restricts HIV-1 replication post-transcriptionally in macrophages harboring HIV-1 provirus.

25396741,Detection theory in identification of RNA-DNA sequence differences using RNA-sequencing.,"Advances in sequencing technology have allowed for detailed analyses of the transcriptome at single-nucleotide resolution, facilitating the study of RNA editing or sequence differences between RNA and DNA genome-wide. In humans, two types of post-transcriptional RNA editing processes are known to occur: A-to-I deamination by ADAR and C-to-U deamination by APOBEC1. In addition to these sequence differences, researchers have reported the existence of all 12 types of RNA-DNA sequence differences (RDDs); however, the validity of these claims is debated, as many studies claim that technical artifacts account for the majority of these non-canonical sequence differences. In this study, we used a detection theory approach to evaluate the performance of RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) and associated aligners in accurately identifying RNA-DNA sequence differences. By generating simulated RNA-Seq datasets containing RDDs, we assessed the effect of alignment artifacts and sequencing error on the sensitivity and false discovery rate of RDD detection. Overall, we found that even in the presence of sequencing errors, false negative and false discovery rates of RDD detection can be contained below 10% with relatively lenient thresholds. We also assessed the ability of various filters to target false positive RDDs and found them to be effective in discriminating between true and false positives. Lastly, we used the optimal thresholds we identified from our simulated analyses to identify RDDs in a human lymphoblastoid cell line. We found approximately 6,000 RDDs, the majority of which are A-to-G edits and likely to be mediated by ADAR. Moreover, we found the majority of non A-to-G RDDs to be associated with poorer alignments and conclude from these results that the evidence for widespread non-canonical RDDs in humans is weak. Overall, we found RNA-Seq to be a powerful technique for surveying RDDs genome-wide when coupled with the appropriate thresholds and filters.",2014,PLoS One. 2014 Nov 14;9(11):e112040. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0112040. eCollection 2014.,"['Toung JM', 'Lahens N', 'Hogenesch JB', 'Grant G']",False
25692240,Positive correlation between ADAR expression and its targets suggests a complex regulation mediated by RNA editing in the human brain.,"A-to-I RNA editing by adenosine deaminases acting on RNA is a post-transcriptional modification that is crucial for normal life and development in vertebrates. RNA editing has been shown to be very abundant in the human transcriptome, specifically at the primate-specific Alu elements. The functional role of this wide-spread effect is still not clear; it is believed that editing of transcripts is a mechanism for their down-regulation via processes such as nuclear retention or RNA degradation. Here we combine 2 neural gene expression datasets with genome-level editing information to examine the relation between the expression of ADAR genes with the expression of their target genes. Specifically, we computed the spatial correlation across structures of post-mortem human brains between ADAR and a large set of targets that were found to be edited in their Alu repeats. Surprisingly, we found that a large fraction of the edited genes are positively correlated with ADAR, opposing the assumption that editing would reduce expression. When considering the correlations between ADAR and its targets over development, 2 gene subsets emerge, positively correlated and negatively correlated with ADAR expression. Specifically, in embryonic time points, ADAR is positively correlated with many genes related to RNA processing and regulation of gene expression. These findings imply that the suggested mechanism of regulation of expression by editing is probably not a global one; ADAR expression does not have a genome wide effect reducing the expression of editing targets. It is possible, however, that RNA editing by ADAR in non-coding regions of the gene might be a part of a more complex expression regulation mechanism.",2014,RNA Biol. 2014;11(11):1447-56. doi: 10.4161/15476286.2014.992286.,"['Liscovitch N', 'Bazak L', 'Levanon EY', 'Chechik G']",True
23742890,A truncated Danio rerio PKZ isoform functionally interacts with eIF2α and inhibits protein synthesis.,"A protein kinase containing Z-DNA binding domains (PKZ), which resembles protein kinase R (PKR) in domain organization, was recently discovered to be a member of the eIF2α kinase family in fish. PKR has roles in antiviral immunity through inhibiting protein synthesis and activating NF-κB; therefore, it is thought that PKZ may have a similar role in fish antiviral immunity. In the present study, the roles of two Danio rerio PKZ isoforms (DrPKZ-A and DrPKZ-B) in eIF2α phosphorylation and protein synthesis regulation were explored. DrPKZ-A and DrPKZ-B possess N-terminal Z-DNA binding domains and a conserved eIF2α kinase domain; however, they have domains of differing lengths inserted between kinase subdomains IV and V. DrPKZ-A has an insert domain of 73 amino acids (aa), whereas DrPKZ-B has an insert sequence of only 10 aa, suggesting that DrPKZ-B could be a dysfunctional isoform or could interact with different substrates. Our results show that both DrPKZ-A and DrPKZ-B functionally interact with eIF2α and inhibit protein synthesis, although DrPKZ-B possesses attenuated kinase activity. Our results also show that deletion of the insert in either isoform results in the complete abrogation of kinase activity, suggesting that the insert is critical for PKZ kinase activity. Kinase activity appears to be independent of insert length but may depend on the presence of specific amino acids within the insert domain. Furthermore, the effects of the N-terminal regulatory domain on kinase activity were analyzed. Deletion of the N-terminus results in reduced kinase activity of these isoforms relative to the wild-type forms, indicating that the isolated kinase domain is sufficient for eIF2α phosphorylation and that DrPKZ-A and DrPKZ-B may be regulated in a similar manner. Overall, our results show that DrPKZ-B is a functional kinase in zebrafish and contribute to our understanding of the function of PKZ in fish.",2013 Sep 15,Gene. 2013 Sep 15;527(1):292-300. doi: 10.1016/j.gene.2013.05.043.

24020926,"The PKR activator, PACT, becomes a PKR inhibitor during HIV-1 replication.","BACKGROUND: HIV-1 translation is modulated by the activation of the interferon (IFN)-inducible Protein Kinase RNA-activated (PKR). PKR phosphorylates its downstream targets, including the alpha subunit of the eukaryotic translation Initiation Factor 2 (eIF2α), which decreases viral replication. The PKR Activator (PACT) is known to activate PKR after a cellular stress. In lymphocytic cell lines, HIV-1 activates PKR only transiently and not when cells replicate the virus at high levels. The regulation of this activation is due to a combination of viral and cellular factors that have been only partially identified. RESULTS: PKR is transiently induced and activated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells after HIV-1 infection. The addition of IFN reduces viral replication, and induces both the production and phosphorylation of PKR. In lymphocytic Jurkat cells infected by HIV-1, a multiprotein complex around PKR contains the double-stranded RNA binding proteins (dsRBPs), adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR)1 and PACT. In HEK 293T cells transfected with an HIV-1 molecular clone, PACT unexpectedly inhibited PKR and eIF2α phosphorylation and increased HIV-1 protein expression and virion production in the presence of either endogenous PKR alone or overexpressed PKR. The comparison between different dsRBPs showed that ADAR1, TAR RNA Binding Protein (TRBP) and PACT inhibit PKR and eIF2α phosphorylation in HIV-infected cells, whereas Staufen1 did not. Individual or a combination of short hairpin RNAs against PACT or ADAR1 decreased HIV-1 protein expression. In the astrocytic cell line U251MG, which weakly expresses TRBP, PACT mediated an increased HIV-1 protein expression and a decreased PKR phosphorylation. In these cells, a truncated PACT, which constitutively activates PKR in non-infected cells showed no activity on either PKR or HIV-1 protein expression. Finally, PACT and ADAR1 interact with each other in the absence of RNAs. CONCLUSION: In contrast to its previously described activity, PACT contributes to PKR dephosphorylation during HIV-1 replication. This activity is in addition to its heterodimer formation with TRBP and could be due to its binding to ADAR1. HIV-1 has evolved to replicate in cells with high levels of TRBP, to induce the expression of ADAR1 and to change the function of PACT for PKR inhibition and increased replication.",2013 Sep 11,Retrovirology. 2013 Sep 11;10:96. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-10-96.,"['Clerzius G', 'Shaw E', 'Daher A', 'Burugu S', 'Gélinas JF', 'Ear T', 'Sinck L', 'Routy JP', 'Mouland AJ', 'Patel RC', 'Gatignol A']",True

Mutations in the adenosine deaminase acting on RNA1 (ADAR1) gene have been revealed as the cause of DSH. ADAR1 is known to give rise to two protein isoforms (p150 and p110) that differ by the 295 N-terminal amino acids, but the specific roles of its two isoforms in the pathogenesis of DSH are poorly understood. OBJECTIVES: A Chinese family with typical DSH was screened for mutation of ADAR1, and we aimed to investigate the functional significance of the identified mutation. METHODS: All exons and adjacent exon-intron sequences were amplified and sequenced. The possible influence of the identified mutation on the functionality of p150 and p110 was analysed using the minigene strategy and dual-luciferase reporter assay, respectively. RESULTS: We identified a novel two-base-pair deletion of AG (c.271_272delAG) in exon 2 of ADAR1. The AG deletion caused a frameshift mutation in the p150 isoform, and the mutant p150 transcripts were subjected to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. However, the deletion mutation did not alter the encoded amino acid sequence of the p110 protein due its position in the 5'-untranslated region of the p110 isoform, and had no significant influence on the expression of p110.

In this study, we found that injection of nucleic acid mimics poly(I:C), poly(C:G), CL097, poly C and CpG-DNA, afforded shrimp antiviral immunity, which is similar to the vertebrate IFN system. Using suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) method, 480 expression sequence tags were identified to be involved in the poly(I:C)-induced antiviral immunity of the model crustacean Litopenaeus vannamei, and 41% of them were new genes.

A previous study screening for heat tolerance in Drosophila mutants discovered a hypnos-2 mutant strain that was later found to be defective in dADAR, the Drosophila gene encoding the A-to-I editing enzyme. This supports the hypothesis that cells and organisms respond to stressful environments by ADAR (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA)-mediated RNA editing. Here, we investigated changes in the RNA A-to-I editing frequencies of 30 Drosophila nervous system targets in response to heat shock, a stress acclimatization that requires the dADAR function.

24099082,pKa shifting in double-stranded RNA is highly dependent upon nearest neighbors and bulge positioning.,"Shifting of pKa's in RNA is important for many biological processes; however, the driving forces responsible for shifting are not well understood. Herein, we determine how structural environments surrounding protonated bases affect pKa shifting in double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Using (31)P NMR, we determined the pKa of the adenine in an A(+)·C base pair in various sequence and structural environments. We found a significant dependence of pKa on the base pairing strength of nearest neighbors and the location of a nearby bulge. Increasing nearest neighbor base pairing strength shifted the pKa of the adenine in an A(+)·C base pair higher by an additional 1.6 pKa units, from 6.5 to 8.1, which is well above neutrality. The addition of a bulge two base pairs away from a protonated A(+)·C base pair shifted the pKa by only ~0.5 units less than a perfectly base paired hairpin; however, positioning the bulge just one base pair away from the A(+)·C base pair prohibited formation of the protonated base pair as well as several flanking base pairs. Comparison of data collected at 25 °C and 100 mM KCl to biological temperature and Mg(2+) concentration revealed only slight pKa changes, suggesting that similar sequence contexts in biological systems have the potential to be protonated at biological pH.

24008387,ADAR-mediated RNA editing in non-coding RNA sequences.,"Adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing is the most abundant editing event in animals. It converts adenosine to inosine in double-stranded RNA regions through the action of the adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) proteins. Editing of pre-mRNA coding regions can alter the protein codon and increase functional diversity. However, most of the A-to-I editing sites occur in the non-coding regions of pre-mRNA or mRNA and non-coding RNAs. Untranslated regions (UTRs) and introns are located in pre-mRNA non-coding regions, thus A-to-I editing can influence gene expression by nuclear retention, degradation, alternative splicing, and translation regulation. Non-coding RNAs such as microRNA (miRNA), small interfering RNA (siRNA) and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) are related to pre-mRNA splicing, translation, and gene regulation. A-to-I editing could therefore affect the stability, biogenesis, and target recognition of non-coding RNAs. Finally, it may influence the function of non-coding RNAs, resulting in regulation of gene expression. This review focuses on the function of ADAR-mediated RNA editing on mRNA non-coding regions (UTRs and introns) and non-coding RNAs (miRNA, siRNA, and lncRNA).",2013 Oct,Sci China Life Sci. 2013 Oct;56(10):944-52. doi: 10.1007/s11427-013-4546-5.

24025532,Spatio-temporal profiling of Filamin A RNA-editing reveals ADAR preferences and high editing levels outside neuronal tissues.,"RNA editing by ADARs can change the coding potential of protein-coding mRNAs. So far, this type of RNA editing has mainly been shown to affect RNAs expressed in the nervous system with much lower editing levels being observed in other tissues. The actin crosslinking proteins filamin α and filamin β are widely expressed in most tissues. The mRNAs encoding either protein are edited at the same position leading to a conserved Q to R exchange in both proteins. Using bar-coded next generation sequencing, we show that editing of filamin α is most abundant in the gastrointestinal tract and only to a lesser extent in the nervous system. Using knockout mice, we show that ADARB1 (ADAR2) is responsible for the majority of FLNA editing, while ADAR1 can edit filamin α mRNA in some tissues quite efficiently. Interestingly, editing levels of filamin α and β do not follow the same trend across tissues, suggesting a substrate-specific regulation of editing.",2013 Oct,RNA Biol. 2013 Oct;10(10):1611-7. doi: 10.4161/rna.26216.

Genetic studies have identified pathogenic mutations in the double-stranded RNA-specific adenosine deaminase (DSRAD) gene as responsible for this disorder. OBJECTIVES: To identify additional gene mutations of DSRAD in patients with DSH. METHODS: Two Chinese families with typical DSH were subjected to mutation detection in DSRAD. All DSRAD exons and their flanking intronic sequences were amplified and sequenced. RESULTS: Two novel mutations in the functional domains of the DSRAD gene were identified in two pedigrees. The c. 3140G>A(p.G1047D) mutation was found in all patients but not in the healthy individuals from the same family (I) and c.1760 A>G(p.Y587C) mutation was found in all the patients but not in the healthy family members (II).

Since Inosine is read as Guanosine, the biological consequence of ADAR enzyme activity is an A/G conversion within RNA molecules. A-to-I editing events can occur on both coding and non-coding RNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs), which are small regulatory RNAs of ~20-23 nucleotides that regulate several cell processes by annealing to target mRNAs and inhibiting their translation. Both miRNA precursors and mature miRNAs undergo A-to-I RNA editing, affecting the miRNA maturation process and activity. ADARs can also edit 3' UTR of mRNAs, further increasing the interplay between mRNA targets and miRNAs. In this review, we provide a general overview of the ADAR enzymes and their mechanisms of action as well as miRNA processing and function.

24124932,RNA-Seq analysis identifies a novel set of editing substrates for human ADAR2 present in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.,"ADAR2 is a member of a family of RNA editing enzymes found in metazoa that bind double helical RNAs and deaminate select adenosines. We find that when human ADAR2 is overexpressed in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae it substantially reduces the rate of cell growth. This effect is dependent on the deaminase activity of the enzyme, suggesting yeast transcripts are edited by ADAR2. Characterization of this novel set of RNA substrates provided a unique opportunity to gain insight into ADAR2's site selectivity. We used RNA-Seq. to identify transcripts present in S. cerevisiae subject to ADAR2-catalyzed editing. From this analysis, we identified 17 adenosines present in yeast RNAs that satisfied our criteria for candidate editing sites. Substrates identified include both coding and noncoding RNAs. Subsequent Sanger sequencing of RT-PCR products from yeast total RNA confirmed efficient editing at a subset of the candidate sites including BDF2 mRNA, RL28 intron RNA, HAC1 3'UTR RNA, 25S rRNA, U1 snRNA, and U2 snRNA. Two adenosines within the U1 snRNA sequence not identified as substrates during the original RNA-Seq. screen were shown to be deaminated by ADAR2 during the follow-up analysis. In addition, examination of the RNA sequence surrounding each edited adenosine in this novel group of ADAR2 sites revealed a previously unrecognized sequence preference. Remarkably, rapid deamination at one of these sites (BDF2 mRNA) does not require ADAR2's dsRNA-binding domains (dsRBDs). Human glioma-associated oncogene 1 (GLI1) mRNA is a known ADAR2 substrate with similar flanking sequence and secondary structure to the yeast BDF2 site discovered here. As observed with the BDF2 site, rapid deamination at the GLI1 site does not require ADAR2's dsRBDs.",2013 Nov 12,Biochemistry. 2013 Nov 12;52(45):7857-69. doi: 10.1021/bi4006539.

Failure of GluA2 RNA editing resulting from downregulation of the RNA-editing enzyme adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 2 (ADAR2) occurs in the majority of ALS cases and causes the death of motor neurons via a Ca(2+) -permeable AMPA receptor-mediated mechanism. Here, we explored the possibility of gene therapy for ALS by upregulating ADAR2 in mouse motor neurons using an adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) vector that provides gene delivery to a wide array of central neurons after peripheral administration. A single intravenous injection of AAV9-ADAR2 in conditional ADAR2 knockout mice (AR2), which comprise a mechanistic mouse model of sporadic ALS, caused expression of exogenous ADAR2 in the central neurons and effectively prevented progressive motor dysfunction. Notably, AAV9-ADAR2 rescued the motor neurons of AR2 mice from death by normalizing TDP-43 expression. This AAV9-mediated ADAR2 gene delivery may therefore enable the development of a gene therapy for ALS.",2013 Nov,EMBO Mol Med. 2013 Nov;5(11):1710-9. doi: 10.1002/emmm.201302935.

23744109,Aicardi-Goutières syndrome: clues from the RNase H2 knock-out mouse.,"Ribonuclease H2 (RNase H2) belongs to the family of RNase H enzymes, which process RNA/DNA hybrids. Apart from cleaving the RNA moiety of a plain RNA/DNA hybrid, RNase H2 participates in the removal of single ribonucleotides embedded in a DNA duplex. Mutations in RNase H2 lead to the chronic inflammatory disorder Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS), which has significant phenotypic overlaps with the autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosus. RNase H2 knock-out mice are embryonic lethal. Mouse embryos lacking RNase H2 accumulate DNA damage and exhibit a p53-mediated growth arrest commencing at gastrulation. On a molecular level, the knock-out mice reveal that RNase H2 represents an essential DNA repair enzyme, whose main cellular function is the removal of accidentally misincorporated ribonucleotides from genomic DNA. Ribonucleotides strongly accumulate within the genomic DNA of RNase H2-deficient cells, in turn resulting in a massive build-up of DNA damage in these cells. The DNA lesions that arise from misincorporated ribonucleotides constitute the by far most frequent type of naturally occurring DNA damage. AGS-causing mutations have also been found in the genes of the 3'-exonuclease TREX1, the dNTP triphosphatase SAMHD1, as well as the RNA-editing enzyme ADAR1, defining defects in nucleic acid metabolism pathways as a common hallmark of AGS pathology. However, recent evidence gathered from RNase H2 knock-out mice might provide additional insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying AGS development and a potential role of DNA damage as a trigger of autoimmunity is discussed.",2013 Nov,J Mol Med (Berl). 2013 Nov;91(11):1235-40. doi: 10.1007/s00109-013-1061-x.

23975196,Structural basis for Z-DNA binding and stabilization by the zebrafish Z-DNA dependent protein kinase PKZ.,"The RNA-dependent protein kinase PKR plays a central role in the antiviral defense of vertebrates by shutting down protein translation upon detection of viral dsRNA in the cytoplasm. In some teleost fish, PKZ, a homolog of PKR, performs the same function, but surprisingly, instead of dsRNA binding domains, it harbors two Z-DNA/Z-RNA-binding domains belonging to the Zalpha domain family. Zalpha domains have also been found in other proteins, which have key roles in the regulation of interferon responses such as ADAR1 and DNA-dependent activator of IFN-regulatory factors (DAI) and in viral proteins involved in immune response evasion such as the poxviral E3L and the Cyprinid Herpesvirus 3 ORF112. The underlying mechanism of nucleic acids binding and stabilization by Zalpha domains is still unclear. Here, we present two crystal structures of the zebrafish PKZ Zalpha domain (DrZalpha(PKZ)) in alternatively organized complexes with a (CG)6 DNA oligonucleotide at 2 and 1.8 Å resolution.

24067935,ADAR1 regulates ARHGAP26 gene expression through RNA editing by disrupting miR-30b-3p and miR-573 binding.,"Rho GTPase activating protein 26 (ARHGAP26) is a negative regulator of the Rho family that converts the small G proteins RhoA and Cdc42 to their inactive GDP-bound forms. It is essential for the CLIC/GEEC endocytic pathway, cell spreading, and muscle development. The present study shows that ARHGAP26 mRNA undergoes extensive A-to-I RNA editing in the 3' UTR that is specifically catalyzed by ADAR1. Furthermore, the mRNA and protein levels of ARHGAP26 were decreased in cells in which ADAR1 was knocked down. Conversely, ADAR1 overexpression increased the abundance of ARHGAP26 mRNA and protein. In addition, we found that both miR-30b-3p and miR-573 target the ARHGAP26 gene and that RNA editing of ARHGAP26 mediated by ADAR1 abolished the repression of its expression by miR-30b-3p or miR-573. When ADAR1 was overexpressed, the reduced abundance of ARHGAP26 protein mediated by miR-30b-3p or miR-573 was rescued. Importantly, we also found that knocking down ADAR1 elevated RhoA activity, which was consistent with the reduced level of ARHGAP26. Conversely, when ADAR1 was overexpressed, the amount of RhoA-GTP decreased. The similar expression patterns of ARHGAP26 and ADAR1 in human tissue samples further confirmed our findings. Taken together, our results suggest that ADAR1 regulates the expression of ARHGAP26 through A-to-I RNA editing by disrupting the binding of miR-30b-3p and miR-573 within the 3' UTR of ARHGAP26.

23982513,Proteins that contain a functional Z-DNA-binding domain localize to cytoplasmic stress granules.,"Long double-stranded RNA may undergo hyper-editing by adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADARs), where up to 50% of adenosine residues may be converted to inosine. However, although numerous RNAs may undergo hyper-editing, the role for inosine-containing hyper-edited double-stranded RNA in cells is poorly understood. Nevertheless, editing plays a critical role in mammalian cells, as highlighted by the analysis of ADAR-null mutants. In particular, the long form of ADAR1 (ADAR1(p150)) is essential for viability. Moreover, a number of studies have implicated ADAR1(p150) in various stress pathways. We have previously shown that ADAR1(p150) localized to cytoplasmic stress granules in HeLa cells following either oxidative or interferon-induced stress. Here, we show that the Z-DNA-binding domain (Zα(ADAR1)) exclusively found in ADAR1(p150) is required for its localization to stress granules. Moreover, we show that fusion of Zα(ADAR1) to either green fluorescent protein (GFP) or polypyrimidine binding protein 4 (PTB4) also results in their localization to stress granules. We additionally show that the Zα domain from other Z-DNA-binding proteins (ZBP1, E3L) is likewise sufficient for localization to stress granules. Finally, we show that Z-RNA or Z-DNA binding is important for stress granule localization.

23697632,ADAR2 editing activity in newly diagnosed versus relapsed pediatric high-grade astrocytomas.,"BACKGROUND: High-grade (WHO grade III and IV) astrocytomas are aggressive malignant brain tumors affecting humans with a high risk of recurrence in both children and adults. To date, limited information is available on the genetic and molecular alterations important in the onset and progression of pediatric high-grade astrocytomas and, even less, on the prognostic factors that influence long-term outcome in children with recurrence. A-to-I RNA editing is an essential post-transcriptional mechanism that can alter the nucleotide sequence of several RNAs and is mediated by the ADAR enzymes. ADAR2 editing activity is particularly important in mammalian brain and is impaired in both adult and pediatric high-grade astrocytomas. Moreover, we have recently shown that the recovered ADAR2 activity in high-grade astrocytomas inhibits in vivo tumor growth. The aim of the present study is to investigate whether changes may occur in ADAR2-mediated RNA editing profiles of relapsed high-grade astrocytomas compared to their respective specimens collected at diagnosis, in four pediatric patients. METHODS: Total RNAs extracted from all tumor samples and controls were tested for RNA editing levels (by direct sequencing on cDNA pools) and for ADAR2 mRNA expression (by qRT-PCR). RESULTS: A significant loss of ADAR2-editing activity was observed in the newly diagnosed and recurrent astrocytomas in comparison to normal brain. Surprisingly, we found a substantial rescue of ADAR2 editing activity in the relapsed tumor of the only patient showing prolonged survival. CONCLUSIONS: High-grade astrocytomas display a generalized loss of ADAR2-mediated RNA editing at both diagnosis and relapse. However, a peculiar Case, in complete remission of disease, displayed a total rescue of RNA editing at relapse, intriguingly suggesting ADAR2 activity/expression as a possible marker for long-term survival of patients with high-grade astrocytomas.",2013 May 22,BMC Cancer. 2013 May 22;13:255. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-13-255.,"['Tomaselli S', 'Galeano F', 'Massimi L', 'Di Rocco C', 'Lauriola L', 'Mastronuzzi A', 'Locatelli F', 'Gallo A']",True

Here, we report the dynamics of adenosine-to-inosine editing in miRNA precursors and their selected elimination during mouse preimplantation development. Adar1p110 and Snd1 were found to be strongly but differentially expressed in oocytes and zygotes with respect to later pre-implantation stages. When the biogenesis of miR-151 was assessed, the majority of miR-151 precursors was edited and subsequently eliminated during early development. Deep sequencing of this and other miRNAs confirmed that, in general, edited precursors were selectively eliminated at early post-zygotic stages. Moreover, in oocytes and throughout the zygote-to-blastocyst stages, Tudor-SN accumulated in newly discovered aggregates termed 'T bodies'.

Its symptoms are mixed hyper- and hypopigmented macules on the dorsal aspect of the hands and feet and freckle-like macules on the face. The gene responsible for DSH has been identified as adenosine deaminase acting on RNA1 (ADAR1).

However, its function in the skin and role in the development of DSH are still unknown. To date, more than 100 mutations of ADAR1 have been reported in patients with DSH, and the catalytic domain deaminase is believed to be crucial to the activities of this gene.

23474544,Global regulation of alternative splicing by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR).,"Alternative mRNA splicing is a major mechanism for gene regulation and transcriptome diversity. Despite the extent of the phenomenon, the regulation and specificity of the splicing machinery are only partially understood. Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing of pre-mRNA by ADAR enzymes has been linked to splicing regulation in several cases. Here we used bioinformatics approaches, RNA-seq and exon-specific microarray of ADAR knockdown cells to globally examine how ADAR and its A-to-I RNA editing activity influence alternative mRNA splicing. Although A-to-I RNA editing only rarely targets canonical splicing acceptor, donor, and branch sites, it was found to affect splicing regulatory elements (SREs) within exons. Cassette exons were found to be significantly enriched with A-to-I RNA editing sites compared with constitutive exons. RNA-seq and exon-specific microarray revealed that ADAR knockdown in hepatocarcinoma and myelogenous leukemia cell lines leads to global changes in gene expression, with hundreds of genes changing their splicing patterns in both cell lines. This global change in splicing pattern cannot be explained by putative editing sites alone. Genes showing significant changes in their splicing pattern are frequently involved in RNA processing and splicing activity. Analysis of recently published RNA-seq data from glioblastoma cell lines showed similar results. Our global analysis reveals that ADAR plays a major role in splicing regulation. Although direct editing of the splicing motifs does occur, we suggest it is not likely to be the primary mechanism for ADAR-mediated regulation of alternative splicing.

23537002,Prediction of constitutive A-to-I editing sites from human transcriptomes in the absence of genomic sequences.,"BACKGROUND: Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing is recognized as a cellular mechanism for generating both RNA and protein diversity. Inosine base pairs with cytidine during reverse transcription and therefore appears as guanosine during sequencing of cDNA. Current approaches of RNA editing identification largely depend on the comparison between transcriptomes and genomic DNA (gDNA) sequencing datasets from the same individuals, and it has been challenging to identify editing candidates from transcriptomes in the absence of gDNA information. RESULTS: We have developed a new strategy to accurately predict constitutive RNA editing sites from publicly available human RNA-seq datasets in the absence of relevant genomic sequences. Our approach establishes new parameters to increase the ability to map mismatches and to minimize sequencing/mapping errors and unreported genome variations. We identified 695 novel constitutive A-to-I editing sites that appear in clusters (named ""editing boxes"") in multiple samples and which exhibit spatial and dynamic regulation across human tissues. Some of these editing boxes are enriched in non-repetitive regions lacking inverted repeat structures and contain an extremely high conversion frequency of As to Is. We validated a number of editing boxes in multiple human cell lines and confirmed that ADAR1 is responsible for the observed promiscuous editing events in non-repetitive regions, further expanding our knowledge of the catalytic substrate of A-to-I RNA editing by ADAR enzymes. CONCLUSIONS: The approach we present here provides a novel way of identifying A-to-I RNA editing events by analyzing only RNA-seq datasets. This method has allowed us to gain new insights into RNA editing and should also aid in the identification of more constitutive A-to-I editing sites from additional transcriptomes.",2013 Mar 27,BMC Genomics. 2013 Mar 27;14:206. doi: 10.1186/1471-2164-14-206.,"['Zhu S', 'Xiang JF', 'Chen T', 'Chen LL', 'Yang L']",True
23728176,MicroRNA-mediated loss of ADAR1 in metastatic melanoma promotes tumor growth.,"Some solid tumors have reduced posttranscriptional RNA editing by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) enzymes, but the functional significance of this alteration has been unclear. Here, we found the primary RNA-editing enzyme ADAR1 is frequently reduced in metastatic melanomas. In situ analysis of melanoma samples using progression tissue microarrays indicated a substantial downregulation of ADAR1 during the metastatic transition. Further, ADAR1 knockdown altered cell morphology, promoted in vitro proliferation, and markedly enhanced the tumorigenicity in vivo. A comparative whole genome expression microarray analysis revealed that ADAR1 controls the expression of more than 100 microRNAs (miRNAs) that regulate many genes associated with the observed phenotypes. Importantly, we discovered that ADAR1 fundamentally regulates miRNA processing in an RNA binding–dependent, yet RNA editing–independent manner by regulating Dicer expression at the translational level via let-7. In addition, ADAR1 formed a complex with DGCR8 that was mutually exclusive with the DGCR8-Drosha complex that processes pri-miRNAs in the nucleus. We found that cancer cells silence ADAR1 by overexpressing miR-17 and miR-432, which both directly target the ADAR1 transcript. We further demonstrated that the genes encoding miR-17 and miR-432 are frequently amplified in melanoma and that aberrant hypomethylation of the imprinted DLK1-DIO3 region in chromosome 14 can also drive miR-432 overexpression.",2013 Jun,J Clin Invest. 2013 Jun;123(6):2703-18. doi: 10.1172/JCI62980.,"['Nemlich Y', 'Greenberg E', 'Ortenberg R', 'Besser MJ', 'Barshack I', 'Jacob-Hirsch J', 'Jacoby E', 'Eyal E', 'Rivkin L', 'Prieto VG', 'Chakravarti N', 'Duncan LM', 'Kallenberg DM', 'Galun E', 'Bennett DC', 'Amariglio N', 'Bar-Eli M', 'Schachter J', 'Rechavi G', 'Markel G']",True
23609948,Genetic markers associated with early cancer-specific mortality following prostatectomy.,"BACKGROUND: This study sought to identify novel effectors and markers of localized but potentially life-threatening prostate cancer (PCa), by evaluating chromosomal copy number alterations (CNAs) in tumors from patients who underwent prostatectomy and correlating these with clinicopathologic features and outcome. METHODS: CNAs in tumor DNA samples from 125 patients in the discovery cohort who underwent prostatectomy were assayed with high-resolution Affymetrix 6.0 single-nucleotide polymorphism microarrays and then analyzed using the Genomic Identification of Significant Targets in Cancer (GISTIC) algorithm. RESULTS: The assays revealed 20 significant regions of CNAs, 4 of them novel, and identified the target genes of 4 of the alterations. By univariate analysis, 7 CNAs were significantly associated with early PCa-specific mortality. These included gains of chromosomal regions that contain the genes MYC, ADAR, or TPD52 and losses of sequences that incorporate SERPINB5, USP10, PTEN, or TP53. On multivariate analysis, only the CNAs of PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) and MYC (v-myc myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog) contributed additional prognostic information independent of that provided by pathologic stage, Gleason score, and initial prostate-specific antigen level. Patients whose tumors had alterations of both genes had a markedly elevated risk of PCa-specific mortality (odds ratio = 53; 95% CI = 6.92-405, P = 1 × 10(-4)). Analyses of 333 tumors from 3 additional distinct patient cohorts confirmed the relationship between CNAs of PTEN and MYC and lethal PCa. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified new CNAs and genes that likely contribute to the pathogenesis of localized PCa and suggests that patients whose tumors have acquired CNAs of PTEN, MYC, or both have an increased risk of early PCa-specific mortality.",2013 Jul 1,Cancer. 2013 Jul 1;119(13):2405-12. doi: 10.1002/cncr.27954.

The growth inhibitory capacity of some analogues against Jurkat T cells as well as prostate carcinoma (PC-3) and chronic myelogenous leukemia (K562) cells, which contain elevated basal IKK activity, correlates with the induction of apoptosis and increased inhibition of recombinant IKKα and IKKβ in vitro, pointing toward inhibition of IKK/NFκB signaling as the most likely target of the anticancer activities of these AdArs. While the chalcone functional group present in many dietary compounds has been shown to mediate interactions with IKKβ via Michael addition with cysteine residues, AdArs containing a five-membered heterocyclic ring (isoxazoles and pyrazoles) in place of the chalcone of the parent system are potent inhibitors of IKKs as well, which suggests that other mechanisms for inhibition exist that do not depend on the presence of a reactive α,β-unsaturated ketone.",2013 Jul,ChemMedChem. 2013 Jul;8(7):1184-98. doi: 10.1002/cmdc.201300100.

We performed a mutation analysis of the ADAR1 gene in 2 Chinese families with DSH and reviewed all articles published regarding ADAR1 mutations reported since 2003 by using PubMed. By direct sequencing, a 2-nucleotide AG deletion, 2099-2100delAG, was found in family 1, and a C→T mutation was identified at nucleotide 1420 that changed codon 474 from arginine to a translational termination codon in family 2. Two different pathogenic mutations were identified, c.2099-2100delAG and c.1420C>T, the former being a novel mutation, and the latter previously reported in 3 other families with DSH. To date, a total of 110 mutations in the ADAR1 gene have been reported, and 10 of them were recurrent; the mutations R474X, R1083C, R1096X, and R1155W might be the DSH-related hotspots.",2013 Jan 4,Genet Mol Res. 2013 Jan 4;12(3):2794-9. doi: 10.4238/2013.January.4.18.,"['Zhang GL', 'Shi HJ', 'Shao MH', 'Li M', 'Mu HJ', 'Gu Y', 'Du XF', 'Xie P']",True
23123729,ADAR1 ablation decreases bone mass by impairing osteoblast function in mice.,"Bone mass is controlled through a delicate balance between osteoblast-mediated bone formation and osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. We show here that RNA editing enzyme adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) is critical for proper control of bone mass. Postnatal conditional knockout of Adar1 (the gene encoding ADAR1) resulted in a severe osteopenic phenotype. Ablation of the Adar1 gene significantly suppressed osteoblast differentiation without affecting osteoclast differentiation in bone. In vitro deletion of the Adar1 gene decreased expression of osteoblast-specific osteocalcin and bone sialoprotein genes, alkaline phosphatase activity, and mineralization, suggesting a direct intrinsic role of ADAR1 in osteoblasts. ADAR1 regulates osteoblast differentiation by, at least in part, modulation of osterix expression, which is essential for bone formation. Further, ablation of the Adar1 gene decreased the proliferation and survival of bone marrow stromal cells and inhibited the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells towards osteoblast lineage. Finally, shRNA knockdown of the Adar1 gene in MC-4 pre-osteoblasts reduced cyclin D1 and cyclin A1 expression and cell growth. Our results identify ADAR1 as a new key regulator of bone mass and suggest that ADAR1 functions in this process mainly through modulation of the intrinsic properties of osteoblasts (i.e., proliferation, survival and differentiation).",2013 Jan 15,Gene. 2013 Jan 15;513(1):101-10. doi: 10.1016/j.gene.2012.10.068.

23275297,ADAR1 promotes malignant progenitor reprogramming in chronic myeloid leukemia.,"The molecular etiology of human progenitor reprogramming into self-renewing leukemia stem cells (LSC) has remained elusive. Although DNA sequencing has uncovered spliceosome gene mutations that promote alternative splicing and portend leukemic transformation, isoform diversity also may be generated by RNA editing mediated by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) enzymes that regulate stem cell maintenance. In this study, whole-transcriptome sequencing of normal, chronic phase, and serially transplantable blast crisis chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) progenitors revealed increased IFN-γ pathway gene expression in concert with BCR-ABL amplification, enhanced expression of the IFN-responsive ADAR1 p150 isoform, and a propensity for increased adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing during CML progression. Lentiviral overexpression experiments demonstrate that ADAR1 p150 promotes expression of the myeloid transcription factor PU.1 and induces malignant reprogramming of myeloid progenitors. Moreover, enforced ADAR1 p150 expression was associated with production of a misspliced form of GSK3β implicated in LSC self-renewal. Finally, functional serial transplantation and shRNA studies demonstrate that ADAR1 knockdown impaired in vivo self-renewal capacity of blast crisis CML progenitors. Together these data provide a compelling rationale for developing ADAR1-based LSC detection and eradication strategies.",2013 Jan 15,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2013 Jan 15;110(3):1041-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1213021110.

23209284,ADAR1 protein induces adenosine-targeted DNA mutations in senescent Bcl6 gene-deficient cells.,"Somatic mutations accumulate in senescent cells. Bcl6, which functions as a transcriptional repressor, has been identified as a potent inhibitor of cell senescence, but a role of Bcl6 in the accumulation of somatic mutations has remained unclear. Ig class-switch recombination simultaneously induces somatic mutations in an IgM class-switch (Ig-Sμ) region of IgG B cells. Surprisingly, mutations were detected in the Ig-Sμ region of Bcl6-deficient IgM B cells without class-switch recombination, and these mutations were mainly generated by conversion of adenosine to guanosine, suggesting a novel DNA mutator in the B cells. The ADAR1 (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA1) gene was overexpressed in Bcl6-deficient cells, and its promoter analysis revealed that ADAR1 is a molecular target of Bcl6. Exogenous ADAR1 induced adenosine-targeted DNA mutations in IgM B cells from ADAR1-transgenic mice and in wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). These mutations accumulated in senescent MEFs accompanied with endogenous ADAR1 expression, and the frequency in senescent Bcl6-deficient MEFs was higher than senescent wild-type MEFs. Thus, Bcl6 protects senescent cells from accumulation of adenosine-targeted DNA mutations induced by ADAR1.",2013 Jan 11,J Biol Chem. 2013 Jan 11;288(2):826-36. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M112.365718.

23172290,Activity-regulated RNA editing in select neuronal subfields in hippocampus.,"RNA editing by adensosine deaminases is a widespread mechanism to alter genetic information in metazoa. In addition to modifications in non-coding regions, editing contributes to diversification of protein function, in analogy to alternative splicing. However, although splicing programs respond to external signals, facilitating fine tuning and homeostasis of cellular functions, a similar regulation has not been described for RNA editing. Here, we show that the AMPA receptor R/G editing site is dynamically regulated in the hippocampus in response to activity. These changes are bi-directional, reversible and correlate with levels of the editase Adar2. This regulation is observed in the CA1 hippocampal subfield but not in CA3 and is thus subfield/celltype-specific. Moreover, alternative splicing of the flip/flop cassette downstream of the R/G site is closely linked to the editing state, which is regulated by Ca(2+). Our data show that A-to-I RNA editing has the capacity to tune protein function in response to external stimuli.",2013 Jan,Nucleic Acids Res. 2013 Jan;41(2):1124-34. doi: 10.1093/nar/gks1045.

23115276,Stress granule formation induced by measles virus is protein kinase PKR dependent and impaired by RNA adenosine deaminase ADAR1.,"ADAR1, an interferon (IFN)-inducible double-stranded (ds) RNA-specific adenosine deaminase, downregulates host innate responses, including activation of the dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) and induction of IFN-β mRNA. Conversely, PKR amplifies IFN-β induction by measles virus (MV) and inhibits virus protein synthesis. Formation of stress granules (SGs), cytoplasmic aggregates of stalled translation complexes and RNA-binding proteins, is a host response to virus infection mediated by translation initiation factor eIF2α phosphorylation. We examined the roles of PKR and ADAR1 in SG formation using HeLa cells stably deficient in either PKR (PKR(kd)) or ADAR1 (ADAR1(kd)) compared to control (CON(kd)) cells. Infection with either wild-type (WT) MV or an isogenic mutant lacking C protein expression (C(ko)) comparably induced formation of SG in ADAR1(kd) cells, whereas only the C(ko) mutant was an efficient inducer in control cells. Both ADAR1 and PKR colocalized with SG following infection. MV-induced; SG formation was PKR dependent but impaired by ADAR1. Complementation of ADAR1(kd) cells by expression of either p150 WT isoform or the p150 Zα (Y177A) Z-DNA-binding mutant of ADAR1 restored suppression of host responses, including SG formation and PKR activation. In contrast, neither the p110 WT isoform nor the p150 catalytic (H910A, E912A) mutant of ADAR1 complemented the ADAR1(kd) phenotype. These results further establish ADAR1 as a suppressor of host innate responses, including activation of PKR and the subsequent SG response.",2013 Jan,J Virol. 2013 Jan;87(2):756-66. doi: 10.1128/JVI.02270-12.

23127996,Adar is essential for optimal presynaptic function.,"RNA editing is a powerful way to recode genetic information. Because it potentially affects RNA targets that are predominantly present in neurons, it is widely hypothesized to affect neuronal structure and physiology. Across phyla, loss of the enzyme responsible for RNA editing, Adar, leads to behavioral changes, impaired locomotion, neurodegeneration and death. However, the consequences of a loss of Adar activity on neuronal structure and function have not been studied in detail. In particular, the role of RNA editing on synaptic development and physiology has not been investigated. Here we test the physiological and morphological consequences of the lack of Adar activity on the Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Our detailed examination of synaptic transmission showed that loss of Adar increases quantal size, reduces the number of quanta of neurotransmitter released and perturbs the calcium dependence of synaptic release. In addition, we find that staining for several synaptic vesicle proteins is abnormally intense at Adar deficient synapses. Consistent with this finding, Adar mutants showed a major alteration in synaptic ultrastructure. Finally, we present evidence of compensatory changes in muscle membrane properties in response to the changes in presynaptic activity within the Adar mutant NMJs.",2013 Jan,Mol Cell Neurosci. 2013 Jan;52:173-80. doi: 10.1016/j.mcn.2012.10.009.

22525274,ADAR2-editing activity inhibits glioblastoma growth through the modulation of the CDC14B/Skp2/p21/p27 axis.,"Grade IV astrocytoma or glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is one of the most aggressive and lethal tumors affecting humans. ADAR2-mediated A-to-I RNA editing, an essential post-transcriptional modification event in brain, is impaired in GBMs and astrocytoma cell lines. However, the role of ADAR2 editing in astrocytomas remains to be defined. Here, we show that ADAR2 editing rescue in astrocytomas prevents tumor growth in vivo and modulates an important cell cycle pathway involving the Skp2/p21/p27 proteins, often altered in glioblastoma. We demonstrate that ADAR2 deaminase activity is essential to inhibit tumor growth. Indeed, we identify the phosphatase CDC14B, which acts upstream of the Skp2/p21/p27 pathway, as a novel and critical ADAR2 target gene involved in glioblastoma growth. Specifically, ADAR2-mediated editing on CDC14B pre-mRNA increases its expression with a consequent reduction of the Skp2 target protein, as shown both in vitro and in vivo. We found that, compared to normal brain, both CDC14B editing and expression are progressively impaired in astrocytomas from grade I to IV, being very low in GBMs. These findings (1) demonstrate that post-transcriptional A-to-I RNA editing might be crucial for glioblastoma pathogenesis, (2) identify ADAR2-editing enzyme as a novel candidate tumor suppressor gene and (3) provide proof of principle that ADAR2 or its substrates may represent a suitable target(s) for possible novel, more effective and less toxic approaches to the treatment of GBMs.",2013 Feb 21,Oncogene. 2013 Feb 21;32(8):998-1009. doi: 10.1038/onc.2012.125.

23275536,RNA-interacting proteins act as site-specific repressors of ADAR2-mediated RNA editing and fluctuate upon neuronal stimulation.,"RNA editing by adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADARs) diversifies the transcriptome by changing adenosines to inosines. In mammals, editing levels vary in different tissues, during development, and also in pathogenic conditions. From a screen for repressors of editing we have isolated three proteins that repress ADAR2-mediated RNA editing. The three proteins RPS14, SFRS9 and DDX15 interact with RNA. Overexpression or depletion of these proteins can decrease or increase editing levels by 15%, thus allowing a modulation of RNA editing up to 30%. Interestingly, the three proteins alter RNA editing in a substrate-specific manner that correlates with their RNA binding preferences. In mammalian cells, SFRS9 significantly affects editing of the two substrates CFLAR and cyFIP2, while the ribosomal protein RPS14 mostly inhibits editing of cyFIP2 messenger RNA. The helicase DDX15, in turn, has a strong effect on editing in Caenorhabditis elegans. Expression of the three factors decreases during mouse brain development. Moreover, expression levels of SFRS9 and DDX15 respond strongly to neuronal stimulation or repression, showing an inverse correlation with editing levels. Colocalization and immunoprecipitation studies demonstrate a direct interaction of SFRS9 and RPS14 with ADAR2, while DDX15 associates with other helicases and splicing factors. Our data show that different editing sites can be specifically altered in their editing pattern by changing the local RNP landscape.",2013 Feb 1,Nucleic Acids Res. 2013 Feb 1;41(4):2581-93. doi: 10.1093/nar/gks1353.

23291631,Recoding RNA editing of AZIN1 predisposes to hepatocellular carcinoma.,"A better understanding of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) pathogenesis at the molecular level will facilitate the discovery of tumor-initiating events. Transcriptome sequencing revealed that adenosine-to-inosine (A→I) RNA editing of AZIN1 (encoding antizyme inhibitor 1) is increased in HCC specimens. A→I editing of AZIN1 transcripts, specifically regulated by ADAR1 (encoding adenosine deaminase acting on RNA-1), results in a serine-to-glycine substitution at residue 367 of AZIN1, located in β-strand 15 (β15) and predicted to cause a conformational change, induced a cytoplasmic-to-nuclear translocation and conferred gain-of-function phenotypes that were manifested by augmented tumor-initiating potential and more aggressive behavior. Compared with wild-type AZIN1 protein, the edited form has a stronger affinity to antizyme, and the resultant higher AZIN1 protein stability promotes cell proliferation through the neutralization of antizyme-mediated degradation of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and cyclin D1 (CCND1).

23324600,RNA editing of the GLI1 transcription factor modulates the output of Hedgehog signaling.,"The Hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway has important roles in tumorigenesis and in embryonal patterning. The Glioma-associated oncogene 1 (GLI1) is a key molecule in HH signaling, acting as a transcriptional effector and, moreover, is considered to be a potential therapeutic target for several types of cancer. To extend our previous focus on the implications of alternative splicing for HH signal transduction, we now report on an additional post-transcriptional mechanism with an impact on GLI1 activity, namely RNA editing. The GLI1 mRNA is highly edited at nucleotide 2179 by adenosine deamination in normal cerebellum, but the extent of this modification is reduced in cell lines from the cerebellar tumor medulloblastoma. Additionally, basal cell carcinoma tumor samples exhibit decreased GLI1 editing compared with normal skin. Interestingly, knocking down of either ADAR1 or ADAR2 reduces RNA editing of GLI1. This adenosine to inosine substitution leads to a change from Arginine to Glycine at position 701 that influences not only GLI1 transcriptional activity, but also GLI1-dependent cellular proliferation. Specifically, the edited GLI1, GLI1-701G, has a higher capacity to activate most of the transcriptional targets tested and is less susceptible to inhibition by the negative regulator of HH signaling suppressor of fused. However, the Dyrk1a kinase, implicated in cellular proliferation, is more effective in increasing the transcriptional activity of the non-edited GLI1. Finally, introduction of GLI1-701G into medulloblastoma cells confers a smaller increase in cellular growth relative to GLI1. In conclusion, our findings indicate that RNA editing of GLI1 is a regulatory mechanism that modulates the output of the HH signaling pathway.",2013 Feb,RNA Biol. 2013 Feb;10(2):321-33. doi: 10.4161/rna.23343.

23334429,NMR investigation on the DNA binding and B-Z transition pathway of the Zα domain of human ADAR1.,"Human ADAR1, which has two left-handed Z-DNA binding domains, preferentially binds Z-DNA rather than B-DNA with a high binding affinity. Z-DNA can be induced in long genomic DNA by Z-DNA binding proteins through the formation of two B-Z junctions with the extrusion of one base pair from each junction. We performed NMR experiments on complexes of Zα(ADAR1) with three DNA duplexes at a variety of protein-to-DNA molar ratios. This study confirmed that the Zα(ADAR1) first binds to an 8-bp CG-rich DNA segment via a unique conformation during B-Z transition and the neighboring AT-rich region becomes destabilized. We also found that, when DNA duplexes have only 6-bp CG-rich segment, the interaction with Zα(ADAR1) did not affect the thermal stabilities of the 6-bp CG-rich segment as well as the neighboring two A·T base pairs. These results indicate that four Zα(ADAR1) proteins interact with the 8-bp DNA sequence containing a 6-bp CG-repeat segment as well as a dinucleotide step, even though the dinucleotid step contains A∙T base pairs. Thus this study suggests that the length of the CG-rich region is more important than the specific DNA sequence for determining which base-pair is extruded from the B-Z junction structure. This study also found that the Zα(ADAR1) in complex with a 11-bp DNA duplex exhibits a Z-DNA-bound conformation distinct from that of free Zα(ADAR1) and the initial contact conformations of Zα(ADAR1) complexed with 13-bp DNA duplexes.",2013 Feb,Biophys Chem. 2013 Feb;172:18-25. doi: 10.1016/j.bpc.2012.12.002.

Here we report a method to systematically analyze RNA A-to-I editing targets by combining I-specific cleavage and exon array analysis.

Indeed, a number of genome-wide analyses have shown that A > I editing is not limited to a few mRNAs, as originally thought, but occurs widely across the transcriptome, especially in the brain. Importantly, there is increasing evidence that A > I editing is essential for animal development and nervous system function. To more efficiently characterize the complete catalog of ADAR events in the mammalian transcriptome we developed a high-throughput protocol to identify A > I editing sites, which exploits the capacity of glyoxal to protect guanosine, but not inosine, from RNAse T1 treatment, thus facilitating extraction of RNA fragments with inosine bases at their termini for high-throughput sequencing. Using this method we identified 665 editing sites in mouse brain RNA, including most known sites and suite of novel sites that include nonsynonymous changes to protein-coding genes, hyperediting of genes known to regulate p53, and alterations to non-protein-coding RNAs. This method is applicable to any biological system for the de novo discovery of A > I editing sites, and avoids the complicated informatic and practical issues associated with editing site identification using traditional RNA sequencing data.

23353575,A high-throughput screen to identify enhancers of ADAR-mediated RNA-editing.,"Adenosine to inosine deamination of RNA is widespread in metazoa. Inosines are recognized as guanosines and, therefore, this RNA-editing can influence the coding potential, localization and stability of RNAs. Therefore, RNA editing contributes to the diversification of the transcriptome in a flexible manner. The editing reaction is performed by adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADARs), which are essential for normal life and development in many organisms. Changes in editing levels are observed during development but also in neurological pathologies like schizophrenia, depression or tumors. Frequently, changes in editing levels are not reflected by changes in ADAR levels suggesting a regulation of enzyme activity. Until now, only a few factors are known that influence the activity of ADARs. Here we present a two-stage in vivo editing screen aimed to isolate enhancers of editing. A primary, high-throughput yeast-screen is combined with a more accurate secondary screen in mammalian cells that uses a fluorescent read-out to detect minor differences in RNA-editing. The screen was successfully employed to identify DSS1/SHFM1, the RNA binding protein hnRNP A2/B1 and a 3' UTR as enhancers of editing. By varying intracellular DSS1/SHFM1 levels, we can modulate A to I editing by up to 30%. Proteomic analysis indicates an interaction of DSS1/SHFM1 and hnRNP A2/B1 suggesting that both factors may act by altering the cellular RNP landscape. An extension of this screen to cDNAs from different tissues or developmental stages may prove useful for the identification of additional enhancers of RNA-editing.",2013 Feb,RNA Biol. 2013 Feb;10(2):192-204. doi: 10.4161/rna.23208.

24147578,Glutamate drugs and pharmacogenetics of OCD: a pathway-based exploratory approach.,"INTRODUCTION: Neuropharmacology research in glutamate-modulating drugs supports their development and use in the management of neuropsychiatric disorders, including major depression, Alzheimer's disorder and schizophrenia. Concomitantly, there is a growing use of these agents used in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). AREAS COVERED: This article provides a review of glutamate-modulating drugs used in the treatment of OCD. Specifically, the authors examine riluzole, N-acetylcysteine, d-cycloserine, glycine, ketamine, memantine and acamprosate as treatments. Furthermore, recent genetic epidemiology research findings are presented with a focus on the positional candidate genes SLC1A1 (a glutamate transporter), ADAR3 (an RNA-editing enzyme), RYR3 (a Ca(2+) channel), PBX1 (a homeobox transcription factor) and a GWAS candidate gene, DLGAP1 (a protein interacting with post-synaptic density). These genetic findings are submitted to a curated bioinformatics database to conform a biological network for discerning potential pharmacological targets. EXPERT OPINION: In the genetically informed network, known genes and identified key connecting components, including DLG4 (a developmental gene), PSD-95 (a synaptic scaffolding protein) and PSEN1 (presenilin, a regulator of secretase), conform a group of potential pharmacological targets. These potential targets can be explored, in the future, to deliver new therapeutic approaches to OCD. There is also the need to develop a better understanding of neuroprotective mechanisms as a foundation for future OCD drug discovery.",2013 Dec,Expert Opin Drug Discov. 2013 Dec;8(12):1515-27. doi: 10.1517/17460441.2013.845553.

22404657,Serotonin 2c receptor RNA editing in major depression and suicide.,"OBJECTIVES: mRNA for serotonin 2C receptor (5-HT(2C)R) undergoes editing which results in numerous isoforms. More highly edited isoforms exhibit decreased function. We recently found greater 5-HT(2C)R editing in suicide victims with prior bipolar disorder (BPD) or schizophrenia (SZ) compared with non-suicide patients and normal controls (NC). This study compares suicides and non-suicides with major depressive disorder (MDD(Suic) and MDD(NoSuic)) and non-suicide NC. METHODS: mRNA editing was assessed in prefrontal cortex of 24 MDD(Suic), 21 MDD(NoSuic), and 56 NC using next generation sequencing. mRNA expression of 5-HT(2C)R and editing enzymes (ADAR1-2) was assessed by real-time PCR. RESULTS: Editing was lower in MDD(NoSuic) than in MDD(Suic), which did not differ from NC. No differences in the 5-HT(2C)R or ADAR1 expression were detected. ADAR2 expression was higher in NC than in MDD subjects, but did not differ between MDD(NoSuic) and MDD(Suic). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest the presence of two factors associated with 5-HT(2C)R editing. One factor, which probably stems from decreased ADAR2 expression, is linked to MDD and is associated with less editing. The other, seen also in our previous study of suicide in BP and SZ, is linked to suicide alone and is associated with more editing and, therefore, less receptor function.",2013 Dec,World J Biol Psychiatry. 2013 Dec;14(8):590-601. doi: 10.3109/15622975.2011.630406.

23962477,microRNA control of interferons and interferon induced anti-viral activity.,"Interferons (IFNs) are cytokines that are spontaneously produced in response to virus infection. They act by binding to IFN-receptors (IFN-R), which trigger JAK/STAT cell signalling and the subsequent induction of hundreds of IFN-inducible genes, including both protein-coding and microRNA genes. IFN-induced genes then act synergistically to prevent virus replication and create an anti-viral state. miRNA are therefore integral to the innate response to virus infection and are important components of IFN-mediated biology. On the other hand viruses also encode miRNAs that in some cases interfere directly with the IFN response to infection. This review summarizes the important roles of miRNAs in virus infection acting both as IFN-stimulated anti-viral molecules and as critical regulators of IFNs and IFN-stimulated genes. It also highlights how recent knowledge in RNA editing influence miRNA control of virus infection.",2013 Dec,Mol Immunol. 2013 Dec;56(4):781-93. doi: 10.1016/j.molimm.2013.07.009.

24183309,"Assessment of interferon-related biomarkers in Aicardi-Goutières syndrome associated with mutations in TREX1, RNASEH2A, RNASEH2B, RNASEH2C, SAMHD1, and ADAR: a case-control study.","BACKGROUND: Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS) is an inflammatory disorder caused by mutations in any of six genes (TREX1, RNASEH2A, RNASEH2B, RNASEH2C, SAMHD1, and ADAR). The disease is severe and effective treatments are urgently needed. We investigated the status of interferon-related biomarkers in patients with AGS with a view to future use in diagnosis and clinical trials. METHODS: In this case-control study, samples were collected prospectively from patients with mutation-proven AGS. The expression of six interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) was measured by quantitative PCR, and the median fold change, when compared with the median of healthy controls, was used to create an interferon score for each patient. Scores higher than the mean of controls plus two SD (>2·466) were designated as positive. Additionally, we collated historical data for interferon activity, measured with a viral cytopathic assay, in CSF and serum from mutation-positive patients with AGS. We also undertook neutralisation assays of interferon activity in serum, and looked for the presence of autoantibodies against a panel of interferon proteins. FINDINGS: 74 (90%) of 82 patients had a positive interferon score (median 12·90, IQR 6·14-20·41) compared with two (7%) of 29 controls (median 0·93, IQR 0·57-1·30). Of the eight patients with a negative interferon score, seven had mutations in RNASEH2B (seven [27%] of all 26 patients with mutations in this gene). Repeat sampling in 16 patients was consistent for the presence or absence of an interferon signature on 39 of 41 occasions. Interferon activity (tested in 147 patients) was negatively correlated with age (CSF, r=-0·604; serum, r=-0·289), and was higher in CSF than in serum in 104 of 136 paired samples. Neutralisation assays suggested that measurable antiviral activity was related to interferon α production. We did not record significantly increased concentrations of autoantibodies to interferon subtypes in patients with AGS, or an association between the presence of autoantibodies and interferon score or serum interferon activity. INTERPRETATION: AGS is consistently associated with an interferon signature, which is apparently sustained over time and can thus be used to differentiate patients with AGS from controls. If future studies show that interferon status is a reactive biomarker, the measurement of an interferon score might prove useful in the assessment of treatment efficacy in clinical trials.

23534823,ADAR-related activation of adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing during regeneration.,"Urodele amphibians possess an amazing regenerative capacity that requires the activation of cellular plasticity in differentiated cells and progenitor/stem cells. Many aspects of regeneration in Urodele amphibians recapitulate development, making it unlikely that gene regulatory pathways which are essential for development are mutually exclusive from those necessary for regeneration. One such post-transcriptional gene regulatory pathway, which has been previously shown to be essential for functional metazoan development, is RNA editing. RNA editing catalyses discrete nucleotide changes in RNA transcripts, creating a molecular diversity that could create an enticing connection to the activated cellular plasticity found in newts during regeneration. To assess whether RNA editing occurs during regeneration, we demonstrated that GABRA3 and ADAR2 mRNA transcripts are edited in uninjured and regenerating tissues. Full open-reading frame sequences for ADAR1 and ADAR2, two enzymes responsible for adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing, were cloned from newt brain cDNA and exhibited a strong resemblance to ADAR (adenosine deaminase, RNA-specific) enzymes discovered in mammals. We demonstrated that ADAR1 and ADAR2 mRNA expression levels are differentially expressed during different phases of regeneration in multiple tissues, whereas protein expression levels remain unaltered. In addition, we have characterized a fascinating nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of ADAR1 in a variety of different cell types during regeneration, which could provide a mechanism for controlling RNA editing, without altering translational output of the editing enzyme. The link between RNA editing and regeneration provides further insights into how lower organisms, such as the newt, can activate essential molecular pathways via the discrete alteration of RNA sequences.",2013 Aug 15,Stem Cells Dev. 2013 Aug 15;22(16):2254-67. doi: 10.1089/scd.2013.0104.

The DSH locus was mapped to chromosome 1q11-q12 and, subsequently, pathogenic mutations in the double-stranded RNA-specific adenosine deaminase (ADAR1) gene were identified. We performed a mutational analysis of the ADAR1 gene in a Chinese family that included three individuals affected with typical DSH phenotypes. Mutations within the entire coding region and the exon-intron boundaries of ADAR1 were detected and confirmed by polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing, respectively. An insertion mutation within exon 12, c.3035_3036insC (p.P1012fsX1017), was identified in all family members affected by DSH, but not in the healthy members or 100 unrelated controls.

Here, we provide molecular, biochemical, and cellular evidence for the pathogenicity of two synonymous variants in RNASEH2A. Firstly, the c.69G>A (p.Val23Val) mutation causes the formation of a splice donor site within exon 1, resulting in an out of frame deletion at the end of exon 1, leading to reduced RNase H2 protein levels. The second mutation, c.75C>T (p.Arg25Arg), also introduces a splice donor site within exon 1, and the internal deletion of 18 amino acids. The truncated protein still forms a heterotrimeric RNase H2 complex, but lacks catalytic activity. However, as a likely result of leaky splicing, a small amount of full-length active protein is apparently produced in an individual homozygous for this mutation.

23949595,Antagonistic and stimulative roles of ADAR1 in RNA silencing.,"Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) are involved in RNA editing that converts adenosine residues to inosine specifically in double-stranded RNAs (dsRNA). This A-to-I RNA editing pathway and the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway seem to interact antagonistically by competing for their common dsRNA substrates. For instance, A-to-I editing of certain microRNA (miRNA) precursors by ADAR1 and ADAR2 inhibits their processing to mature miRNAs. Recent studies unexpectedly revealed the presence of a completely different type of interaction between the RNA editing mechanism and the RNAi machinery. ADAR1 forms a complex via direct protein-protein interaction with Dicer, an RNase III gene family member involved in the RNAi mechanism. ADAR1 in the Dicer complex promotes pre-miRNA cleavage by Dicer and facilitates loading of miRNA onto RNA-induced silencing complexes, giving rise to an unsuspected stimulative function of ADAR1 on miRNA processing and RNAi mechanisms. ADAR1 differentiates its functions in RNA editing and RNAi by formation of either ADAR1-ADAR1 homodimer or Dicer-ADAR1 heterodimer complexes. Expression of miRNAs is globally inhibited in ADAR1-null mouse embryos, which, in turn, alters expression of their target genes and may contribute to their embryonic lethal phenotype.",2013 Aug,RNA Biol. 2013 Aug;10(8):1240-7. doi: 10.4161/rna.25947.

In this study, we investigated the interaction of the RNA editing mechanism with the RNA interference (RNAi) machinery and found that ADAR1 forms a complex with Dicer through direct protein-protein interaction. Most importantly, ADAR1 increases the maximum rate (Vmax) of pre-microRNA (miRNA) cleavage by Dicer and facilitates loading of miRNA onto RNA-induced silencing complexes, identifying a new role of ADAR1 in miRNA processing and RNAi mechanisms. ADAR1 differentiates its functions in RNA editing and RNAi by the formation of either ADAR1/ADAR1 homodimer or Dicer/ADAR1 heterodimer complexes, respectively.

23394403,Potent and selective inhibition of A-to-I RNA editing with 2'-O-methyl/locked nucleic acid-containing antisense oligoribonucleotides.,"ADARs (adenosine deaminases acting on RNA) are RNA editing enzymes that bind double helical RNAs and deaminate select adenosines (A). The product inosine (I) is read during translation as guanosine (G), so such changes can alter codon meaning. ADAR-catalyzed A to I changes occur in coding sequences for several proteins of importance to the nervous system. However, these sites constitute only a very small fraction of known A to I sites in the human transcriptome, and the significance of editing at the vast majority sites is unknown at this time. Site-selective inhibitors of RNA editing are needed to advance our understanding of the function of editing at specific sites. Here we show that 2'-O-methyl/locked nucleic acid (LNA) mixmer antisense oligonucleotides are potent and selective inhibitors of RNA editing on two different target RNAs. These reagents are capable of binding with high affinity to RNA editing substrates and remodeling the secondary structure by a strand-invasion mechanism. The potency observed here for 2'-O-methyl/LNA mixmers suggests this backbone structure is superior to the morpholino backbone structure for inhibition of RNA editing. Finally, we demonstrate antisense inhibition of editing of the mRNA for the DNA repair glycosylase NEIL1 in cultured human cells, providing a new approach to exploring the link between RNA editing and the cellular response to oxidative DNA damage.",2013 Apr 19,ACS Chem Biol. 2013 Apr 19;8(4):832-9. doi: 10.1021/cb300692k.

In this study, we reported an essential role of ADAR1 in the survival and maintenance of intestinal stem cells and intestinal homoeostasis by suppressing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and interferon (IFN) signaling. ADAR1 was highly expressed in the Lgr5+ cells, and its deletion in adult mice led to a rapid apoptosis and loss of these actively cycling stem cells in the small intestine and colon. ADAR1 deletion resulted in a drastic expansion of progenitors and Paneth cells but a reduction of three other major epithelial lineages. Moreover, loss of ADAR1 induced ER stress and activation of IFN signaling, and altered expression in WNT targets, followed by intestinal inflammation. An ER stress inhibitor partially suppressed crypt apoptosis. Finally, data from cultured intestinal crypts demonstrated that loss of ADAR1 in the epithelial cells is the primary cause of these effects.

22987615,Deletion of the RNA-editing enzyme ADAR1 causes regression of established chronic myelogenous leukemia in mice.,"Patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) respond well to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) of the Bcr-Abl oncoprotein. However, intolerance and resistance to these agents remains a challenge, and TKIs are unable to eradicate rare leukemia-initiating cells. Leukemia treatment would benefit from a better understanding of molecular signals that are necessary for the survival of leukemia-initiating cells but dispensable for normal hematopoietic stem cells. Leukemia-initiating cells in CML can arise from myeloid progenitor cells, a population that we have reported in normal hematopoiesis to depend on the RNA-editing enzyme adenosine deaminase acting on RNA-1 (ADAR1). We now report that Bcr-Abl transformed leukemic cells were ADAR1-dependent in a conditional ADAR1 knockout mouse model. ADAR1 deletion reversed leukocytosis and splenomegaly, and preferentially depleted primitive Lin-Sca+Kit+ (LSK) leukemic cells but not LSK cells lacking the leukemic oncoprotein. ADAR1 deletion ultimately normalized the peripheral white blood count, eliminating leukemic cells as assessed by PCR.

Behavioral patterns and brain changes related to a possible addictive overeating in these transgenic mice were explored as transgenic mice display chronic hyperphagia. ADAR2 transgenic mice were assessed in their food preference and motivation to overeat in a competing reward environment with ad lib access to a running wheel and food. Metabolic activity of brain and peripheral tissue were assessed with [(18) F] fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) and RNA expression of feeding related genes, ADAR2, dopamine and opiate receptors from the hypothalamus and striatum were examined.

22063822,Biased mutational pattern and quasispecies hypothesis in H5N1 virus.,"Like other RNA viruses, influenza viruses are subject to high mutation rates. Carrying segmented RNA genomes, their genetic variability is even higher. We aimed at analyzing the mutational events occurring during the infection of chickens by the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus. We therefore studied the different sequences of two surface proteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), as well as two internal proteins, PB2 and NS. Three organs (lung, spleen, brain) were obtained from a chicken, experimentally infected with a lethal dose of HPAI H5N1 virus. Cloning these PCR fragments enabled us to investigate the mutations undergone by the virus after several replicative cycles. The first outcome is the presence of a strong mutational bias, resembling host-driven ADAR1 adenosine deamination, which is responsible for 81% of all mutations. Whereas the frequency of RNA dependent RNA polymerase-related mutations is compatible with the survival of the virus, the ADAR1-like activity usually strongly increases the mutation frequency into a level of ""error catastrophe"" in theory incompatible with virus survival. Nevertheless, the virus was successfully infective. HPAI H5N1 virus displayed traits in agreement with the quasispecies theory.

22494436,Chronic wounds - is cellular 'reception' at fault? Examining integrins and intracellular signalling.,"As with all physiologic processes, chronic wounds are associated with unique intracellular and cellular/extracellular matrix (ECM) receptor types and signalling messages. These cellular receptors mediate responses of the epidermis to provisional wound matrix and change in form and number in cases of impaired wound healing. Integrins are the major cell-surface receptors for cell adhesion and migration and epidermal keratinocytes express several integrins that bind ECM ligands in provisional wound ECM. Integrin receptors and more particularly integrin clusters and focal adhesion points appear to influence epidermal and dermal cell matrix interactions, cell motility, cell phenotype and ultimate healing trajectory. In chronic wounds, a variety of changes in receptors have been identified: decreased integrin α5β1 receptors affect the integration of fibronectin and subsequent keratinocyte migration; integrin αvβ6 stimulate transforming growth factor (TGF)-β and may increase the susceptibility to ulceration and fibrosis; however, TGF-β signal receptors have been found to be dysfunctional in many chronic wounds; additionally receptor interactions result in increased senescent cells including fibroblasts, myofibroblasts and even keratinocytes - this produces a degradative ECM and wound bed and corrosive chronic wound fluid. The activation or inhibition of integrin receptors by various agents may provide an excellent means of influencing wound healing. This process offers an earlier intervention into the wound healing cascade promoting intrinsic healing and elaboration of growth factors and ECM proteins, which may be more cost effective than the traditional attempts at extrinsic addition of these agents.",2013 Apr,Int Wound J. 2013 Apr;10(2):185-92. doi: 10.1111/j.1742-481X.2012.00967.x.

23616744,Reciprocal regulation of A-to-I RNA editing and the vertebrate nervous system.,"The fine control of molecules mediating communication in the nervous system is key to adjusting neuronal signaling during development and in maintaining the stability of established networks in the face of altered sensory input. To prevent the culmination of pathological recurrent network excitation or debilitating periods of quiescence, adaptive alterations occur in the signaling molecules and ion channels that control membrane excitability and synaptic transmission. However, rather than encoding (and thus ""hardwiring"") modified gene copies, the nervous systems of metazoa have opted for expanding on post-transcriptional pre-mRNA splicing by altering key encoded amino acids using a conserved mechanism of A-to-I RNA editing: the enzymatic deamination of adenosine to inosine. Inosine exhibits similar base-pairing properties to guanosine with respect to tRNA codon recognition, replication by polymerases, and RNA secondary structure (i.e.,: forming-capacity). In addition to recoding within the open reading frame, adenosine deamination also occurs with high frequency throughout the non-coding transcriptome, where it affects multiple aspects of RNA metabolism and gene expression. Here, we describe the recoding function of key RNA editing targets in the mammalian central nervous system and their potential to be regulated. We will then discuss how interactions of A-to-I editing with gene expression and alternative splicing could play a wider role in regulating the neuronal transcriptome.

NS1 is a multifunctional protein and a virulence factor while NS2 is involved in nuclear export of viral ribonucleoprotein complexes. A yeast two-hybrid screening strategy was used to identify host factors supporting NS1 and NS2 functions. More than 560 interactions between 79 cellular proteins and NS1 and NS2 proteins from 9 different influenza virus strains have been identified. These interacting proteins are potentially involved in each step of the infectious process and their contribution to viral replication was tested by RNA interference. Validation of the relevance of these host cell proteins for the viral replication cycle revealed that 7 of the 79 NS1 and/or NS2-interacting proteins positively or negatively controlled virus replication. One of the main factors targeted by NS1 of all virus strains was double-stranded RNA binding domain protein family. In particular, adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) appeared as a pro-viral host factor whose expression is necessary for optimal viral protein synthesis and replication. Surprisingly, ADAR1 also appeared as a pro-viral host factor for dengue virus replication and directly interacted with the viral NS3 protein. ADAR1 editing activity was enhanced by both viruses through dengue virus NS3 and influenza virus NS1 proteins, suggesting a similar virus-host co-evolution.",2013,PLoS Pathog. 2013;9(7):e1003440. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1003440.

24147060,F11R expression upon hypoxia is regulated by RNA editing.,"F11R is a cell adhesion molecule found on the surface of human platelets. It plays a role in platelet aggregation, cell migration and cell proliferation. F11R is subjected to RNA editing, a post-transcriptional modification which affects RNA structure, stability, localization, translation and splicing. RNA editing in the 3'UTR of F11R and RNA levels are increased upon hypoxia. We therefore set to examine if RNA editing plays a role in the increase of F11R RNA seen upon hypoxic conditions. We show that ADAR1, but not ADAR2, takes part in the editing of F11R however editing alone is not sufficient for obtaining an elevation in RNA levels. In addition we show that hyper-edited mature mRNAs are retained in the nucleus and are associated with p54(nrb). We therefore conclude that hypoxia-induced edited RNAs of F11R are preferentially stabilized and accumulate in the nucleus preventing their export to the cytoplasm for translation. This mechanism may be used by additional proteins in the cell as part of the cell's effort to reduce metabolism upon hypoxic stress.",2013,PLoS One. 2013 Oct 16;8(10):e77702. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0077702. eCollection 2013.,"['Ben-Zvi M', 'Amariglio N', 'Paret G', 'Nevo-Caspi Y']",True

This QTL is composed of 124 genes, some of them being involved in metabolism or reproduction. Primiparous Fertil+ and Fertil- cows exhibited 69 and 39% pregnancy rate at first service, respectively. A difference in plasma nonesterified fatty acid concentrations observed between both haplotypes might indicate a difference in adipose tissue mobilization. We compared adipose tissue gene expression in Fertil+ and Fertil- cows during their second lactation, at 2 physiological stages, implying either intense lipid mobilization (1 wk postpartum) or fat storage (5 mo of gestation). We investigated by reverse-transcription quantitative PCR the mRNA gene expression of 5 positional candidate genes located in the QTL-Fert-F-BTA3, as well as 18 other functional candidate genes encoding proteins involved in lipid metabolism and several adipokines. Among them, genes involved in either lipolysis or lipogenesis were chosen as controls because they were previously described in dairy cow adipose tissue. A hierarchical clustering was performed to group genes according to their expression pattern, allowing 2 clusters to be determined. Cluster 1 was composed of genes that were overexpressed during mobilization (ADIPOQ, ADIPOR2, LIPE, FABP4, PLIN1, RARRES, LEPR, and CPT1A) and cluster 2 of genes overexpressed during reconstitution of body reserves (ACACA, FASN, and SCD). Genes belonging to cluster 1 (LIPE, FABP4, PLIN1, and CPT1A) are known to be involved in lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation, and genes belonging to cluster 2 (ACACA, FASN, and SCD) are known to be involved in fatty acid synthesis. The expression of 5 genes from cluster 1 was correlated to plasma nonesterified fatty acid levels and thus to mobilization of body reserves in dairy cows (ADIPOQ, ADIPOR2, LIPE, PLIN1, and FABP4). During the mobilization stage, none of the positional candidate genes belonging to QTL-Fert-F-BTA3 (ADAR, MTX1, SHC1, SPTA1, and PAQR6) showed a difference in expression between the 2 haplotypes.

Repressive heterochromatin is established through the RNA interference pathway, triggered by double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) that can be modified via RNA editing. However, the biological consequences of such modifications remain enigmatic. Here we show that RNA editing regulates heterochromatic gene silencing in Drosophila. We utilize the binding activity of an RNA-editing enzyme to visualize the in vivo production of a long dsRNA trigger mediated by Hoppel transposable elements. Using homologous recombination, we delete this trigger, dramatically altering heterochromatic gene silencing and chromatin architecture. Furthermore, we show that the trigger RNA is edited and that dADAR serves as a key regulator of chromatin state. Additionally, dADAR auto-editing generates a natural suppressor of gene silencing. Lastly, systemic differences in RNA editing activity generates interindividual variation in silencing state within a population.

24289319,Adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing and human disease.,"A-to-I RNA editing is a post-transcriptional modification that converts adenosines to inosines in both coding and noncoding RNA transcripts. It is catalyzed by ADAR (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA) enzymes, which exist throughout the body but are most prevalent in the central nervous system. Inosines exhibit properties that are most similar to those of guanosines. As a result, ADAR-mediated editing can post-transcriptionally alter codons, introduce or remove splice sites, or affect the base pairing of the RNA molecule with itself or with other RNAs. A-to-I editing is a mechanism that regulates and diversifies the transcriptome, but the full biological significance of ADARs is not understood. ADARs are highly conserved across vertebrates and are essential for normal development in mammals. Aberrant ADAR activity has been associated with a wide range of human diseases, including cancer, neurological disorders, metabolic diseases, viral infections and autoimmune disorders. ADARs have been shown to contribute to disease pathologies by editing of glutamate receptors, editing of serotonin receptors, mutations in ADAR genes, and by other mechanisms, including recently identified regulatory roles in microRNA processing. Advances in research into many of these diseases may depend on an improved understanding of the biological functions of ADARs.

RNA editing catalyzed by members of the adenosine deaminase acting on the RNA (ADAR) family could target the miRNA precursors and affect the biogenesis process. Therefore, we investigate whether RNA editing could be one mechanism contributing to the deregulation of specific miRNAs in HCC. By overexpression of individual ADARs in hepatoma cells, RNA editing on the precursors of 16 miRNAs frequently deregulated in HCC was screened by a sensitive high-resolution melting platform. The results identified RNA precursors of miR-214 and miR-122 as potential targets edited by ADAR2. A subset of HCC showing elevated ADAR2 verified the major editings identified in ARAR2 overexpressed hepatoma cells, either with A-to-I or U-to-C changes. The unusual U-to-C editing at specific residues was demonstrated as being attributed to the A-to-I editing on the RNA transcripts complementary to the pri-miRNAs. The editing event caused a decrease of the RNA transcript complementary to pri-miR-214, which led to the decrease of pri-miR-214 and miR-214 and resulted in the increased protein level of its novel target gene Rab15. In conclusion, the current study discovered ADAR2-mediated editing of the complementary antisense transcripts as a novel mechanism for regulating the biogenesis of specific miRNAs during hepatocarcinogenesis.",2013,PLoS One. 2013 Dec 27;8(12):e81922. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0081922. eCollection 2013.,"['Liu WH', 'Chen CH', 'Yeh KH', 'Li CL', 'Wu YJ', 'Chen DS', 'Chen PJ', 'Yeh SH']",False

22832026,RNA editing of protein sequences: a rare event in human transcriptomes.,"RNA editing, the post-transcriptional recoding of RNA molecules, has broad potential implications for gene expression. Several recent studies of human transcriptomes reported a high number of differences between DNA and RNA, including events not explained by any known mammalian RNA-editing mechanism. However, RNA-editing estimates differ by orders of magnitude, since technical limitations of high-throughput sequencing have been sometimes overlooked and sequencing errors have been confounded with editing sites. Here, we developed a series of computational approaches to analyze the extent of this process in the human transcriptome, identifying and addressing the major sources of error of a large-scale approach. We apply the detection pipeline to deep sequencing data from lymphoblastoid cell lines expressing ADAR1 at high levels, and show that noncanonical editing is unlikely to occur, with at least 85%-98% of candidate sites being the result of sequencing and mapping artifacts. By implementing a method to detect intronless gene duplications, we show that most noncanonical sites previously validated originate in read mismapping within these regions. Canonical A-to-G editing, on the other hand, is widespread in noncoding Alu sequences and rare in exonic and coding regions, where the validation rate also dropped. The genomic distribution of editing sites we find, together with the lack of consistency across studies or biological replicates, suggest a minor quantitative impact of this process in the overall recoding of protein sequences. We propose instead a primary role of ADAR1 protein as a defense system against elements potentially damaging to the genome.",2012 Sep,RNA. 2012 Sep;18(9):1586-96. doi: 10.1261/rna.033233.112.

Since inosine is recognized during translation as guanosine, this often results in the expression of protein sequences different from those encoded in the genome. While our knowledge of the ADAR2 structure and catalytic mechanism has grown over the years, our knowledge of ADAR1 has lagged. This is due, at least in part, to the lack of well defined, small RNA substrates useful for mechanistic studies of ADAR1. Here, we describe an ADAR1 substrate RNA that can be prepared by a combination of chemical synthesis and enzymatic ligation. Incorporation of adenosine analogs into this RNA and analysis of the rate of ADAR1 catalyzed deamination revealed similarities and differences in the way the ADARs recognize the edited nucleotide. Importantly, ADAR1 is more dependent than ADAR2 on the presence of N7 in the edited base. This difference between ADAR1 and ADAR2 appears to be dependent on the identity of a single amino acid residue near the active site.

We performed a screen in yeast to identify mutations in the hADAR2 catalytic domain that allow editing of an adenosine within a disfavored triplet. Binding affinity, catalytic rate, base flipping, and preferences were monitored to understand the effects of the mutations on ADAR reactivity. Our data provide information on the amino acids that affect preferences and point to a conserved loop as being of key importance.

23001123,Mutations in ADAR1 cause Aicardi-Goutières syndrome associated with a type I interferon signature.,"Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) catalyze the hydrolytic deamination of adenosine to inosine in double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and thereby potentially alter the information content and structure of cellular RNAs. Notably, although the overwhelming majority of such editing events occur in transcripts derived from Alu repeat elements, the biological function of non-coding RNA editing remains uncertain. Here, we show that mutations in ADAR1 (also known as ADAR) cause the autoimmune disorder Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS). As in Adar1-null mice, the human disease state is associated with upregulation of interferon-stimulated genes, indicating a possible role for ADAR1 as a suppressor of type I interferon signaling. Considering recent insights derived from the study of other AGS-related proteins, we speculate that ADAR1 may limit the cytoplasmic accumulation of the dsRNA generated from genomic repetitive elements.",2012 Nov,Nat Genet. 2012 Nov;44(11):1243-8. doi: 10.1038/ng.2414.

22457361,Extra double-stranded RNA binding domain (dsRBD) in a squid RNA editing enzyme confers resistance to high salt environment.,"A-to-I RNA editing is particularly common in coding regions of squid mRNAs. Previously, we isolated a squid editing enzyme (sqADAR2) that shows a unique structural feature when compared with other ADAR2 family members: an additional double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) binding domain (dsRBD). Alternative splicing includes or excludes this motif, generating a novel or a conventional variant termed sqADAR2a and sqADAR2b, respectively. The extra dsRBD of sqADAR2a increases its editing activity in vitro. We hypothesized that the high activity is due to an increase in the affinity of the enzyme for dsRNA. This may be important because protein-RNA interactions can be influenced by physical factors. We became particularly interested in analyzing the effects of salt on interactions between sqADAR2 and RNA because squid cells have a ∼3-fold higher ionic strength and proportionally more Cl(-) than vertebrate cells. To date, in vitro biochemical analyses of adenosine deamination have been conducted using vertebrate-like ionic strength buffers containing chloride as the major anion, although the vast majority of cellular anions are known to be organic. We found that squid-like salt conditions severely impair the binding affinity of conventional ADAR2s for dsRNA, leading to a decrease in nonspecific and site-specific editing activity. Inhibition of editing was mostly due to high Cl(-) levels and not to the high concentrations of K(+), Na(+), and organic anions like glutamate. Interestingly, the extra dsRBD in sqADAR2a conferred resistance to the high Cl(-) levels found in squid neurons. It does so by increasing the affinity of sqADAR2 for dsRNA by 30- or 100-fold in vertebrate-like or squid-like conditions, respectively. Site-directed mutagenesis of squid ADAR2a showed that its increased affinity and editing activity are directly attributable to the RNA binding activity of the extra dsRBD.",2012 May 18,J Biol Chem. 2012 May 18;287(21):17754-17764. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M112.366005.

22366356,RNA editing of the Q/R site of GluA2 in different cultured cell lines that constitutively express different levels of RNA editing enzyme ADAR2.,"Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 2 (ADAR2) catalyzes RNA editing at the glutamine/arginine (Q/R) site of GluA2, and an ADAR2 deficiency may play a role in the death of motor neurons in ALS patients. The expression level of ADAR2 mRNA is a determinant of the editing activity at the GluA2 Q/R site in human brain but not in cultured cells. Therefore, we investigated the extent of Q/R site-editing in the GluA2 mRNA and pre-mRNA as well as the ADAR2 mRNA and GluA2 mRNA and pre-mRNA levels in various cultured cell lines. The extent of the GluA2 mRNA editing was 100% except in SH-SY5Y cells, which have a much lower level of ADAR2 than the other cell lines examined. The ADAR2 activity at the GluA2 pre-mRNA Q/R site correlated with the ADAR2 mRNA level relative to the GluA2 pre-mRNA. SH-SY5Y cells expressed higher level of the GluA2 mRNA in the cytoplasm compared with other cell lines. These results suggest that the ADAR2 expression level reflects editing activity at the GluA2 Q/R site and that although the edited GluA2 pre-mRNA is readily spliced, the unedited GluA2 pre-mRNA is also spliced and transported to the cytoplasm when ADAR2 expression is low.",2012 May,Neurosci Res. 2012 May;73(1):42-8. doi: 10.1016/j.neures.2012.02.002.

22570068,[Molecular link between inefficient GluA2 RNA editing and TDP-43 pathology in ALS motor neurons].,"The motor neurons of sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients exhibit several molecular abnormalities, including 2 that are specific to ALS motor neurons: (1) pathological changes related to the mislocalization of the TAR DNA-binding protein (TDP-43), including both the appearance of phosphorylated TDP-43-containing inclusions in the cytoplasm and the loss of TDP-43 from the nucleus; and (2) inefficient RNA editing at the Q/R site of GluA2, a subunit of the AMPA receptor. TDP-43-related pathological features are closely associated with ALS in most ALS patients and with significant behavioral and pathological changes in genetically engineered mice; therefore, abnormal TDP-43 processing is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of ALS. The extent of GluA2 RNA editing decreases in the motor neurons of sporadic ALS patients in a disease-specific and motor neuron-selective manner. Importantly, this molecular abnormality is a direct cause of death of motor neurons in conditional knockout mice for adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 2 (ADAR2), the enzyme that specifically catalyzes RNA editing at the GluA2 Q/R site. Notably, these molecular abnormalities, i.e., TDP-43-related pathological features and inefficient GluA2 RNA editing, are found in approximately half of the motor neurons in sporadic ALS patients and both of them always occur in the same motor neurons. Because TDP-43-related pathological features and inefficient GluA2 RNA editing are highly disease specific in ALS motor neurons, investigation into the molecular link between these abnormalities is likely to provide new insights into ALS pathogenesis.",2012 May,Brain Nerve. 2012 May;64(5):549-56.,['Kwak S'],True
22085847,Zalpha-domains: at the intersection between RNA editing and innate immunity.,"The involvement of A to I RNA editing in antiviral responses was first indicated by the observation of genomic hyper-mutation for several RNA viruses in the course of persistent infections. However, in only a few cases an antiviral role was ever demonstrated and surprisingly, it turns out that ADARs - the RNA editing enzymes - may have a prominent pro-viral role through the modulation/down-regulation of the interferon response. A key role in this regulatory function of RNA editing is played by ADAR1, an interferon inducible RNA editing enzyme. A distinguishing feature of ADAR1, when compared with other ADARs, is the presence of a Z-DNA binding domain, Zalpha. Since the initial discovery of the specific and high affinity binding of Zalpha to CpG repeats in a left-handed helical conformation, other proteins, all related to the interferon response pathway, were shown to have similar domains throughout the vertebrate lineage. What is the biological function of this domain family remains unclear but a significant body of work provides pieces of a puzzle that points to an important role of Zalpha domains in the recognition of foreign nucleic acids in the cytoplasm by the innate immune system. Here we will provide an overview of our knowledge on ADAR1 function in interferon response with emphasis on Zalpha domains.",2012 May,Semin Cell Dev Biol. 2012 May;23(3):275-80. doi: 10.1016/j.semcdb.2011.11.001.

To answer the question of how Z-DNA binding proteins induce B-Z transitions in CG-rich segments while maintaining the B-conformation of surrounding segments, we investigated the kinetics and thermodynamics of base-pair openings of a 13-bp DNA in complex with the Z-DNA binding protein, Zα(ADAR1). We also studied perturbations in the backbone of Zα(ADAR1) upon binding to DNA. Our study demonstrates the initial contact conformation as an intermediate structure during B-Z junction formation induced by Zα(ADAR1), in which the Zα(ADAR1) protein displays unique backbone conformational changes, but the 13-bp DNA duplex maintains the B-form helix. We also found the unique structural features of the 13-bp DNA duplex in the initial contact conformation: (i) instability of the AT-rich region II and (ii) longer lifetime for the opening state of the CG-rich region I. Our findings suggest a three-step mechanism of B-Z junction formation: (i) Zα(ADAR1) specifically interacts with a CG-rich DNA segment maintaining B-form helix via a unique conformation; (ii) the neighboring AT-rich region becomes very unstable, and the CG-rich DNA segment is easily converted to Z-DNA; and (iii) the AT-rich regions are base-paired again, and the B-Z junction structure is formed.",2012 Mar 21,J Am Chem Soc. 2012 Mar 21;134(11):5276-83. doi: 10.1021/ja211581b.

Tudor-SN has been implicated in diverse roles in mammalian cells, including transcription, splicing, RNAi, and degradation. Moreover, we have shown that Tudor-SN interacts directly with stress granule proteins. Here we show that Tudor-SN localizes to cytoplasmic stress granules in HeLa cells undergoing arsenite-induced oxidative stress, or following transfection with long dsRNA (poly[IC]), which initiates an interferon cascade. We additionally demonstrate a novel interaction between Tudor-SN and ADAR1.

Viral RNA was co-precipitated with HA-tagged A3G and could be amplified by RT-PCR.

22226999,Profound downregulation of the RNA editing enzyme ADAR2 in ALS spinal motor neurons.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common adult-onset fatal motor neuron disease. In spinal motor neurons of patients with sporadic ALS, normal RNA editing of GluA2, a subunit of the L-α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor, is inefficient. Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 2 (ADAR2) specifically mediates RNA editing at the glutamine/arginine (Q/R) site of GluA2 and motor neurons expressing Q/R site-unedited GluA2 undergo slow death in conditional ADAR2 knockout mice. Therefore, investigation into whether inefficient ADAR2-mediated GluA2 Q/R site-editing occurs universally in motor neurons of patients with ALS would provide insight into the pathogenesis of ALS. We analyzed the extents of GluA2 Q/R site-editing in an individual laser-captured motor neuron of 29 ALS patients compared with those of normal and disease control subjects. In addition, we analyzed the enzymatic activity of three members of the ADAR family (ADAR1, ADAR2 and ADAR3) in ALS motor neurons expressing unedited GluA2 mRNA and those expressing only edited GluA2 mRNA. Q/R site-unedited GluA2 mRNA was expressed in a significant proportion of motor neurons from all of the ALS cases examined. Conversely, motor neurons of the normal and disease control subjects expressed only edited GluA2 mRNA. ADAR2, but not ADAR1 or ADAR3, was significantly downregulated in all the motor neurons of ALS patients, more extensively in those expressing Q/R site-unedited GluA2 mRNA than those expressing only Q/R site-edited GluA2 mRNA.

The occurrence may be related by a number of variable factors that collectively or individually can halt the process of orderly healing. A number of biologic events occurring at the wound bed interface, outside the wound (exudate), and related to systemic chronic disease profiles have been identified. This assists clinicians and researchers in developing a systematic approach to managing and reversing this undesired event. First, host factors related to any background chronic disease are checked and controlled. Second, the focus turns to local wound factors adopting accepted principles of wound care to control the wound environment, adding systemic therapies where necessary. If this fails to change the healing milieu, more sophisticated, specialized local wound interventions are introduced.

22493439,Influenza virus partially counteracts restriction imposed by tetherin/BST-2.,"Influenza virus infections lead to a burst of type I interferon (IFN) in the human respiratory tract, which most probably accounts for a rapid control of the virus. Although in mice, IFN-induced Mx1 factor mediates a major part of this response, the situation is less clear in humans. Interestingly, a recently identified IFN-induced cellular protein, tetherin (also known as CD317, BST-2, or HM1.24), exerts potent antiviral activity against a broad range of retroviruses, as well as several other enveloped viruses, by impeding the release of newly generated viral particles from the cell surface. Here we show that influenza virus belongs to the targets of this potent antiviral factor. Ectopic expression of tetherin strongly inhibited fully replicative influenza virus. In addition, depleting endogenous tetherin increased viral production of influenza virions, both in cells constitutively expressing tetherin and upon its induction by IFN. We further demonstrate, by biochemical and morphological means, that tetherin exerts its antiviral action by tethering newly budded viral particles, a mechanism similar to the one that operates against HIV-1. In addition, we determined that the magnitude of tetherin antiviral activity is comparable with or higher than the one of several previously identified anti-influenza cellular factors, such as MxA, ADAR1, ISG15, and viperin. Finally, we demonstrate that influenza virus reduces the impact of tetherin-mediated restriction on its replication by several mechanisms. First, the influenza virus NS1 protein impedes IFN-mediated tetherin induction. Second, influenza infection leads to a decrease of tetherin steady state levels, and the neuraminidase surface protein partly counteracts its activity.

Inosine is read as guanosine by the translation machinery; therefore A-to-I editing events in coding sequences may result in recoding genetic information. Whereas vertebrates have two catalytically active enzymes, namely ADAR1 and ADAR2, Drosophila has a single ADAR protein (dADAR) related to ADAR2. The structural determinants controlling substrate recognition and editing of a specific adenosine within dsRNA substrates are only partially understood. Here, we report the solution structure of the N-terminal dsRNA binding domain (dsRBD) of dADAR and use NMR chemical shift perturbations to identify the protein surface involved in RNA binding. Additionally, we show that Drosophila ADAR edits the R/G site in the mammalian GluR-2 pre-mRNA which is naturally modified by both ADAR1 and ADAR2. We then constructed a model showing how dADAR dsRBD1 binds to the GluR-2 R/G stem-loop. This model revealed that most side chains interacting with the RNA sugar-phosphate backbone need only small displacement to adapt for dsRNA binding and are thus ready to bind to their dsRNA target. It also predicts that dADAR dsRBD1 would bind to dsRNA with less sequence specificity than dsRBDs of ADAR2.

To examine the involvement of altered RNA editing in these disorders, we: (i) quantified the mRNA levels of the adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) editing enzymes by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and (ii) measured the editing levels in transcripts of several neuroreceptors using 454 high-throughput sequencing, in dorsolateral-prefrontal cortices of schizophrenics, BPD patients and controls. Increased expression of specific ADAR2 variants with diminished catalytic activity was observed in schizophrenia. Our results also indicate that the I/V editing site in the glutamate receptor, ionotropic kainate 2 (GRIK2) transcript is under-edited in BPD (type I) patients (45.8 versus 53.9%, P= 0.023). GRIK2 has been implicated in mood disorders, and editing of its I/V site can modulate Ca(+2) permeability of the channel, consistent with numerous observations of elevated intracellular Ca(+2) levels in BPD patients. Our findings may therefore, at least partly, explain a molecular mechanism underlying the disorder. In addition, an intriguing correlation was found between editing events on separate exons of GRIK2. Finally, multiple novel editing sites were detected near previously known sites, albeit most with very low editing rates. This supports the hypothesis raised previously regarding the existence of wide-spread low-level 'background' editing as a mechanism that enhances adaptation and evolvability.",2012 Jan 15,Hum Mol Genet. 2012 Jan 15;21(2):311-21. doi: 10.1093/hmg/ddr461.

22100336,Regulation of alternative splicing within the supraspliceosome.,"Alternative splicing is a fundamental feature in regulating the eukaryotic transcriptome, as ~95% of multi-exon human Pol II transcripts are subject to this process. Regulated splicing operates through the combinatorial interplay of positive and negative regulatory signals present in the pre-mRNA, which are recognized by trans-acting factors. All these RNA and protein components are assembled in a gigantic, 21 MDa, ribonucleoprotein splicing machine - the supraspliceosome. Because most alternatively spliced mRNA isoforms vary between different cell and tissue types, the ability to perform alternative splicing is expected to be an integral part of the supraspliceosome, which constitutes the splicing machine in vivo. Here we show that both the constitutively and alternatively spliced mRNAs of the endogenous human pol II transcripts: hnRNP A/B, survival of motor neuron (SMN) and ADAR2 are predominantly found in supraspliceosomes. This finding is consistent with our observations that the splicing regulators hnRNP G as well as all phosphorylated SR proteins are predominantly associated with supraspliceosomes. We further show that changes in alternative splicing of hnRNP A/B, affected by up regulation of SRSF5 (SRp40) or by treatment with C6-ceramide, occur within supraspliceosomes. These observations support the proposed role of the supraspliceosome in splicing regulation and alternative splicing.",2012 Jan,J Struct Biol. 2012 Jan;177(1):152-9. doi: 10.1016/j.jsb.2011.11.005.

Here we describe a comprehensive profile of the RNA editome of a male Han Chinese individual based on analysis of ∼767 million sequencing reads from poly(A)(+), poly(A)(-) and small RNA samples. We developed a computational pipeline that carefully controls for false positives while calling RNA editing events from genome and whole-transcriptome data of the same individual. We identified 22,688 RNA editing events in noncoding genes and introns, untranslated regions and coding sequences of protein-coding genes. Most changes (∼93%) converted A to I(G), consistent with known editing mechanisms based on adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR). We also found evidence of other types of nucleotide changes; however, these were validated at lower rates.

22266371,GluA2 AMPA glutamate receptor subunit exhibits codon 607 Q/R RNA editing in the lens.,"Regulated GluA2 AMPA receptor subunit expression, RNA editing, and membrane localization are fundamental determinants of neuronal Ca(2+) influx, and underlie basic functions such as memory and the primary brain disorder epilepsy. Consistent with this, AMPARs, and specifically GluA2, are targets of common antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and antidepressants. Recently, epidemiological associations between epilepsy and increased cataract prevalence were found comparable to cataract links with diabetes and smoking. Similarly, use of AEDs and several antidepressants also showed links with increased cataract. Here, we demonstrated GluA2 in lenses, consistent with REST/NRSF and REST4 we described previously in lenses, as well as GluA1 and ADAR2 in the lens. Surprisingly, we found predominant neuron-like Q/R editing of GluA2 RNAs also occurs in the lens and evidence of lens GluA2 phosphorylation and STEP phosphatases linked with GluA2 membrane localization in neurons. This study is among the first to show GluA2 expression and predominant Q/R RNA editing in a non-neural cell.

The importance of A-to-I RNA editing in human disease: from cancer to HIV-1.,"Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) are enzymes that convert adenosine (A) to inosine (I) in nuclear-encoded RNAs and viral RNAs. The activity of ADARs has been demonstrated to be essential in mammals and serves to fine-tune different proteins and modulate many molecular pathways. Recent findings have shown that ADAR activity is altered in many pathological tissues. Moreover, it has been shown that modulation of RNA editing is important for cell proliferation and migration, and has a protective effect on ischaemic insults.

A to I RNA editing consists of an enzymatic conversion of specific adenosine in pre-mRNA, leading to alteration of the properties of both the RNA itself and the translated protein. Currently, the importance of this phenomenon is increasingly recognized as it affects a diverse set of cellular pathways. ADAR function within the cell, especially in the neurons, is to diversify the features of a limited set of unique transcripts, mostly neurotransmitter receptors; however, a growing set of target is going to be discovered, increasing the importance of the RNA editing event in the proper physiology of the cell. Despite the functional relevance of these enzymes, there is a gap of knowledge in the mechanisms that regulate ADAR activity and consequently about the modulation of RNA editing process. This review summarizes ongoing investigations of ADAR regulation at the transcriptional, post-transcriptional and post-translational level and addresses new hypothetical mechanisms that are capable of modulating ADAR activity, including subcellular localization, dimerization and interaction with trans-acting factors.",2012 Feb,Mol Neurobiol. 2012 Feb;45(1):61-75. doi: 10.1007/s12035-011-8220-2.

22210125,"A single nucleotide polymorphism of the adenosine deaminase, RNA-specific gene is associated with the serum triglyceride level, abdominal circumference, and serum adiponectin concentration.","BACKGROUND: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the adenosine deaminase, RNA-specific (ADAR) gene were reported to be associated with human longevity. There are possibilities that ADAR is associated with major risk factors of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases (CVD), such as hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and obesity. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between SNPs of the ADAR gene and clinical data associated with major risk factors of atherosclerotic CVD. SUBJECTS: A total of 1504 general population residents (586 males and 918 females) of two towns, Tanno-cho and Sobestu-cho, in Hokkaido, Japan. METHODS: Clinical data associated with risk factors of atherosclerotic CVD were collected from these study subjects. DNA from peripheral blood and written informed consent were obtained. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms of ADARB1 and ADARB2, which were previously reported to be associated with longevity, were genotyped employing the TaqMan PCR method. The associations between SNPs in ADARB1 and ADARB2 and clinical parameters related to risk factors of atherosclerosis were analyzed. RESULTS: On uni- and multivariate analyses, rs2805533 in ADARB2 was significantly associated with the abdominal circumference, body mass index, serum triglyceride level, and serum adiponectin level. The subjects with the AA genotype of rs2805533 had a greater abdominal circumference, higher body mass index, higher triglyceride level, and lower adiponectin level than those with AG and GG genotypes. CONCLUSION: The SNP in ADARB2 related to longevity is associated with metabolic disorders. This finding suggests that genetic factors modulate human longevity via the regulation of metabolic factors such as abdominal obesity and lipid profiles.",2012 Feb,Exp Gerontol. 2012 Feb;47(2):183-7. doi: 10.1016/j.exger.2011.12.004.

23273215,The ADAR protein family.,"Adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing is a post-transcriptional process by which adenosines are selectively converted to inosines in double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) substrates. A highly conserved group of enzymes, the adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) family, mediates this reaction. All ADARs share a common domain architecture consisting of a variable number of amino-terminal dsRNA binding domains (dsRBDs) and a carboxy-terminal catalytic deaminase domain. ADAR family members are highly expressed in the metazoan nervous system, where these enzymes predominantly localize to the neuronal nucleus. Once in the nucleus, ADARs participate in the modification of specific adenosines in pre-mRNAs of proteins involved in electrical and chemical neurotransmission, including pre-synaptic release machineries, and voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels. Most RNA editing sites in these nervous system targets result in non-synonymous codon changes in functionally important, usually conserved, residues and RNA editing deficiencies in various model organisms bear out a crucial role for ADARs in nervous system function. Mutation or deletion of ADAR genes results in striking phenotypes, including seizure episodes, extreme uncoordination, and neurodegeneration. Not only does the process of RNA editing alter important nervous system peptides, but ADARs also regulate gene expression through modification of dsRNA substrates that enter the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway and may then act at the chromatin level. Here, we present a review on the current knowledge regarding the ADAR protein family, including evolutionary history, key structural features, localization, function and mechanism.",2012 Dec 28,Genome Biol. 2012 Dec 28;13(12):252. doi: 10.1186/gb-2012-13-12-252.,"['Savva YA', 'Rieder LE', 'Reenan RA']",True
23193088,Sequence-dependent structural dynamics of primate adenosine-to-inosine editing substrates.,"Humans have the highest level of adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing amongst primates, yet the reasons for this difference remain unclear. Sequence analysis of the Alu Sg elements (A-to-I RNA substrates) corresponding to the Nup50 gene in human, chimp, and rhesus reveals subtle sequence variations surrounding the edit sites. We have developed three constructs that represent human (HuAp5), chimp (ChAp5), and rhesus (RhAp5) Nup50 Alu Sg A-to-I editing substrates. Here, 2-aminopurine (2-Ap) was substituted for edited adenosine (A5) so as to monitor the fluorescence intensity with respect to temperature. UV and steady-state fluorescence (SSF) T(M) plots indicate that local and global unfolding are coincident, with the human construct displaying a T(M) of approximately 70°C, compared to 60°C for chimp and 54°C for rhesus. However, time-resolved fluorescence (TRF) resolves three different fluorescence lifetimes that we assign to folded, intermediate(s), and unfolded states. The TRF data fit well to a two-intermediate model, whereby both intermediates (M, J) are in equilibrium with each other, and the folded/unfolded states. Our model suggests that, at 37°C, human state J and the folded state will be the most heavily populated in comparison to the other primate constructs. In order for adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) to efficiently dock, a stable duplex must be present that corresponds to the human construct, globally. Next, the enzyme must ""flip out"" the base of interest to facilitate the A-to-I conversion; a nucleotide in an intermediate-like position would enhance this conformational change. Our experiments demonstrate that subtle variations in RNA sequence might contribute to the high A-to-I editing levels found in humans.",2012 Dec 21,Chembiochem. 2012 Dec 21;13(18):2714-21. doi: 10.1002/cbic.201200526.

23026215,An RNA electrophoretic mobility shift and mutational analysis of rnp-4f 5'-UTR intron splicing regulatory proteins in Drosophila reveals a novel new role for a dADAR protein isoform.,"Alternative splicing greatly enhances the diversity of proteins encoded by eukaryotic genomes, and is also important in gene expression control. In contrast to the great depth of knowledge as to molecular mechanisms in the splicing pathway itself, relatively little is known about the regulatory events behind this process. The 5'-UTR and 3'-UTR in pre-mRNAs play a variety of roles in controlling eukaryotic gene expression, including translational modulation, and nearly 4000 of the roughly 14,000 protein coding genes in Drosophila contain introns of unknown functional significance in their 5'-UTR. Here we report the results of an RNA electrophoretic mobility shift analysis of Drosophila rnp-4f 5'-UTR intron 0 splicing regulatory proteins. The pre-mRNA potential regulatory element consists of an evolutionarily-conserved 177-nt stem-loop arising from pairing of intron 0 with part of adjacent exon 2. Incubation of in vitro transcribed probe with embryo protein extract is shown to result in two shifted RNA-protein bands, and protein extract from a dADAR null mutant fly line results in only one shifted band. A mutated stem-loop in which the conserved exon 2 primary sequence is changed but secondary structure maintained by introducing compensatory base changes results in diminished band shifts. To test the hypothesis that dADAR plays a role in intron splicing regulation in vivo, levels of unspliced rnp-4f mRNA in dADAR mutant were compared to wild-type via real-time qRT-PCR. The results show that during embryogenesis unspliced rnp-4f mRNA levels fall by up to 85% in the mutant, in support of the hypothesis. Taken together, these results demonstrate a novel role for dADAR protein in rnp-4f 5'-UTR alternative intron splicing regulation which is consistent with a previously proposed model.",2012 Dec 15,Gene. 2012 Dec 15;511(2):161-8. doi: 10.1016/j.gene.2012.09.088.

The Adenosine Deaminase Acting on RNA (ADAR) family of RNA-editing enzymes selectively deaminate adenosines (A) in double-helical RNA, generating inosine (I). The protocol described here exploits the editing activity of ADAR2 in a yeast-based screen by inserting an editing substrate sequence with a stop codon incorporated at the editing site upstream from the sequence encoding the reporter α-galactosidase. A-to-I editing changes the stop codon to a tryptophan codon, allowing normal expression of the reporter.

Instead, we hope that its contents will trigger investigation of antidepressant drugs along the suggested lines and lead to ensuing patent applications - first and foremost by more focus on astrocytes. Clinical research has already pointed towards the importance of these cells, which account for one quarter of brain cortical volume and at least as much of its oxidative metabolism. Astrocytes express a multitude of receptors, including 5-HT(2B) receptors. In cultured astrocytes acute treatment with any of the five SSRIs, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline, paroxetine, and citalopram, stimulates equipotently and with sufficient affinity to be therapeutically relevant, the 5-HT(2B) receptor. Following EGF receptor transactivation and a resultant autocrine HB-EGF stimulation, these drugs activate two interdependent signal pathways i) the Ras-Raf-Mek-ERK phosphorylation pathway and ii) the PI3K-AKT-GSK-3β pathway, eventually altering gene expression. Chronic treatment with fluoxetine upregulates gene expression of cPLA₂, ADAR2, GluK2 and 5-HT(2B) receptors, and RNA editing of the later two in cultured astrocytes and in astrocytes obtained by fluorescence-activated cell sorting of cells from fluoxetinetreated mice. Chronic treatment also down-regulates the Gq-protein-coupled receptor-induced increase of intracellular Ca²⁺ by inhibiting TRPC function, compromising astrocytic Ca²⁺ re-filling. This affects glycogenolysis and several steps in the signal pathways. Since astrocytes in the mature brain and in our cultures do not express SERT, both acute and chronic effects in cultured astrocytes must be directly mediated by 5-HT(2B) receptor activation.",2012 Dec,Recent Pat CNS Drug Discov. 2012 Dec;7(3):243-53. doi: 10.2174/157488912803252078.,"['Peng L', 'Huang J']",True

While ADAR-1-mediated editing was essentially described for RNA viruses, the present work addresses the issue for two δ-retroviruses, human T-cell leukemia virus type 2 and simian T-cell leukemia virus type 3 (HTLV-2 and STLV-3). We examined whether ADAR-1 could edit HTLV-2 and STLV-3 virus genomes in cell culture and in vivo. Using a highly sensitive PCR-based method, referred to as 3DI-PCR, we showed that ADAR-1 could hypermutate adenosine residues in HTLV-2. STLV-3 hypermutation was obtained without using 3DI-PCR, suggesting a higher mutation frequency for this virus. Detailed analysis of the dinucleotide editing context showed preferences for 5' ArA and 5' UrA.

22310477,Adenosine deaminases that act on RNA induce reproducible changes in abundance and sequence of embryonic miRNAs.,"Adenosine deaminases that act on RNA bind double-stranded and structured RNAs and convert adenosines to inosines by hydrolytic deamination. Inosines are recognized as guanosines, and, hence, RNA editing alters the sequence information but also structure of RNAs. Editing by ADARs is widespread and essential for normal life and development. Precursors of miRNAs are abundantly edited by ADARs, but neither the abundance nor the consequences of miRNA editing has been firmly established. Using transgenic mouse embryos that are deficient in the two enzymatically active editing enzymes ADAR and ADARB1, we compare relative frequencies but also sequence composition of miRNAs in these genetically modified backgrounds to wild-type mice by ""next-generation sequencing."" Deficiency of ADARB1 leads to a reproducible change in abundance of specific miRNAs and their predicted targets. Changes in miRNA abundance seem unrelated to editing events. Additional deletion of ADAR has surprisingly little impact on the mature miRNA repertoire, indicating that miRNA expression is primarily dependent on ADARB1. A-to-G transitions reflecting A-to-I editing events can be detected at few sites and at low frequency during the early embryonic stage investigated. Again, most editing events are ADARB1-dependent with only few editing sites being specifically edited by ADAR. Besides known editing events in miRNAs, a few novel, previously unknown editing events were identified. Some editing events are located to the seed region of miRNAs, opening the possibility that editing leads to their retargeting.",2012 Aug,Genome Res. 2012 Aug;22(8):1468-76. doi: 10.1101/gr.133025.111.

22499667,Systematic identification of edited microRNAs in the human brain.,"Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing modifies RNA transcripts from their genomic blueprint. A prerequisite for this process is a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) structure. Such dsRNAs are formed as part of the microRNA (miRNA) maturation process, and it is therefore expected that miRNAs are affected by A-to-I editing. Editing of miRNAs has the potential to add another layer of complexity to gene regulation pathways, especially if editing occurs within the miRNA-mRNA recognition site. Thus, it is of interest to study the extent of this phenomenon. Current reports in the literature disagree on its extent; while some reports claim that it may be widespread, others deem the reported events as rare. Utilizing a next-generation sequencing (NGS) approach supplemented by an extensive bioinformatic analysis, we were able to systematically identify A-to-I editing events in mature miRNAs derived from human brain tissues. Our algorithm successfully identified many of the known editing sites in mature miRNAs and revealed 17 novel human sites, 12 of which are in the recognition sites of the miRNAs. We confirmed most of the editing events using in vitro ADAR overexpression assays. The editing efficiency of most sites identified is very low. Similar results are obtained for publicly available data sets of mouse brain-regions tissues. Thus, we find that A-to-I editing does alter several miRNAs, but it is not widespread.",2012 Aug,Genome Res. 2012 Aug;22(8):1533-40. doi: 10.1101/gr.131573.111.

While editing in small RNAs was rare, at least 40% of microRNAs had altered levels in at least one ADAR mutant strain, and miRNAs with significantly altered levels had mRNA targets with correspondingly affected levels. About 40% of siRNAs derived from endogenous genes (endo-siRNAs) also had altered levels in at least one mutant strain, including 63% of Dicer-dependent endo-siRNAs. The 26G class of endo-siRNAs was significantly affected by ADARs, and many altered 26G loci had intronic reads and histone modifications associated with transcriptional silencing.

22524474,High levels of RNA-editing site conservation amongst 15 laboratory mouse strains.,"BACKGROUND: Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing is a site-selective post-transcriptional alteration of double-stranded RNA by ADAR deaminases that is crucial for homeostasis and development. Recently the Mouse Genomes Project generated genome sequences for 17 laboratory mouse strains and rich catalogues of variants. We also generated RNA-seq data from whole brain RNA from 15 of the sequenced strains. RESULTS: Here we present a computational approach that takes an initial set of transcriptome/genome mismatch sites and filters these calls taking into account systematic biases in alignment, single nucleotide variant calling, and sequencing depth to identify RNA editing sites with high accuracy. We applied this approach to our panel of mouse strain transcriptomes identifying 7,389 editing sites with an estimated false-discovery rate of between 2.9 and 10.5%. The overwhelming majority of these edits were of the A-to-I type, with less than 2.4% not of this class, and only three of these edits could not be explained as alignment artifacts. We validated 24 novel RNA editing sites in coding sequence, including two non-synonymous edits in the Cacna1d gene that fell into the IQ domain portion of the Cav1.2 voltage-gated calcium channel, indicating a potential role for editing in the generation of transcript diversity.

22278222,Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) suppresses the induction of interferon by measles virus.,"ADAR1, the interferon (IFN)-inducible adenosine deaminase acting on RNA, catalyzes the C-6 deamination of adenosine (A) to produce inosine (I) in RNA substrates with a double-stranded character. Because double-stranded RNA is a known inducer of IFN, we tested the role of ADAR1 in IFN induction following virus infection. HeLa cells made stably deficient in ADAR1 (ADAR1(kd)) were compared to vector control (CON(kd)) and protein kinase PKR-deficient (PKR(kd)) cells for IFN-β induction following infection with either parental (wild-type [WT]) recombinant Moraten vaccine strain measles virus (MV) or isogenic knockout mutants deficient for either V (V(ko)) or C (C(ko)) protein expression. We observed potent IFN-β transcript induction in ADAR1(kd) cells by all three viruses; in contrast, in ADAR1-sufficient CON(kd) cells, only the C(ko) mutant virus was an effective inducer and the IFN-β RNA induction was amplified by PKR. The enhanced IFN-β transcript-inducing capacity of the WT and V(ko) viruses seen in ADAR1-deficient cells correlated with the enhanced activation of PKR, IFN regulatory factor IRF3, and activator of transcription ATF2, reaching levels similar to those seen in C(ko) virus-infected cells. However, the level of IFN-β protein produced was not proportional to the level of IFN-β RNA but rather correlated inversely with the level of activated PKR. These results suggest that ADAR1 functions as an important suppressor of MV-mediated responses, including the activation of PKR and IRF3 and the induction of IFN-β RNA. Our findings further implicate a balanced interplay between PKR and ADAR1 in modulating IFN-β protein production following virus infection.",2012 Apr,J Virol. 2012 Apr;86(7):3787-94. doi: 10.1128/JVI.06307-11.

22514516,The essential role of AMPA receptor GluR2 subunit RNA editing in the normal and diseased brain.,"α-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors are comprised of different combinations of GluA1-GluA4 (also known asGluR1-GluR4 and GluR-A to GluR-D) subunits. The GluA2 subunit is subject to RNA editing by the ADAR2 enzyme, which converts a codon for glutamine (Gln; Q), present in the GluA2 gene, to a codon for arginine (Arg; R) found in the mRNA. AMPA receptors are calcium (Ca(2+))-permeable if they contain the unedited GluA2(Q) subunit or if they lack the GluA2 subunit. While most AMPA receptors in the brain contain the edited GluA2(R) subunit and are therefore Ca(2+)-impermeable, recent evidence suggests that Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptors are important in synaptic plasticity, learning, and disease. Strong evidence supports the notion that Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptors are usually GluA2-lacking AMPA receptors, with little evidence to date for a significant role of unedited GluA2 in normal brain function. However, recent detailed studies suggest that Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptors containing unedited GluA2 do in fact occur in neurons and can contribute to excitotoxic cell loss, even where it was previously thought that there was no unedited GluA2.This review provides an update on the role of GluA2 RNA editing in the healthy and diseased brain and summarizes recent insights into the mechanisms that control this process. We suggest that further studies of the role of unedited GluA2 in normal brain function and disease are warranted, and that GluA2 editing should be considered as a possible contributing factor when Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptors are observed.",2012,Front Mol Neurosci. 2012 Apr 11;5:34. doi: 10.3389/fnmol.2012.00034. eCollection 2012.,"['Wright A', 'Vissel B']",False
22876301,Identification of novel deregulated RNA metabolism-related genes in non-small cell lung cancer.,"Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Several alterations in RNA metabolism have been found in lung cancer cells; this suggests that RNA metabolism-related molecules are involved in the development of this pathology. In this study, we searched for RNA metabolism-related genes that exhibit different expression levels between normal and tumor lung tissues. We identified eight genes differentially expressed in lung adenocarcinoma microarray datasets. Of these, seven were up-regulated whereas one was down-regulated. Interestingly, most of these genes had not previously been associated with lung cancer. These genes play diverse roles in mRNA metabolism: three are associated with the spliceosome (ASCL3L1, SNRPB and SNRPE), whereas others participate in RNA-related processes such as translation (MARS and MRPL3), mRNA stability (PCBPC1), mRNA transport (RAE), or mRNA editing (ADAR2, also known as ADARB1). Moreover, we found a high incidence of loss of heterozygosity at chromosome 21q22.3, where the ADAR2 locus is located, in NSCLC cell lines and primary tissues, suggesting that the downregulation of ADAR2 in lung cancer is associated with specific genetic losses. Finally, in a series of adenocarcinoma patients, the expression of five of the deregulated genes (ADAR2, MARS, RAE, SNRPB and SNRPE) correlated with prognosis. Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that changes in RNA metabolism are involved in the pathogenesis of lung cancer, and identify new potential targets for the treatment of this disease.",2012,PLoS One. 2012;7(8):e42086. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0042086.

Because TDP-43 pathology is found more frequently in the brains of elderly patients, we investigated the age-related changes in the TDP-43 localization and ADAR2 activity in mouse motor neurons. We found that ADAR2 was developmentally upregulated, and its mRNA expression level was progressively decreased in the spinal cords of aged mice. Motor neurons normally exhibit nuclear ADAR2 and TDP-43 immunoreactivity, whereas fast fatigable motor neurons in aged mice demonstrated a loss of ADAR2 and abnormal TDP-43 localization. Importantly, these motor neurons expressed significant amounts of the Q/R site-unedited AMPA receptor subunit 2 (GluA2) mRNA. Because expression of unedited GluA2 has been demonstrated as a lethality-causing molecular abnormality observed in the motor neurons, these results suggest that age-related decreases in ADAR2 activity play a mechanistic role in aging and serve as one of risk factors for ALS.",2012,PLoS One. 2012;7(8):e43469. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0043469.

Here we demonstrate that activation of calpain, a Ca2+-dependent cysteine protease, by upregulation of Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptors generates carboxy-terminal-cleaved TDP-43 fragments and causes mislocalization of TDP-43 in the motor neurons expressing glutamine/arginine site-unedited GluA2 of conditional ADAR2 knockout (AR2) mice that mimic the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis pathology. These abnormalities are inhibited in the AR2res mice that express Ca2+-impermeable AMPA receptors in the absence of ADAR2 and in the calpastatin transgenic mice, but are exaggerated in the calpastatin knockout mice. Additional demonstration of calpain-dependent TDP43 fragments in the spinal cord and brain of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients, and high vulnerability of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-linked mutant TDP43 to cleavage by calpain support the crucial role of the calpain-dependent cleavage of TDP43 in the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis pathology.",2012,Nat Commun. 2012;3:1307. doi: 10.1038/ncomms2303.,"['Yamashita T', 'Hideyama T', 'Hachiga K', 'Teramoto S', 'Takano J', 'Iwata N', 'Saido TC', 'Kwak S']",True
21732238,Control of ADAR1 editing of hepatitis delta virus RNAs.,"Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) uses ADAR1 editing of the viral antigenome RNA to switch from viral RNA replication to packaging. At early times in the replication cycle, the virus produces the protein HDAg-S, which is required for RNA synthesis; at later times, as result of editing at the amber/W site, the virus produces HDAg-L, which is required for packaging, but inhibits further RNA synthesis as levels increase. Control of editing during the replication cycle is essential for the virus and is multifaceted. Both the rate at which amber/W site editing occurs and the ultimate amount of editing are restricted; moreover, despite the nearly double stranded character of the viral RNA, efficient editing is restricted to the amber/W site. The mechanisms used by the virus for controlling editing operate at several levels, and range from molecular interactions to procedural. They include the placement of editing in the HDV replication cycle, RNA structural dynamics, and interactions of both ADAR1 and HDAg with specific structural features of the RNA. That HDV genotypes 1 and 3 use different RNA structural features for editing and control the process in ways related to these features underscores the critical roles of editing and its control in HDV replication. This review will cover the mechanisms of editing at the amber/W site and the means by which the virus controls it in these two genotypes.",2012,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol. 2012;353:123-43. doi: 10.1007/82_2011_146.,['Casey JL'],True
22969417,Dependencies among editing sites in serotonin 2C receptor mRNA.,"The serotonin 2C receptor (5-HT(2C)R)-a key regulator of diverse neurological processes-exhibits functional variability derived from editing of its pre-mRNA by site-specific adenosine deamination (A-to-I pre-mRNA editing) in five distinct sites. Here we describe a statistical technique that was developed for analysis of the dependencies among the editing states of the five sites. The statistical significance of the observed correlations was estimated by comparing editing patterns in multiple individuals. For both human and rat 5-HT(2C)R, the editing states of the physically proximal sites A and B were found to be strongly dependent. In contrast, the editing states of sites C and D, which are also physically close, seem not to be directly dependent but instead are linked through the dependencies on sites A and B, respectively. We observed pronounced differences between the editing patterns in humans and rats: in humans site A is the key determinant of the editing state of the other sites, whereas in rats this role belongs to site B. The structure of the dependencies among the editing sites is notably simpler in rats than it is in humans implying more complex regulation of 5-HT(2C)R editing and, by inference, function in the human brain. Thus, exhaustive statistical analysis of the 5-HT(2C)R editing patterns indicates that the editing state of sites A and B is the primary determinant of the editing states of the other three sites, and hence the overall editing pattern. Taken together, these findings allow us to propose a mechanistic model of concerted action of ADAR1 and ADAR2 in 5-HT(2C)R editing. Statistical approach developed here can be applied to other cases of interdependencies among modification sites in RNA and proteins.",2012,PLoS Comput Biol. 2012;8(9):e1002663. doi: 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002663.

21761288,Regulation and functions of ADAR in drosophila.,"Drosophila melanogaster has a single Adar gene encoding a protein related to mammalian ADAR2 that edits transcripts encoding glutamate receptor subunits. We describe the structure of the Drosophila Adar locus and use ModENCODE information to supplement published data on Adar gene transcription, and splicing. We discuss the roles of ADAR in Drosophila in terms of the two main types of RNA molecules edited and roles of ADARs as RNA-binding proteins. Site-specific RNA editing events in transcripts encoding ion channel subunits were initially found serendipitously and subsequent directed searches for editing sites and transcriptome sequencing have now led to 972 edited sites being identified in 597 transcripts. Four percent of D. melanogaster transcripts are site-specifically edited and these encode a wide range of largely membrane-associated proteins expressed particularly in CNS. Electrophysiological studies on the effects of specific RNA editing events on ion channel subunits do not suggest that loss of RNA editing events in ion channels consistently produce a particular outcome such as making Adar mutant neurons more excitable. This possibility would have been consistent with neurodegeneration seen in Adar mutant fly brains. A further set of ADAR targets are dsRNA intermediates in siRNA generation, derived from transposons and from structured RNA loci. Transcripts with convergent overlapping 3' ends are also edited and the first discovered instance of RNA editing in Drosophila, in the Rnp4F transcript, is an example. There is no evidence yet to show that Adar antagonizes RNA interference in Drosophila. Evidence has been obtained that catalytically inactive ADAR proteins exert effects on microRNA generation and RNA interference. Whether all effects of inactive ADARs are due to RNA-binding or to even further roles of these proteins remains to be determined.",2012,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol. 2012;353:221-36. doi: 10.1007/82_2011_152.,"['Paro S', 'Li X', ""O'Connell MA"", 'Keegan LP']",True

22524594,A comparative analysis to study editing of small noncoding BC200- and Alu transcripts in brain of prion-inoculated rhesus monkeys (M. Mulatta).,"Small retroelements (short interspersed elements, abbreviated SINEs) are abundant in vertebrate genomes. Using RNA isolated from rhesus monkey cerebellum and buffy coat, reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT PCR) was applied to clone cDNA of BC200 and Alu RNAs. Transcripts containing Alu-SINE sequences may be subjected to extensive RNA editing by ADAR (adenosine deaminases that act on RNA) deamination. Abundance of Alu transcripts was determined with real-time RT PCR and was significantly higher than BC200 (brain cytoplasmic) in cerebellum. BC200 transcripts were absent from buffy coat cells. Availability of the rhesus genome sequence allowed the BC200 transcripts to be mapped to the specific locus on chromosome 13. Both the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of BC 200 expression argue for the BC 200 transcripts being generated by RNA polymerase III. In cerebellum, Alu transcripts often possessed base exchanges (A to G) consistent with ADAR editing and, somewhat unexpectedly, C to T exchanges consistent with APOBEC (apolipoprotein B editing complex) editing. In contrast, the BC200 transcripts, which as RNA POLIII transcripts play a role in dendritic RNA translation, appeared not to be deaminated, despite the presence of editing of Alu in the same tissue. To assess whether neuronal disease might influence editing of BC200 and Alu-SINE transcripts in cerebellum, RNA was isolated from two rhesus monkeys that were inoculated with prions from human variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD). Regardless of prion-induced neurodegeneration, no BC200 RNA editing was observed, while Alu RNA continued to show both ADAR and APOBEC editing.

22859999,Altered A-to-I RNA editing in human embryogenesis.,"Post-transcriptional events play an important role in human development. The question arises as to whether Adenosine to Inosine RNA editing, catalyzed by the ADAR (Adenosine Deaminase acting on RNA) enzymes, differs in human embryogenesis and in adulthood. We tested the editing of various target genes in coding (FLNA, BLCAP, CYFIP2) and non-coding sequences at their Alu elements (BRCA1, CARD11, RBBP9, MDM4, FNACC), as well as the transcriptional levels of the ADAR1 enzymes. This analysis was performed on five fetal and adult human tissues: brain, heart, liver, kidney, and spleen, as well as on human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), which represent the blastocyst stage in early human development. Our results show substantially greater editing activity for most adult tissue samples relative to fetal ones, in six of the eight genes tested. To test the effect of reduced A-to-I RNA editing activity in early human development we used human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) as a model and tried to generate hESC clones that overexpress the ADAR1-p110 isoform. We were unable to achieve overexpression of ADAR1-p110 by either transfection or lentiviral infection, though we easily generated hESC clones that expressed the GFP transgene and overexpressed ADAR1-p110 in 293T cells and in primary human foreskin fibroblast (HFF) cells. Moreover, in contrast to the expected overexpression of ADAR1-p110 protein following its introduction into hESCs, the expression levels of this protein decreased dramatically 24-48 hr post infection. Similar results were obtained when we tried to overexpress ADAR1-p110 in pluripotent embryonal carcinoma cells. This suggests that ADAR1 protein is substantially regulated in undifferentiated pluripotent hESCs.

Mutation of rpoN, encoding sigma factor N (σ(N)), dramatically alters the growth-phase dependent regulation of both acid resistance and the LEE. This study reports on the determinants of σ(N)-directed acid resistance and LEE expression, and the underlying mechanism attributable to this phenotype. Glutamate-dependent acid resistance (GDAR) in TW14359ΔrpoN correlated with increased expression of the gadX-gadW regulatory circuit during exponential growth, whereas upregulation of arginine-dependent acid resistance (ADAR) genes adiA and adiC in TW14359ΔrpoN did not confer acid resistance by the ADAR mechanism. LEE regulatory (ler), structural (espA and cesT) and effector (tir) genes were downregulated in TW14359ΔrpoN, and mutation of rpoS encoding sigma factor 38 (σ(S)) in TW14359ΔrpoN restored acid resistance and LEE genes to WT levels. Stability, but not the absolute level, of σ(S) was increased in TW14359ΔrpoN; however, increased stability was not solely attributable to the GDAR and LEE expression phenotype. Complementation of TW14359ΔrpoN with a σ(N) allele that binds RNA polymerase (RNAP) but not DNA, did not restore WT levels of σ(S) stability, gadE, ler or GDAR, indicating a dependence on transcription from a σ(N) promoter(s) and not RNAP competition for the phenotype. Among a library of σ(N) enhancer binding protein mutants, only TW14359ΔntrC, inactivated for nitrogen regulatory protein NtrC, phenocopied TW14359ΔrpoN for σ(S) stability, GDAR and ler expression. The results of this study suggest that during exponential growth, NtrC-σ(N) regulate GDAR and LEE expression through downregulation of σ(S) at the post-translational level; likely by altering σ(S) stability or activity.

23139803,c-Jun amino-terminal kinase-1 mediates glucose-responsive upregulation of the RNA editing enzyme ADAR2 in pancreatic beta-cells.,"A-to-I RNA editing catalyzed by the two main members of the adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) family, ADAR1 and ADAR2, represents a RNA-based recoding mechanism implicated in a variety of cellular processes. Previously we have demonstrated that the expression of ADAR2 in pancreatic islet β-cells is responsive to the metabolic cues and ADAR2 deficiency affects regulated cellular exocytosis. To investigate the molecular mechanism by which ADAR2 is metabolically regulated, we found that in cultured β-cells and primary islets, the stress-activated protein kinase JNK1 mediates the upregulation of ADAR2 in response to changes of the nutritional state. In parallel with glucose induction of ADAR2 expression, JNK phosphorylation was concurrently increased in insulin-secreting INS-1 β-cells. Pharmacological inhibition of JNKs or siRNA knockdown of the expression of JNK1 prominently suppressed glucose-augmented ADAR2 expression, resulting in decreased efficiency of ADAR2 auto-editing. Consistently, the mRNA expression of Adar2 was selectively reduced in the islets from JNK1 null mice in comparison with that of wild-type littermates or JNK2 null mice, and ablation of JNK1 diminished high-fat diet-induced Adar2 expression in the islets from JNK1 null mice. Furthermore, promoter analysis of the mouse Adar2 gene identified a glucose-responsive region and revealed the transcription factor c-Jun as a driver of Adar2 transcription. Taken together, these results demonstrate that JNK1 serves as a crucial component in mediating glucose-responsive upregulation of ADAR2 expression in pancreatic β-cells. Thus, the JNK1 pathway may be functionally linked to the nutrient-sensing actions of ADAR2-mediated RNA editing in professional secretory cells.",2012,PLoS One. 2012;7(11):e48611. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0048611.

23346095,Dysregulated A to I RNA editing and non-coding RNAs in neurodegeneration.,"RNA editing is an alteration in the primary nucleotide sequences resulting from a chemical change in the base. RNA editing is observed in eukaryotic mRNA, transfer RNA, ribosomal RNA, and non-coding RNAs (ncRNA). The most common RNA editing in the mammalian central nervous system is a base modification, where the adenosine residue is base-modified to inosine (A to I). Studies from ADAR (adenosine deaminase that act on RNA) mutants in Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila, and mice clearly show that the RNA editing process is an absolute requirement for nervous system homeostasis and normal physiology of the animal. Understanding the mechanisms of editing and findings of edited substrates has provided a better knowledge of the phenotype due to defective and hyperactive RNA editing. A to I RNA editing is catalyzed by a family of enzymes knows as ADARs. ADARs modify duplex RNAs and editing of duplex RNAs formed by ncRNAs can impact RNA functions, leading to an altered regulatory gene network. Such altered functions by A to I editing is observed in mRNAs, microRNAs (miRNA) but other editing of small and long ncRNAs (lncRNAs) has yet to be identified. Thus, ncRNA and RNA editing may provide key links between neural development, nervous system function, and neurological diseases. This review includes a summary of seminal findings regarding the impact of ncRNAs on biological and pathological processes, which may be further modified by RNA editing. NcRNAs are non-translated RNAs classified by size and function. Known ncRNAs like miRNAs, smallRNAs (smRNAs), PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), and lncRNAs play important roles in splicing, DNA methylation, imprinting, and RNA interference. Of note, miRNAs are involved in development and function of the nervous system that is heavily dependent on both RNA editing and the intricate spatiotemporal expression of ncRNAs. This review focuses on the impact of dysregulated A to I editing and ncRNAs in neurodegeneration.",2012,Front Genet. 2013 Jan 22;3:326. doi: 10.3389/fgene.2012.00326. eCollection 2012.,['Singh M'],True

To define and characterize such substrates, we examined small RNA and mRNA populations of ADAR mutants and identified a distinct set of loci from which RNAi-dependent short RNAs are markedly upregulated. At these same loci, we observed populations of multiply edited transcripts, supporting a specific role for ADARs in preventing access to the RNAi pathway for an extensive population of dsRNAs. Characterization of these loci revealed a substantial overlap with noncoding and intergenic regions, suggesting that the landscape of ADAR targets may extend beyond previously annotated classes of transcripts.",2011 Sep 11,Nat Struct Mol Biol. 2011 Sep 11;18(10):1094-101. doi: 10.1038/nsmb.2129.,"['Wu D', 'Lamm AT', 'Fire AZ']",True
21622951,Functional conservation in human and Drosophila of Metazoan ADAR2 involved in RNA editing: loss of ADAR1 in insects.,"Flies with mutations in the single Drosophila Adar gene encoding an RNA editing enzyme involved in editing 4% of all transcripts have severe locomotion defects and develop age-dependent neurodegeneration. Vertebrates have two ADAR-editing enzymes that are catalytically active; ADAR1 and ADAR2. We show that human ADAR2 rescues Drosophila Adar mutant phenotypes. Neither the short nuclear ADAR1p110 isoform nor the longer interferon-inducible cytoplasmic ADAR1p150 isoform rescue walking defects efficiently, nor do they correctly edit specific sites in Drosophila transcripts. Surprisingly, human ADAR1p110 does suppress age-dependent neurodegeneration in Drosophila Adar mutants whereas ADAR1p150 does not. The single Drosophila Adar gene was previously assumed to represent an evolutionary ancestor of the multiple vertebrate ADARs. The strong functional similarity of human ADAR2 and Drosophila Adar suggests rather that these are true orthologs. By a combination of direct cloning and searching new invertebrate genome sequences we show that distinct ADAR1 and ADAR2 genes were present very early in the Metazoan lineage, both occurring before the split between the Bilateria and Cnidarians. The ADAR1 gene has been lost several times, including during the evolution of insects and crustacea. These data complement our rescue results, supporting the idea that ADAR1 and ADAR2 have evolved highly conserved, distinct functions.",2011 Sep 1,Nucleic Acids Res. 2011 Sep 1;39(16):7249-62. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkr423.

21490091,Enhancement of replication of RNA viruses by ADAR1 via RNA editing and inhibition of RNA-activated protein kinase.,"Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) is a double-stranded RNA binding protein and RNA-editing enzyme that modifies cellular and viral RNAs, including coding and noncoding RNAs. This interferon (IFN)-induced protein was expected to have an antiviral role, but recent studies have demonstrated that it promotes the replication of many RNA viruses. The data from these experiments show that ADAR1 directly enhances replication of hepatitis delta virus, human immunodeficiency virus type 1, vesicular stomatitis virus, and measles virus. The proviral activity of ADAR1 occurs through two mechanisms: RNA editing and inhibition of RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR). While these pathways have been found independently, the two mechanisms can act in concert to increase viral replication and contribute to viral pathogenesis. This novel type of proviral regulation by an IFN-induced protein, combined with some antiviral effects of hyperediting, sheds new light on the importance of ADAR1 during viral infection and transforms our overall understanding of the innate immune response.",2011 Sep,J Virol. 2011 Sep;85(17):8460-6. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00240-11.

METHODS: We performed reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to assess mRNA expression. We analyzed RNA editing with amplification refractory mutation system PCR and complementary DNA sequencing. Protein expression and ERK phosphorylation were assessed using Western blots. We studied gene silencing with specific small interfering RNAs (siRNA), and we studied intracellular Ca(2+) using fluorometry. RESULTS: All GluK subunits were present in the brain in vivo, and GluK2-5 subunits were present in cultured astrocytes. Fluoxetine upregulated GluK2 and ADAR2. Enhanced GluK2 editing by fluoxetine abolished glutamate-mediated increases in intra cellular Ca(2+) and ERK(1/2) phosphorylation. Enhanced editing of GluK2 was prevented by siRNA against the 5-HT(2B) receptor or ADAR2. LIMITATIONS: Limitations of our study include the use of an in vitro system, but our cultured cells in many respects behave like in vivo astrocytes. CONCLUSION: Fluoxetine alters astrocytic glutamatergic function.",2011 Sep,J Psychiatry Neurosci. 2011 Sep;36(5):322-38. doi: 10.1503/jpn.100094.,"['Li B', 'Zhang S', 'Zhang H', 'Hertz L', 'Peng L']",True

Thus, the present study aimed to identify and characterize areas for marine shrimp farming located in the Southern portion of the Patos Lagoon estuary (32º00'S 52º00'W) by employing the analysis of satellite remote sensing (Landsat TM and ETM+/Google Earth), airborne remote sensing (35mm system ADAR 1000), terrestrial remote sensing (RICOH 500SE), and field expeditions, integrating data in a Geographical Information System (IDRISI Andes). As a result, the enterprises were built on coastal fields or in obliterated dune areas, which are favorable for cultivation. The proximity of possible consuming markets and local labor, relatively good access roads and local technical support also favor the projects. However, there must be caution in terms of changes in the original projects, which could cause environmental impacts and noncompliance of environmental norms, such as the occupation of salt marsh areas.

21866960,Comparative characterization of fungal anthracenone and naphthacenedione biosynthetic pathways reveals an α-hydroxylation-dependent Claisen-like cyclization catalyzed by a dimanganese thioesterase.,"The linear tetracyclic TAN-1612 (1) and BMS-192548 (2) were isolated from different filamentous fungal strains and have been examined as potential neuropeptide Y and neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists, respectively. Although the biosynthesis of fungal aromatic polyketides has attracted much interest in recent years, the biosynthetic mechanism for such naphthacenedione-containing products has not been established. Using a targeted genome mining approach, we first located the ada gene cluster responsible for the biosynthesis of 1 in Aspergillus niger ATCC 1015. The connection between 1 and the ada pathway was verified through overexpression of the Zn(2)Cys(6)-type pathway-specific transcriptional regulator AdaR and subsequent gene expression analysis. The enzymes encoded in the ada gene cluster share high sequence similarities to the known apt pathway linked to the biosynthesis of anthraquinone asperthecin 3. Subsequent comparative investigation of these two highly homologous gene clusters by heterologous pathway reconstitution in Saccharomyces cerevisiae revealed a novel α-hydroxylation-dependent Claisen cyclization cascade, which involves a flavin-dependent monooxygenase that hydroxylates the α-carbon of an acyl carrier protein-bound polyketide and a bifunctional metallo-β-lactamase-type thioesterase (MβL-TE). The bifunctional MβL-TE catalyzes the fourth ring cyclization to afford the naphthacenedione scaffold upon α-hydroxylation, whereas it performs hydrolytic release of an anthracenone product in the absence of α-hydroxylation. Through in vitro biochemical characterizations and metal analyses, we verified that the apt MβL-TE is a dimanganese enzyme and requires both Mn(2+) cations for the observed activities. The MβL-TE is the first example of a thioesterase in polyketide biosynthesis that catalyzes the Claisen-like condensation without an α/β hydrolase fold and forms no covalent bond with the substrate. These mechanistic features should be general to the biosynthesis of tetracyclic naphthacenedione compounds in fungi.",2011 Oct 5,J Am Chem Soc. 2011 Oct 5;133(39):15773-85. doi: 10.1021/ja206906d.

The protein encoded by this locus (FMRP) is an RNA-binding protein that is thought to primarily act as a translational regulator; however, recent studies have implicated FMRP in other mechanisms of gene regulation. We found that the Drosophila fragile X homolog (dFMR1) biochemically interacted with the adenosine-to-inosine RNA-editing enzyme dADAR. Adar and Fmr1 mutant larvae exhibited distinct morphological neuromuscular junction (NMJ) defects. Epistasis experiments based on these phenotypic differences revealed that Adar acts downstream of Fmr1 and that dFMR1 modulates dADAR activity. Furthermore, sequence analyses revealed that a loss or overexpression of dFMR1 affects editing efficiency on certain dADAR targets with defined roles in synaptic transmission. These results link dFMR1 with the RNA-editing pathway and suggest that proper NMJ synaptic architecture requires modulation of dADAR activity by dFMR1.",2011 Oct 30,Nat Neurosci. 2011 Oct 30;14(12):1517-24. doi: 10.1038/nn.2950.,"['Bhogal B', 'Jepson JE', 'Savva YA', 'Pepper AS', 'Reenan RA', 'Jongens TA']",True

21924887,Protein kinase PKR and RNA adenosine deaminase ADAR1: new roles for old players as modulators of the interferon response.,"Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) plays a centrally important role in antiviral innate immunity, both for the production of interferon (IFN) and also in the actions of IFN. Among the IFN-inducible gene products are the protein kinase regulated by RNA (PKR) and the adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1). PKR is an established key player in the antiviral actions of IFN, through dsRNA-dependent activation and subsequent phosphorylation of protein synthesis initiation factor eIF2α thereby altering the translational pattern in cells. In addition, PKR plays an important role as a positive effector that amplifies the production of IFN. ADAR1 catalyzes the deamination of adenosine (A) in RNA with double-stranded (ds) character, leading to the destabilization of RNA duplex structures and genetic recoding. By contrast to the antiviral and proapoptotic functions associated with PKR, the actions of ADAR1 in some instances are proviral and cell protective as ADAR1 functions as a suppressor of dsRNA-mediated antiviral responses including activation of PKR and interferon regulatory factor 3.",2011 Oct,Curr Opin Immunol. 2011 Oct;23(5):573-82. doi: 10.1016/j.coi.2011.08.009.

21720910,Increased RNA editing in children with cyanotic congenital heart disease.,"PURPOSE: To test the hypothesis that RNA editing is altered in pediatric patients with cyanotic congenital heart disease (CHD) and to determine whether A-to-I RNA editing is associated with the postoperative course following cardiac surgery. Cyanotic CHD is associated with a unique pathophysiology caused by chronic hypoxia. The perioperative course of cyanotic infants is partly dictated by the degree of expression of inflammatory and cardiac genes, some of which undergo A-to-I RNA editing. METHODS: RNA was extracted pre- and postoperatively from blood samples of cyanotic and acyanotic patients. Each sample was analyzed for A-to-I RNA editing using automatic DNA sequencing of an intronic segment of the MED13 gene. RNA expression levels of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) enzymes responsible for RNA editing were examined by quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: A-to-I RNA editing in MED13 was significantly higher among cyanotic patients (n = 19) than acyanotic ones (n = 18) both pre- and postoperatively, as manifested by average editing at seven highly edited sites (27.4 ± 8.5% versus 20.8 ± 10.2%; P = 0.038) and editing at specific sites, e.g., position 14 (20.2 ± 5.1% versus 14.5 ± 5.2%; P = 0.002). Cyanotic patients exhibited a more complicated postoperative course than acyanotic patients. ADAR2 RNA levels were significantly lower among cyanotic patients.

22028664,Identification of widespread ultra-edited human RNAs.,"Adenosine-to-inosine modification of RNA molecules (A-to-I RNA editing) is an important mechanism that increases transciptome diversity. It occurs when a genomically encoded adenosine (A) is converted to an inosine (I) by ADAR proteins. Sequencing reactions read inosine as guanosine (G); therefore, current methods to detect A-to-I editing sites align RNA sequences to their corresponding DNA regions and identify A-to-G mismatches. However, such methods perform poorly on RNAs that underwent extensive editing (""ultra""-editing), as the large number of mismatches obscures the genomic origin of these RNAs. Therefore, only a few anecdotal ultra-edited RNAs have been discovered so far. Here we introduce and apply a novel computational method to identify ultra-edited RNAs. We detected 760 ESTs containing 15,646 editing sites (more than 20 sites per EST, on average), of which 13,668 are novel. Ultra-edited RNAs exhibit the known sequence motif of ADARs and tend to localize in sense strand Alu elements. Compared to sites of mild editing, ultra-editing occurs primarily in Alu-rich regions, where potential base pairing with neighboring, inverted Alus creates particularly long double-stranded RNA structures. Ultra-editing sites are underrepresented in old Alu subfamilies, tend to be non-conserved, and avoid exons, suggesting that ultra-editing is usually deleterious. A possible biological function of ultra-editing could be mediated by non-canonical splicing and cleavage of the RNA near the editing sites.",2011 Oct,PLoS Genet. 2011 Oct;7(10):e1002317. doi: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1002317.

Two types of adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing have been defined: site selective and hyper-editing. Typically, in site selectively edited substrates, one or a few A-to-I sites are edited in double-stranded RNA structures, frequently interrupted by single-stranded bulges and loops. Hyper-editing occurs in long stretches of duplex RNA where multiple adenosines are subjected to deamination. In this review, recent findings on editing within noncoding RNA as well as examples of site selective editing within coding regions are presented.

We genotyped and analyzed 307 common candidate tagSNPs from 12 antiviral genes in a cohort of 745 schoolchildren immunized with two doses of measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. Associations between SNPs/haplotypes and measles virus-specific immune outcomes were assessed using linear regression methodologies in Caucasians and African-Americans. Genetic variants within the DDX58/RIG-I gene, including a coding polymorphism (rs3205166/Val800Val), were associated as single-SNPs (p≤0.017; although these SNPs did not remain significant after correction for false discovery rate/FDR) and in haplotype-level analysis, with measles-specific antibody variations in Caucasians (haplotype allele p-value=0.021; haplotype global p-value=0.076). Four DDX58 polymorphisms, in high LD, demonstrated also associations (after correction for FDR) with variations in both measles-specific IFN-γ and IL-2 secretion in Caucasians (p≤0.001, q=0.193). Two intronic OAS1 polymorphisms, including the functional OAS1 SNP rs10774671 (p=0.003), demonstrated evidence of association with a significant allele-dose-related increase in neutralizing antibody levels in African-Americans.

After correction for FDR, 15 single-SNP associations (11 SNPs in Caucasians and 4 SNPs in African-Americans) still remained significant at the q-value<0.20.

Discoveries in the last decade completely changed our view on RNA. We now realize that its diversity lies at the base of biological complexity. Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing emerges a central generator of transcriptome diversity and regulation in higher eukaryotes. It is the posttranscriptional deamination of adenosine to inosine in double-stranded RNA catalyzed by enzymes of the adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) family. Thought at first to be restricted to coding regions of only a few genes, recent bioinformatic analyses fueled by high-throughput sequencing revealed that it is a widespread modification affecting mostly non-coding repetitive elements in thousands of genes. The rise in scope is accompanied by discovery of a growing repertoire of functions based on differential decoding of inosine by the various cellular machineries: when recognized as guanosine, it can lead to protein recoding, alternative splicing or altered microRNA specificity; when recognized by inosine-binding proteins, it can result in nuclear retention of the transcript or its degradation. An imbalance in expression of ADAR enzymes with consequent editing dysregulation is a characteristic of human cancers. These alterations may be responsible for activating proto-oncogenes or inactivating tumor suppressors. While unlikely to be an early initiating 'hit', editing dysregulation seems to contribute to tumor progression and thus should be considered a 'driver mutation'.

In mammals there are three ADAR genes. Two encode proteins that possess demonstrated deaminase activity: ADAR1, which is interferon-inducible, and ADAR2 which is constitutively expressed. ADAR3, by contrast, has not yet been shown to be an active enzyme. The specificity of the ADAR1 and ADAR2 deaminases ranges from highly site-selective to non-selective, dependent on the duplex structure of the substrate RNA. A-to-I editing is a form of nucleotide substitution editing, because I is decoded as guanosine (G) instead of A by ribosomes during translation and by polymerases during RNA-dependent RNA replication. Additionally, A-to-I editing can alter RNA structure stability as I:U mismatches are less stable than A:U base pairs. Both viral and cellular RNAs are edited by ADARs. A-to-I editing is of broad physiologic significance.

21078670,Engineered alterations in RNA editing modulate complex behavior in Drosophila: regulatory diversity of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) targets.,"Select proteins involved in electrical and chemical neurotransmission are re-coded at the RNA level via the deamination of particular adenosines to inosine by adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs). It has been hypothesized that this process, termed RNA editing, acts to ""fine-tune"" neurophysiological properties in animals and potentially downstream behavioral outputs. However, the extreme phenotypes resulting from deletions of adar loci have precluded investigations into the relationship between ADAR levels, target transcripts, and complex behaviors. Here, we engineer Drosophila hypomorphic for ADAR expression using homologous recombination. A substantial reduction in ADAR activity (>80%) leads to altered circadian motor patterns and abnormal male courtship, although surprisingly, general locomotor coordination is spared. The altered phenotypic landscape in our adar hypomorph is paralleled by an unexpected dichotomous response of ADAR target transcripts, i.e. certain adenosines are minimally affected by dramatic ADAR reduction, whereas editing of others is severely curtailed. Furthermore, we use a novel reporter to map RNA editing activity across the nervous system, and we demonstrate that knockdown of editing in fruitless-expressing neurons is sufficient to modify the male courtship song. Our data demonstrate that network-wide temporal and spatial regulation of ADAR activity can tune the complex system of RNA-editing sites and modulate multiple ethologically relevant behavioral modalities.",2011 Mar 11,J Biol Chem. 2011 Mar 11;286(10):8325-8337. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M110.186817.

It was suggested that the unique acid tolerance of Shigella boydii 18 CDPH, the strain implicated in a 1998 outbreak, may have played an important role in surviving the acidic food (bean salad). The strain was capable of inducing arginine-dependent acid-resistance (ADAR) pathway. This pathway was assumed to be absent in Shigella sp. Here, we have examined occurrence and efficacy of ADAR pathway in 21 S. boydii strains obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) along with strains of S. flexneri (n = 7), S. sonnei (n = 4), and S. dysenteriae (n = 2). The eight S. boydii strains were able to induce ADAR to survive the acid challenge at pH 2.0; additional 8 strains could tolerate acid challenge at pH 2.5 but not at pH 2.0. The remaining five S. boydii strains were not able to induce ADAR pathway and could not survive acid challenge even at pH 2.5. ADAR pathway also appears to be present in all four Shigella sp.

BMMNC were isolated at different stages of disease and CD45.2(+)GFP(+) leukemia cells were sorted by flow cytometry at late stage. The expression of ADAR1 was detected by real time quantitative PCR. The results showed that mouse bone marrow cells from both leukemia and control groups expressed P110 and P150. Difference of P110 and P150 mRNA expression were observed during the development of leukemia. The expression of P110 dramatically increased and was significantly higher than that in control group. However, the expression level of P150 in leukemia group decreased stably and reached one-fourth of that in control group at 14 day. Furthermore, similar expression patterns could be detected in sorted CD45.2(+)GFP(+) leukemia cells.

21173229,RNA editing enzyme adenosine deaminase is a restriction factor for controlling measles virus replication that also is required for embryogenesis.,"Measles virus (MV), a member of the family Paramyxoviridae and an exclusively human pathogen, is among the most infectious viruses. A progressive fatal neurodegenerative complication, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), occurs during persistent MV infection of the CNS and is associated with biased hypermutations of the viral genome. The observed hypermutations of A-to-G are consistent with conversions catalyzed by the adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR1). To evaluate the role of ADAR1 in MV infection, we selectively disrupted expression of the IFN-inducible p150 ADAR1 isoform and found it caused embryonic lethality at embryo day (E) 11-E12. We therefore generated p150-deficient and WT mouse embryo fibroblast (MEF) cells stably expressing the MV receptor signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM or CD150). The p150(-/-) but not WT MEF cells displayed extensive syncytium formation and cytopathic effect (CPE) following infection with MV, consistent with an anti-MV role of the p150 isoform of ADAR1. MV titers were 3 to 4 log higher in p150(-/-) cells compared with WT cells at 21 h postinfection, and restoration of ADAR1 in p150(-/-) cells prevented MV cytopathology. In contrast to infection with MV, p150 disruption had no effect on vesicular stomatitis virus, reovirus, or lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus replication but protected against CPE resulting from infection with Newcastle disease virus, Sendai virus, canine distemper virus, and influenza A virus. Thus, ADAR1 is a restriction factor in the replication of paramyxoviruses and orthomyxoviruses.",2011 Jan 4,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2011 Jan 4;108(1):331-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1017241108.

21173277,Z-DNA-forming silencer in the first exon regulates human ADAM-12 gene expression.,"Upregulation of ADAM-12, a novel member of the multifunctional ADAM family of proteins is linked to cancer, arthritis and cardiac hypertrophy. Basal expression of ADAM-12 is very low in adult tissues but rises markedly in response to certain physiological cues, such as during pregnancy in the placenta, during development in neonatal skeletal muscle and bone and in regenerating muscle. Studies on ADAM-12 regulation have identified a highly conserved negative regulatory element (NRE) at the 5'-UTR of human ADAM-12 gene, which acts as a transcriptional repressor. The NRE contains a stretch of dinucleotide-repeat sequence that is able to adopt a Z-DNA conformation both in vitro and in vivo and interacts with hZα(ADAR1), a bona fide Z-DNA-binding protein. Substitution of the dinucleotide-repeat-element with a non-Z-DNA-forming sequence inhibited NRE function. We have detected a NRE DNA-binding protein activity in several tissues where ADAM-12 expression is low while no such activity was seen in the placenta where ADAM-12 expression is high. These observations suggest that interaction of these proteins with ADAM-12 NRE is critical for transcriptional repression of ADAM-12. We also show that the Z-DNA forming transcriptional repressor element, by interacting with these putative Z-DNA-binding proteins, is involved in the maintenance of constitutive low-level expression of human ADAM-12. Together these results provide a foundation for therapeutic down-regulation of ADAM-12 in cancer, arthritis and cardiac hypertrophy.",2011 Jan 4,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2011 Jan 4;108(1):103-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1008831108.

21294215,Multiple levels of PKR inhibition during HIV-1 replication.,"Recent therapeutic approaches against HIV-1 include IFN in combination therapy for patients with coinfections or as an alternative strategy against the virus. These treatment options require a better understanding of the weak efficacy of the IFN-stimulated genes, such as the protein kinase RNA-activated (PKR), which results in viral progression. Activated PKR has a strong antiviral activity on HIV-1 expression and production in cell culture. However, PKR is not activated upon HIV-1 infection when the virus reaches high levels of replication, due to viral and cellular controls. PKR is activated by low levels of the HIV-1 trans-activation response (TAR) RNA element, but is inhibited by high levels of this double-stranded RNA. The viral Tat protein also counteracts PKR activation by several mechanisms. In addition, HIV-1 replicates only in cells that have a high level of the TAR RNA binding protein (TRBP), a strong inhibitor of PKR activation. Furthermore, increased levels of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR1) are observed when HIV-1 replicates at high levels and the protein binds to PKR and inhibits its activation. Finally, the PKR activator (PACT) also binds to PKR during HIV-1 replication with no subsequent kinase activation. The combination of all the inhibiting pathways that prevent PKR phosphorylation contributes to a high HIV-1 production in permissive cells. Enhancing PKR activation by counteracting its inhibitory partners could establish an increased innate immune antiviral pathway against HIV-1 and could enhance the efficacy of the IFN treatment.",2011 Jan,Rev Med Virol. 2011 Jan;21(1):42-53. doi: 10.1002/rmv.674.

A-to-I RNA editing results in nucleotide substitution, because I is recognized as G instead of A both by ribosomes and by RNA polymerases. A-to-I substitution can also cause dsRNA destabilization, as I:U mismatch base pairs are less stable than A:U base pairs. Three mammalian ADAR genes are known, of which two encode active deaminases (ADAR1 and ADAR2). Alternative promoters together with alternative splicing give rise to two protein size forms of ADAR1: an interferon-inducible ADAR1-p150 deaminase that binds dsRNA and Z-DNA, and a constitutively expressed ADAR1-p110 deaminase. ADAR2, like ADAR1-p110, is constitutively expressed and binds dsRNA. A-to-I editing occurs with both viral and cellular RNAs, and affects a broad range of biological processes. These include virus growth and persistence, apoptosis and embryogenesis, neurotransmitter receptor and ion channel function, pancreatic cell function, and post-transcriptional gene regulation by microRNAs. Biochemical processes that provide a framework for understanding the physiologic changes following ADAR-catalyzed A-to-I ( = G) editing events include mRNA translation by changing codons and hence the amino acid sequence of proteins; pre-mRNA splicing by altering splice site recognition sequences; RNA stability by changing sequences involved in nuclease recognition; genetic stability in the case of RNA virus genomes by changing sequences during viral RNA replication; and RNA-structure-dependent activities such as microRNA production or targeting or protein-RNA interactions.",2011 Jan,J Interferon Cytokine Res. 2011 Jan;31(1):99-117. doi: 10.1089/jir.2010.0097.

In this present study, the molecular recognition between a variety of RNAs that are mutated around the C·A loop and the ligand was investigated. Studies show that both loop nucleotides and loop closing pairs affect binding affinity. Most interestingly, it was shown that there is a correlation between the thermodynamic stability of the C·A internal loops and ligand affinity. Specifically, C·A loops that had relatively high or low stability bound the ligand most weakly whereas loops with intermediate stability bound the ligand most tightly. In contrast, there is no correlation between the likelihood that a loop forms a C-A(+) pair at lower pH and ligand affinity. It was also found that a 1x1 nucleotide C·A loop that bound to the ligand with the highest affinity is identical to the consensus site in RNAs that are edited by adenosine deaminases acting on RNA type 2 (ADAR2).

21620933,"Exposure of neurons to excitotoxic levels of glutamate induces cleavage of the RNA editing enzyme, adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 2, and loss of GLUR2 editing.","AMPA receptors are glutamate receptors that are tetramers of various combinations of GluR1-4 subunits. AMPA receptors containing GluR1, 3 and 4 are Ca2+ permeable, however, AMPA receptors containing even a single subunit of GluR2 are Ca2+ impermeable. Most AMPA receptors are Ca2+ impermeable due to the presence of GluR2. GluR2 confers special properties on AMPA receptors through the presence of arginine at the pore apex; other subunits (GluR1, 3, 4) contain glutamine at the pore apex and allow Ca2+ influx. Normally, an RNA editing step changes DNA-encoded glutamine to arginine, introduces arginine in the GluR2 pore apex. GluR2 RNA editing is carried out by an RNA-dependent adenosine deaminase (ADAR2). Loss of GluR2 editing leads to the formation of highly excitotoxic AMPA channels [Mahajan and Ziff (2007) Mol Cell Neurosci 35:470-481] and is shown to contribute to loss of motor neurons in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Relatively higher levels of Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptors are found in motor neurons and this has been correlated with lower GluR2 mRNA levels. However, the reason for loss of GluR2 editing is not known. Here we show that exposure of neurons to excitotoxic levels of glutamate leads to specific cleavage of ADAR2 that leads to generation of unedited GluR2. We demonstrate that cleaved ADAR2 leads to a decrease or loss of GluR2 editing, which will further result in high Ca2+ influx and excitotoxic neuronal death.",2011 Aug 25,Neuroscience. 2011 Aug 25;189:305-15. doi: 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2011.05.027.

Among ADAR2 substrates this is the vital one as editing at this position is indispensable for normal brain function. However, the regulation of ADAR2 post-translationally remains to be elucidated. We demonstrate that the phosphorylation-dependent prolyl-isomerase Pin1 interacts with ADAR2 and is a positive regulator required for the nuclear localization and stability of ADAR2. Pin1(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts show mislocalization of ADAR2 in the cytoplasm and reduced editing at the GluR2 Q/R and R/G sites. The E3 ubiquitin ligase WWP2 plays a negative role by binding to ADAR2 and catalysing its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. Therefore, ADAR2 protein levels and catalytic activity are coordinately regulated in a positive manner by Pin1 and negatively by WWP2 and this may have downstream effects on the function of GluR2. Pin1 and WWP2 also regulate the large subunit of RNA Pol II, so these proteins may also coordinately regulate other key cellular proteins.",2011 Aug 16,EMBO J. 2011 Aug 16;30(20):4211-22. doi: 10.1038/emboj.2011.303.,"['Marcucci R', 'Brindle J', 'Paro S', 'Casadio A', 'Hempel S', 'Morrice N', 'Bisso A', 'Keegan LP', 'Del Sal G', ""O'Connell MA""]",True

These two editases share many common features in their protein structures, catalytic activities, and substrate requirements. However, the phenotypes of the knockout animals are remarkably different, which indicate the distinct functions they play. The most striking effect of ADAR1 knockout is cell death and interruption of embryonic development that are not observed in ADAR2 knockout. Evidences have shown that ADAR1 plays critical roles in the differentiating cells in embryo and adult tissues to support the cell's survival and permit their further differentiation and maturation. However, our knowledge in understanding of the mechanism by which ADAR1 exerts its unique effects is very limited. Many efforts had been made trying to understand why ADAR1 is so important that it is indispensible for animal survival, including studies that identify the RNA editing substrates and studies on non-editing mechanisms. The interest of this review is focused on the question why ADAR1 and not ADAR2 is required for cell survival. Therefore, only the data, published and unpublished, potentially connecting ADAR1 to its cell death effect is selectively cited and discussed here.

Previously, we observed enhanced endogenous behavioral despair in ADAR2 transgenic mice. As the transcript of the 5HT(2C) R is a substrate of ADAR2, we hypothesized that perturbed ADAR2 equilibrium in the prefrontal cortex of ADAR2 transgenic mice alters the normal distribution of edited amino acid isoforms of the 5HT(2C) R and modifies the receptor function in downstream basal extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling. We examined groups of naive control and ADAR2 transgenic mice and found significantly increased ADAR2 expression, increased RNA editing at A, C, D and E sites and significantly altered normal distribution of edited amino acid isoforms of the 5HT(2C) R with increased proportions of valine asparagine valine, valine serine valine, valine asparagine isoleucine, isoleucine asparagine valine and decreased isoleucine asparagine isoleucine amino acid isoforms of the 5HT(2C) R in ADAR2 transgenic mice. Localized serotonin levels (5-HT) were unchanged and perturbed ADAR2 equilibrium coincides with dysregulated edited amino acid isoforms of the 5HT(2C) R and reduced basal ERK signaling. These results altogether suggest that altered 5HT(2C) R function could be contributing to enhanced depression-like behavior of ADAR2 transgenic mice and further implicate ADAR2 as a contributing factor in cases of affective disorder.",2011 Aug,Genes Brain Behav. 2011 Aug;10(6):637-47. doi: 10.1111/j.1601-183X.2011.00701.x.

Furthermore, two size forms of ADAR1 are expressed by alternative promoter usage, a short (p110) nuclear form that is constitutively made and a long (p150) form that is interferon inducible and present in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. ADAR2 is also a constitutively expressed nuclear protein. Extensive A-to-G substitution has been described in mouse polyomavirus (PyV) RNA isolated late times after infection, suggesting modification by ADAR. To test the role of ADAR in PyV infection, we used genetically null mouse embryo fibroblast cells deficient in either ADAR1 or ADAR2. The single-cycle yields and growth kinetics of PyV were comparable between adar1(-/-) and adar2(-/-) genetic null fibroblast cells. While large T antigen was expressed to higher levels in adar1(-/-) cells than adar2(-/-) cells, less difference was seen in VP1 protein expression levels between the two knockout MEFs. However, virus-induced cell killing was greatly enhanced in PyV-infected adar1(-/-) cells compared to that of adar2(-/-) cells.

Although hundreds of ISGs have been identified since their discovery more than 25 years ago, only a few have been characterized with respect to antiviral activity. For most ISG products, little is known about their antiviral potential, their target specificity and their mechanisms of action. Using an overexpression screening approach, here we show that different viruses are targeted by unique sets of ISGs. We find that each viral species is susceptible to multiple antiviral genes, which together encompass a range of inhibitory activities. To conduct the screen, more than 380 human ISGs were tested for their ability to inhibit the replication of several important human and animal viruses, including hepatitis C virus, yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, chikungunya virus, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus and human immunodeficiency virus type-1. Broadly acting effectors included IRF1, C6orf150 (also known as MB21D1), HPSE, RIG-I (also known as DDX58), MDA5 (also known as IFIH1) and IFITM3, whereas more targeted antiviral specificity was observed with DDX60, IFI44L, IFI6, IFITM2, MAP3K14, MOV10, NAMPT (also known as PBEF1), OASL, RTP4, TREX1 and UNC84B (also known as SUN2). Combined expression of pairs of ISGs showed additive antiviral effects similar to those of moderate type I interferon doses. Mechanistic studies uncovered a common theme of translational inhibition for numerous effectors. Several ISGs, including ADAR, FAM46C, LY6E and MCOLN2, enhanced the replication of certain viruses, highlighting another layer of complexity in the highly pleiotropic type I interferon system.",2011 Apr 28,Nature. 2011 Apr 28;472(7344):481-5. doi: 10.1038/nature09907.

20170753,RNA surveillance-an emerging role for RNA regulatory networks in aging.,"In this review, we describe recent advances in the field of RNA regulatory biology and relate these advances to aging science. We introduce a new term, RNA surveillance, an RNA regulatory process that is conserved in metazoans, and describe how RNA surveillance represents molecular cross-talk between two emerging RNA regulatory systems-RNA interference and RNA editing. We discuss how RNA surveillance mechanisms influence mRNA and microRNA expression and activity during lifespan. Additionally, we summarize recent data from our own laboratory linking the RNA editor, ADAR, with exceptional longevity in humans and lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans. We present data showing that transcriptional knockdown of RNA interference restores lifespan losses in the context of RNA editing defects, further suggesting that interaction between these two systems influences lifespan. Finally, we discuss the implications of RNA surveillance for sarcopenia and muscle maintenance, as frailty is a universal feature of aging. We end with a discussion of RNA surveillance as a robust regulatory system that can change in response to environmental stressors and represents a novel axis in aging science.",2011 Apr,Ageing Res Rev. 2011 Apr;10(2):216-24. doi: 10.1016/j.arr.2010.02.002.

22102833,When Does ALS Start? ADAR2-GluA2 Hypothesis for the Etiology of Sporadic ALS.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common adult-onset motor neuron disease. More than 90% of ALS cases are sporadic, and the majority of sporadic ALS patients do not carry mutations in genes causative of familial ALS; therefore, investigation specifically targeting sporadic ALS is needed to discover the pathogenesis. The motor neurons of sporadic ALS patients express unedited GluA2 mRNA at the Q/R site in a disease-specific and motor neuron-selective manner. GluA2 is a subunit of the AMPA receptor, and it has a regulatory role in the Ca(2+)-permeability of the AMPA receptor after the genomic Q codon is replaced with the R codon in mRNA by adenosine-inosine conversion, which is mediated by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 2 (ADAR2). Therefore, ADAR2 activity may not be sufficient to edit all GluA2 mRNA expressed in the motor neurons of ALS patients. To investigate whether deficient ADAR2 activity plays pathogenic roles in sporadic ALS, we generated genetically modified mice (AR2) in which the ADAR2 gene was conditionally knocked out in the motor neurons. AR2 mice showed an ALS-like phenotype with the death of ADAR2-lacking motor neurons. Notably, the motor neurons deficient in ADAR2 survived when they expressed only edited GluA2 in AR2/GluR-B(R/R) (AR2res) mice, in which the endogenous GluA2 alleles were replaced by the GluR-B(R) allele that encoded edited GluA2. In heterozygous AR2 mice with only one ADAR2 allele, approximately 20% of the spinal motor neurons expressed unedited GluA2 and underwent degeneration, indicating that half-normal ADAR2 activity is not sufficient to edit all GluA2 expressed in motor neurons. It is likely therefore that the expression of unedited GluA2 causes the death of motor neurons in sporadic ALS. We hypothesize that a progressive downregulation of ADAR2 activity plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of sporadic ALS and that the pathological process commences when motor neurons express unedited GluA2.",2011,Front Mol Neurosci. 2011 Nov 2;4:33. doi: 10.3389/fnmol.2011.00033. eCollection 2011.,"['Hideyama T', 'Kwak S']",True

Sepsis is the usual cause of mortality but much of the pathophysiologic process results from an outpouring of cytokines and matrixmetalloproteinases (MMPs) which have a destructive effect on the extracellular matrix and may play a part in the epidermal/dermal cleavage seen with this disease. Recent attention has been focused on the modulation of proteases in an attempt to decrease the MMP-mediated destruction. Nanocrystalline silver (NCS) is one such agent that has good anti-microbial efficacy, but is also effective in modulating MMP levels. Twelve cases of confirmed TEN that were treated with NCS were analyzed with a view to assessing efficacy and setting logical guidelines for managing this condition, particularly in relation to immunosupressed patients.

21218337,Possible editing of Alu transcripts in blood cells of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD).,"Editing of RNA molecules gained major interest when coding mRNA was analyzed. A small, noncoding, Alu DNA element transcript that may act as regulatory RNA in cells was examined in this study. Alu DNA element transcription was determined in buffy coat from healthy humans and human sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) cases. In addition, non-sCJD controls, mostly dementia cases and Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases, were included. The Alu cDNA sequences were aligned to genomic Alu DNA elements by database search. A comparison of best aligned Alu DNA sequences with our RNA/cDNA clones revealed editing by deamination by ADAR (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA) and APOBEC (apolipoprotein B editing complex). Nucleotide exchanges like a G instead of an A or a T instead of a C in our cDNA sequences versus genomic Alu DNA pointed to recent mutations. To confirm this, our Alu cDNA sequences were aligned not only to genomic human Alu DNA but also to the respective genomic DNA of the chimpanzee and rhesus. Enhanced ADAR correlated with A-G exchanges in dementia, AD, and sCJD was noted when compared to healthy controls as well as APOBEC-related C-T exchanges. The APOBEC-related mutations were higher in healthy controls than in cases suffering from neurodegeneration, with the exception of the dementia group with the prion protein gene (PRNP) MV genotype. Hence, this study may be considered the first real-time analysis of Alu DNA element transcripts with regard to editing of the respective Alu transcripts in human blood cells.",2011,J Toxicol Environ Health A. 2011;74(2-4):88-95. doi: 10.1080/15287394.2011.529057.,"['Kiesel P', 'Gibson TJ', 'Ciesielczyk B', 'Bodemer M', 'Kaup FJ', 'Bodemer W', 'Zischler H', 'Zerr I']",False
21310295,RNA editing by mammalian ADARs.,"The main type of RNA editing in mammals is the conversion of adenosine to inosine which is translated as if it were guanosine. The enzymes that catalyze this reaction are ADARs (adenosine deaminases that act on RNA), of which there are four in mammals, two of which are catalytically inactive. ADARs edit transcripts that encode proteins expressed mainly in the CNS and editing is crucial to maintain a correctly functioning nervous system. However, the majority of editing has been found in transcripts encoding Alu repeat elements and the biological role of this editing remains a mystery. This chapter describes in detail the different ADAR enzymes and the phenotype of animals that are deficient in their activity. Besides being enzymes, ADARs are also double-stranded RNA-binding proteins, so by binding alone they can interfere with other processes such as RNA interference. Lack of editing by ADARs has been implicated in disorders such as forebrain ischemia and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and this will also be discussed.",2011,Adv Genet. 2011;73:87-120. doi: 10.1016/B978-0-12-380860-8.00003-3.,"['Hogg M', 'Paro S', 'Keegan LP', ""O'Connell MA""]",True
21370041,Perturbing A-to-I RNA editing using genetics and homologous recombination.,"Evidence for the chemical conversion of adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) in messenger RNA (mRNA) has been detected in numerous metazoans, especially those ""most successful"" phyla: Arthropoda, Mollusca, and Chordata. The requisite enzymes for A-to-I editing, ADARs (adenosine deaminases acting on RNA) are highly conserved and are present in every higher metazoan genome sequenced to date. The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, represents an ideal model organism for studying A-to-I editing, both in terms of fundamental biochemistry and in relation to determining adaptive downstream effects on physiology and behavior. The Drosophila genome contains a single structural gene for ADAR (dAdar), yet the fruit fly transcriptome has the widest range of conserved and validated ADAR targets in coding mRNAs of any known organism. In addition, many of the genes targeted by dADAR have been genetically identified as playing a role in nervous system function, providing a rich source of material to investigate the biological relevance of this intriguing process. Here, we discuss how recent advances in the use of ends-out homologous recombination (HR) in Drosophila make possible both the precise control of the editing status for defined adenosine residues and the engineering of flies with globally altered RNA editing of the fly transcriptome. These new approaches promise to significantly improve our understanding of how mRNA modification contributes to insect physiology and ethology.",2011,Methods Mol Biol. 2011;718:41-73. doi: 10.1007/978-1-61779-018-8_3.,"['Staber CJ', 'Gell S', 'Jepson JE', 'Reenan RA']",True

21587236,Predicting sites of ADAR editing in double-stranded RNA.,"ADAR (adenosine deaminase that acts on RNA) editing enzymes target coding and noncoding double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and are essential for neuronal function. Early studies showed that ADARs preferentially target adenosines with certain 5' and 3' neighbours. Here we use current Sanger sequencing protocols to perform a more accurate and quantitative analysis. We quantified editing sites in an ∼800-bp dsRNA after reaction with human ADAR1 or ADAR2, or their catalytic domains alone. These large data sets revealed that neighbour preferences are mostly dictated by the catalytic domain, but ADAR2's dsRNA-binding motifs contribute to 3' neighbour preferences. For all proteins, the 5' nearest neighbour was most influential, but adjacent bases also affected editing site choice. We developed algorithms to predict editing sites in dsRNA of any sequence, and provide a web-based application. The predictive power of the algorithm on fully base-paired dsRNA, compared with biological substrates containing mismatches, bulges and loops, elucidates structural contributions to editing specificity.",2011,Nat Commun. 2011;2:319. doi: 10.1038/ncomms1324.,"['Eggington JM', 'Greene T', 'Bass BL']",True
22022455,Very few RNA and DNA sequence differences in the human transcriptome.,"RNA editing is an important cellular process by which the nucleotides in a mature RNA transcript are altered to cause them to differ from the corresponding DNA sequence. While this process yields essential transcripts in humans and other organisms, it is believed to occur at a relatively small number of loci. The rarity of RNA editing has been challenged by a recent comparison of human RNA and DNA sequence data from 27 individuals, which revealed that over 10,000 human exonic sites appear to exhibit RNA-DNA differences (RDDs). Many of these differences could not have been caused by either of the two previously known human RNA editing mechanisms--ADAR-mediated A→G substitutions or APOBEC1-mediated C→U switches--suggesting that a previously unknown mechanism of RNA editing may be active in humans. Here, we reanalyze these data and demonstrate that genomic sequences exist in these same individuals or in the human genome that match the majority of RDDs. Our results suggest that the majority of these RDD events were observed due to accurate transcription of sequences paralogous to the apparently edited gene but differing at the edited site. In light of our results it seems prudent to conclude that if indeed an unknown mechanism is causing RDD events in humans, such events occur at a much lower frequency than originally proposed.",2011,PLoS One. 2011;6(10):e25842. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0025842.

22028885,Inosine-containing RNA is a novel innate immune recognition element and reduces RSV infection.,"During viral infections, single- and double-stranded RNA (ssRNA and dsRNA) are recognized by the host and induce innate immune responses. The cellular enzyme ADAR-1 (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA-1) activation in virally infected cells leads to presence of inosine-containing RNA (Ino-RNA). Here we report that ss-Ino-RNA is a novel viral recognition element. We synthesized unmodified ssRNA and ssRNA that had 6% to16% inosine residues. The results showed that in primary human cells, or in mice, 10% ss-Ino-RNA rapidly and potently induced a significant increase in inflammatory cytokines, such as interferon (IFN)-β (35 fold), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α (9.7 fold), and interleukin (IL)-6 (11.3 fold) (p<0.01). Flow cytometry data revealed a corresponding 4-fold increase in influx of neutrophils into the lungs by ss-Ino-RNA treatment. In our in vitro experiments, treatment of epithelial cells with ss-Ino-RNA reduced replication of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Interestingly, RNA structural analysis showed that ss-Ino-RNA had increased formation of secondary structures. Our data further revealed that extracellular ss-Ino-RNA was taken up by scavenger receptor class-A (SR-A) which activated downstream MAP Kinase pathways through Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) and dsRNA-activated protein kinase (PKR). Our data suggests that ss-Ino-RNA is an as yet undescribed virus-associated innate immune stimulus.",2011,PLoS One. 2011;6(10):e26463. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0026463.

21037424,Analysis of A to I editing of miRNA in macrophages exposed to Salmonella.,"The main mediator of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) response in macrophages is activation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). This generates interferon-beta (INF-beta) production that stimulates increased expression of the RNA editing enzyme ADAR1. To determine if there is an increase in RNA editing in mature miRNA in response to TLR4 activation upon Salmonella infection of macrophages we analyzed small RNA deep sequencing data. Interestingly, we found that direct infection of macrophage cell lines with Salmonella does not result in an increase of edited mature miRNA. Thus, despite elevated levels of ADAR1 during TLR4 activation of macrophages mediated by Salmonella infection, ADAR1 does not result in redirection of miRNA. The most common consequence of ADAR activity on miRNA is a reduction in the mature miRNA level due to interference with miRNA processing of pri-miRNA. However, we found very few miRNAs with reductions in level, and no significant difference between miRNAs previously reported to be edited and those reported to be not edited. In particular, we did not see significant decrease in mir-22 and mir-142, nor editing of pri-mir-22 or pri-mir-142 in infected RAW macrophages. Thus, ADAR1 has very little, if any, effect on the miRNA machinery following TL4 activation by Salmonella infection.",2010 Sep-Oct,RNA Biol. 2010 Sep-Oct;7(5):621-7. doi: 10.4161/rna.7.5.13269.

20826656,Induced loss of ADAR2 engenders slow death of motor neurons from Q/R site-unedited GluR2.,"GluR2 is a subunit of the AMPA receptor, and the adenosine for the Q/R site of its pre-mRNA is converted to inosine (A-to-I conversion) by the enzyme called adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 2 (ADAR2). Failure of A-to-I conversion at this site affects multiple AMPA receptor properties, including the Ca(2+) permeability of the receptor-coupled ion channel, thereby inducing fatal epilepsy in mice (Brusa et al., 1995; Feldmeyer et al., 1999). In addition, inefficient GluR2 Q/R site editing is a disease-specific molecular dysfunction found in the motor neurons of sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients (Kawahara et al., 2004). Here, we generated genetically modified mice (designated as AR2) in which the ADAR2 gene was conditionally targeted in motor neurons using the Cre/loxP system. These AR2 mice showed a decline in motor function commensurate with the slow death of ADAR2-deficient motor neurons in the spinal cord and cranial motor nerve nuclei. Notably, neurons in nuclei of oculomotor nerves, which often escape degeneration in ALS, were not decreased in number despite a significant decrease in GluR2 Q/R site editing. All cellular and phenotypic changes in AR2 mice were prevented when the mice carried endogenous GluR2 alleles engineered to express edited GluR2 without ADAR2 activity (Higuchi et al., 2000). Thus, loss of ADAR2 activity causes AMPA receptor-mediated death of motor neurons.",2010 Sep 8,J Neurosci. 2010 Sep 8;30(36):11917-25. doi: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2021-10.2010.,"['Hideyama T', 'Yamashita T', 'Suzuki T', 'Tsuji S', 'Higuchi M', 'Seeburg PH', 'Takahashi R', 'Misawa H', 'Kwak S']",True

Although hyperedited dsRNAs (IU-dsRNAs) have been implicated in various cellular functions, we now provide evidence for another role. We show that IU-dsRNA suppresses the induction of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and apoptosis by poly(IC). Moreover, we show that IU-dsRNA inhibits the activation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), which is essential for the induction of ISGs and apoptosis. Finally, we speculate that the inhibition of IRF3 results from specific binding of IU-dsRNA to MDA-5 or RIG-I, both of which are cytosolic sensors for poly(IC). Although our data are consistent with a previous study in which ADAR1 deletion resulted in increased expression of ISGs and apoptosis, we show that IU-dsRNA per se suppresses ISGs and apoptosis. We therefore propose that any IU-dsRNA generated by ADAR1 can inhibit both pathways.",2010 Sep,Nat Struct Mol Biol. 2010 Sep;17(9):1043-50. doi: 10.1038/nsmb.1864.

20651031,The roles of phospholipase C activation and alternative ADAR1 and ADAR2 pre-mRNA splicing in modulating serotonin 2C-receptor editing in vivo.,"The serotonin 2C receptor (5-HT2CR), a Gq-protein-coupled neurotransmitter receptor, exists in multiple isoforms that result from RNA editing of five exonic adenosines that are converted to inosines. In the adult brain, editing of 5-HT2C pre-mRNA exhibits remarkable plasticity in response to environmental and neurochemical stimuli. Here, we investigated two potential mechanisms underlying these plastic changes in adult 5-HT2CR editing phenotypes in vivo: activation of phospholipase C (PLC) and alternative splicing of pre-mRNA encoding the editing enzymes ADAR1 and ADAR2. Studies on two inbred strains of mice (C57Bl/6 and Balb/c) revealed that sustained stimulation of PLC--a downstream effector of activated G alpha q protein--increased editing of forebrain neocortical 5-HT2C pre-mRNA at two sites known to be targeted by ADAR2. Moreover, changes in relative expression of the alternatively spliced ""a"" and ""b"" mRNA isoforms of ADAR1 and ADAR2 also correlate with changes in 5-HT2CR editing. The site-specific changes in 5-HT2CR editing detected in mice with different ""a"" over ""b"" ADAR mRNA isoform ratios only partially overlap with those evoked by sustained PLC activation and are best explained by the increased editing efficiency of ADAR1. Thus, activation of PLC and alternative splicing of ADAR pre-mRNA have both overlapping and specific roles in modulating 5-HT2CR editing phenotypes.",2010 Sep,RNA. 2010 Sep;16(9):1779-85. doi: 10.1261/rna.2188110.

Data from several postmortem studies have shown increased 5-hydroxytryptamine-2C receptor RNA editing in mood disorders and suicide, and therefore the 5-hydroxytryptamine-2C receptor might be expected to have reduced signal transduction in these patients. In this study, we have tested the hypothesis that the expression levels of the enzymes which catalyze RNA editing, adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) and ADAR2, are also abnormal in suicide.

20501795,Deficiency in RNA editing enzyme ADAR2 impairs regulated exocytosis.,"Mammalian RNA editing catalyzed by adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) ADAR1 and ADAR2 plays pivotal roles in the brain through functional modifications of neurotransmitter receptors and ion channels. We have demonstrated previously that RNA editing by ADAR2 is regulated metabolically in pancreatic β cells. To investigate the cellular functions of ADAR2 in professional secretory cells, we studied the effects of ADAR2 knockdown on regulated exocytosis. Selective knockdown of ADAR2 expression markedly impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in the rat insulinoma INS-1 cells and primary pancreatic islets and significantly diminished KCl-stimulated secretion of exogenous human growth hormone or endogenous chromogranin B protein in the rat adrenal pheochromocytoma PC12 cells. Notably, restored overexpression of catalytically active but not editing-deficient mutant ADAR2 could rescue the impairment in stimulated secretion from ADAR2 knockdown cells. Moreover, ADAR2 suppression significantly attenuated Ca(2+)-evoked membrane capacitance increases and appreciably reduced the number of membrane-docked insulin granules in INS-1 cells. Interestingly, the secretory defects resulting from ADAR2 deficiency were coupled to decreased expression of Munc18-1 and synaptotagmin-7, two key molecules in the regulation of vesicle exocytosis.

Although bioinformatic approaches have predicted a number of A-to-I editing sites in cDNAs, the human transcriptome is thought to still harbor large numbers of as-yet-unknown editing sites. Exploring new editing sites requires a biochemical method to accurately identify inosines on RNA strands. We here describe a chemical method to identify inosines, called inosine chemical erasing (ICE), that is based on cyanoethylation combined with reverse transcription. We carried out a large-scale verification of the ICE method focusing on 642 regions in human cDNA and identified 5,072 editing sites, including 4,395 new sites. Functional study revealed that A-to-I intronic editing in the SARS gene mediated by ADAR1 is involved in preventing aberrant exonization of Alu sequence into mature mRNA.",2010 Oct,Nat Chem Biol. 2010 Oct;6(10):733-40. doi: 10.1038/nchembio.434.

The pre-mRNA for the 2c subtype of serotonin receptor (5-HT2cR) is shown here to support small molecule binding near known editing sites. Furthermore, a helix-threading peptide binds this site and inhibits the in vitro reaction of ADAR2 in an RNA-substrate selective manner.

The crystal structure of the E3L orthologue of YLDV (yabZα(E3L)) bound to Z-DNA revealed that the overall structure of yabZα(E3L) and its interaction with Z-DNA are very similar to those of hZα(ADAR1).

The two forms of NEIL1 are shown here to have distinct enzymatic properties. The edited form removes thymine glycol from duplex DNA 30 times more slowly than the form encoded in the genome, whereas editing enhances repair of the guanidinohydantoin lesion by NEIL1. In addition, we show that the NEIL1 recoding site is a preferred editing site for the RNA editing adenosine deaminase ADAR1. The edited adenosine resides in an A-C mismatch in a hairpin stem formed by pairing of exon 6 to the immediate upstream intron 5 sequence.

21110885,ADAR2-dependent RNA editing of GluR2 is involved in thiamine deficiency-induced alteration of calcium dynamics.,"BACKGROUND: Thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency (TD) causes mild impairment of oxidative metabolism and region-selective neuronal loss in the central nervous system (CNS). TD in animals has been used to model aging-associated neurodegeneration in the brain. The mechanisms of TD-induced neuron death are complex, and it is likely multiple mechanisms interplay and contribute to the action of TD. In this study, we demonstrated that TD significantly increased intracellular calcium concentrations [Ca2+]i in cultured cortical neurons. RESULTS: TD drastically potentiated AMPA-triggered calcium influx and inhibited pre-mRNA editing of GluR2, a Ca2+-permeable subtype of AMPA receptors. The Ca2+ permeability of GluR2 is regulated by RNA editing at the Q/R site. Edited GluR2 (R) subunits form Ca2+-impermeable channels, whereas unedited GluR2 (Q) channels are permeable to Ca2+ flow. TD inhibited Q/R editing of GluR2 and increased the ratio of unedited GluR2. The Q/R editing of GluR2 is mediated by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 2 (ADAR2). TD selectively decreased ADAR2 expression and its self-editing ability without affecting ADAR1 in cultured neurons and in the brain tissue. Over-expression of ADAR2 reduced AMPA-mediated rise of [Ca2+]i and protected cortical neurons against TD-induced cytotoxicity, whereas down-regulation of ADAR2 increased AMPA-elicited Ca2+ influx and exacerbated TD-induced death of cortical neurons.

20656402,The demarcation of arbitrary boundaries for coastal zone management: the Israeli case.,"Integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) addresses the interconnections, complexities, and conflicts between many users of the coastal area with different goals. It requires setting managerial boundaries that capture many elements of human and natural systems. Experience teaches us that without a directed effort managerial rules and laws are not likely to coincide with the physical sensitivity of units that reflect different environmental characteristics of the coastal zone. Hence the aim of this study is to explore why coastal managerial boundaries are set arbitrarily and whether and how it is possible to address the problems this poses. We examine what influences the decisions of a new coastal management authority in Israel to determine how this body overcomes the limits of arbitrary boundary demarcation. The study found that real life management succeeded to both address areas outside the arbitrary boundaries and also to respect some of the different socio-economic needs and physical constraints of the coastal sub-units. Israel's Coastal Environment Protection Law allows and, in fact, encourages the regulator to use discretion and to employ various criteria to balance development and conservation. This implies that policy makers are cognizant of a need to balance ecologically-sensitive boundaries that consider the homogeneity of the coast with politically feasible boundaries that are set arbitrarily.",2010 Nov,J Environ Manage. 2010 Nov;91(11):2358-69. doi: 10.1016/j.jenvman.2010.06.027.

CaPKZ, the first identified fish PKZ, possessed a conserved eIF2alpha kinase catalytic domain in C-terminal and two Z-DNA binding domains (Zalpha) in N-terminal. The Zalpha of CaPKZ closely resembled that of other Z-DNA binding proteins: ADAR1, DLM-1, and E3L. In order to understand more about the function of CaPKZ, we expressed and purified three constructed peptides of CaPKZ (P(Zalpha)): P(Zalpha1Zalpha2), P(Zalpha1Zalpha1) and P(Zalpha2)(Zalpha2). Moreover, most of the plasmids containing d(GC)(n) inserts were maintained in the Z-conformation, as confirmed by using inhibition of methylation experiments and anti-Z-DNA antibody. Gel mobility shift assays were then used to examine the affinity of these P(Zalpha) to the recombinant plasmids. Meanwhile, a competition experiment using P(Zalpha1Zalpha2) and anti-Z-DNA antibody was performed. The results revealed that P(Zalpha1Zalpha2) and P(Zalpha1Zalpha1) were able to bind to the recombinant plasmids with high affinity, whereas P(Zalpha2)(Zalpha2) could not bind to it. In addition, dimerization of P(Zalpha1Zalpha2) indicated the function unit of Zalpha of CaPKZ would be a dimer.",2010 May-Jun,Fish Shellfish Immunol. 2010 May-Jun;28(5-6):783-8. doi: 10.1016/j.fsi.2010.01.021.

20531933,"A survey of genomic traces reveals a common sequencing error, RNA editing, and DNA editing.","While it is widely held that an organism's genomic information should remain constant, several protein families are known to modify it. Members of the AID/APOBEC protein family can deaminate DNA. Similarly, members of the ADAR family can deaminate RNA. Characterizing the scope of these events is challenging. Here we use large genomic data sets, such as the two billion sequences in the NCBI Trace Archive, to look for clusters of mismatches of the same type, which are a hallmark of editing events caused by APOBEC3 and ADAR. We align 603,249,815 traces from the NCBI trace archive to their reference genomes. In clusters of mismatches of increasing size, at least one systematic sequencing error dominates the results (G-to-A). It is still present in mismatches with 99% accuracy and only vanishes in mismatches at 99.99% accuracy or higher. The error appears to have entered into about 1% of the HapMap, possibly affecting other users that rely on this resource. Further investigation, using stringent quality thresholds, uncovers thousands of mismatch clusters with no apparent defects in their chromatograms. These traces provide the first reported candidates of endogenous DNA editing in human, further elucidating RNA editing in human and mouse and also revealing, for the first time, extensive RNA editing in Xenopus tropicalis.

20439751,Crystal structure of a junction between two Z-DNA helices.,"The double helix of DNA, when composed of dinucleotide purine-pyrimidine repeats, can adopt a left-handed helical structure called Z-DNA. For reasons not entirely understood, such dinucleotide repeats in genomic sequences have been associated with genomic instability leading to cancer. Adoption of the left-handed conformation results in the formation of conformational junctions: A B-to-Z junction is formed at the boundaries of the helix, whereas a Z-to-Z junction is commonly formed in sequences where the dinucleotide repeat is interrupted by single base insertions or deletions that bring neighboring helices out of phase. B-Z junctions are shown to result in exposed nucleotides vulnerable to chemical or enzymatic modification. Here we describe the three-dimensional structure of a Z-Z junction stabilized by Zalpha, the Z-DNA binding domain of the RNA editing enzyme ADAR1. We show that the junction structure consists of a single base pair and leads to partial or full disruption of the helical stacking. The junction region allows intercalating agents to insert themselves into the left-handed helix, which is otherwise resistant to intercalation. However, unlike a B-Z junction, in this structure the bases are not fully extruded, and the stacking between the two left-handed helices is not continuous.",2010 May 18,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2010 May 18;107(20):9088-92. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1003182107.

ADAR2 pre-mRNA undergoes a number of known alternative splicing events, affecting its function. Here we describe a novel alternatively spliced exon, located within intron 7 of the human gene, which we term ""exon 7a"". This alternatively spliced exon is highly conserved in the mammalian ADAR2 gene. It has stop codons in all three frames and is down regulated by NMD. We show that the level of exon 7a inclusion differs between different human tissues, with the highest levels of inclusion in skeletal muscle, heart and testis. In the brain, where the level of editing is known to be high, the level of exon 7a inclusion is low. The new alternative form was also found in supraspliceosomes, which constitute the nuclear pre-mRNA processing machine.

20574523,Alu sequences in undifferentiated human embryonic stem cells display high levels of A-to-I RNA editing.,"Adenosine to Inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing is a site-specific modification of RNA transcripts, catalyzed by members of the ADAR (Adenosine Deaminase Acting on RNA) protein family. RNA editing occurs in human RNA in thousands of different sites. Some of the sites are located in protein-coding regions but the majority is found in non-coding regions, such as 3'UTRs, 5'UTRs and introns - mainly in Alu elements. While editing is found in all tissues, the highest levels of editing are found in the brain. It was shown that editing levels within protein-coding regions are increased during embryogenesis and after birth and that RNA editing is crucial for organism viability as well as for normal development. In this study we characterized the A-to-I RNA editing phenomenon during neuronal and spontaneous differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). We identified high editing levels of Alu repetitive elements in hESCs and demonstrated a global decrease in editing levels of non-coding Alu sites when hESCs are differentiating, particularly into the neural lineage. Using RNA interference, we showed that the elevated editing levels of Alu elements in undifferentiated hESCs are highly dependent on ADAR1. DNA microarray analysis showed that ADAR1 knockdown has a global effect on gene expression in hESCs and leads to a significant increase in RNA expression levels of genes involved in differentiation and development processes, including neurogenesis. Taken together, we speculate that A-to-I editing of Alu sequences plays a role in the regulation of hESC early differentiation decisions.",2010 Jun 21,PLoS One. 2010 Jun 21;5(6):e11173. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0011173.,"['Osenberg S', 'Paz Yaacov N', 'Safran M', 'Moshkovitz S', 'Shtrichman R', 'Sherf O', 'Jacob-Hirsch J', 'Keshet G', 'Amariglio N', 'Itskovitz-Eldor J', 'Rechavi G']",True

We also observed that cytokine stimulation suppressed muscle-associated microRNAs, an observation also not previously demonstrated. To map potential effects of ADAR1 induction in the muscle program, we conducted knockdown and overexpression studies in the mouse C2C12 muscle precursor cell (MPC) line and in primary human MPCs. We show that knockdown of stress-induced ADAR1 increased inflammation-mediated declines in the muscle differentiation markers Myogenin and myosin heavy chain, and knockdown reduced levels of active phosphorylated Akt (phospho-Akt), but had no effect on microRNA transcript levels, suggesting a role for ADAR1 in buffering inflammatory stress effects on myogenic transcription and protein synthesis pathways. In addition, overexpression of recombinant ADAR1 suppressed active phosphorylated double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-dependent protein kinase (phospho-PKR), consistent with a role for ADAR1 in limiting inflammation-driven catabolic atrophy pathways.

20456005,Acute spinal cord injury persistently reduces R/G RNA editing of AMPA receptors.,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) triggers a complex ischemic and inflammatory reaction, involving activation of neurotransmitter systems, in particular glutamate, culminating in cell death. We hypothesized that SCI might lead to alteration in the RNA editing of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) receptors that govern critical determinants of neuronal survival. To this end, we examined the molecular changes set in motion by SCI that affect the channel properties of AMPA receptors. SCI strongly reduced the level of AMPA receptor R/G editing, involving not only the site of the lesion but also adjacent areas of the cord spared by the lesion. The effects, with changes for some subunits and loci, were observed as long as 30 days after lesioning and may correlate with a partial decrease in enzymatic activity of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 2 (ADAR2), as deduced from the analysis of ADAR2 self-editing. The reduced editing at the R/G site of glutamate receptor subunits (GluRs) is likely to reduce post-synaptic excitatory responses to glutamate, thus limiting the progression of cell death; however, prolonged suppression of GluR function in later stages may hinder synaptic plasticity.

These studies have discovered thousands of genes that are hyper-edited in their non-coding intronic regions, especially in alu retrotransposable elements, but very few substrates that are site-selectively edited in coding regions. Known RNA edited substrates suggest, however, that site selective A-to-I editing is particularly important for normal brain development in mammals. RESULTS: We have compiled a screen that enables the identification of new sites of site-selective editing, primarily in coding sequences. To avoid hyper-edited repeat regions, we applied our screen to the alu-free mouse genome. Focusing on the mouse also facilitated better experimental verification. To identify candidate sites of RNA editing, we first performed an explorative screen based on RNA structure and genomic sequence conservation. We further evaluated the results of the explorative screen by determining which transcripts were enriched for A-G mismatches between the genomic template and the expressed sequence since the editing product, inosine (I), is read as guanosine (G) by the translational machinery. For expressed sequences, we only considered coding regions to focus entirely on re-coding events. Lastly, we refined the results from the explorative screen using a novel scoring scheme based on characteristics for known A-to-I edited sites. The extent of editing in the final candidate genes was verified using total RNA from mouse brain and 454 sequencing. CONCLUSIONS: Using this method, we identified and confirmed efficient editing at one site in the Gabra3 gene. Editing was also verified at several other novel sites within candidates predicted to be edited. Five of these sites are situated in genes coding for the neuron-specific RNA binding proteins HuB and HuD.",2010 Jan 4,BMC Bioinformatics. 2010 Jan 4;11:6. doi: 10.1186/1471-2105-11-6.,"['Ensterö M', 'Akerborg O', 'Lundin D', 'Wang B', 'Furey TS', 'Ohman M', 'Lagergren J']",True
19913273,RNA adenosine deaminase ADAR1 deficiency leads to increased activation of protein kinase PKR and reduced vesicular stomatitis virus growth following interferon treatment.,"Two size forms of ADAR1 adenosine deaminase are known, one constitutively expressed (p110) and the other interferon (IFN)-induced (p150). To test the role of ADAR1 in viral infection, HeLa cells with ADAR1 stably knocked down and 293 cells overexpressing ADAR1 were utilized. Overexpression of p150 ADAR1 had no significant effect on the yield of vesicular stomatitis virus. Likewise, reduction of p110 and p150 ADAR1 proteins to less than approximately 10 to 15% of parental levels (ADAR1-deficient) had no significant effect on VSV growth in the absence of IFN treatment. However, inhibition of virus growth following IFN treatment was approximately 1 log(10) further reduced compared to ADAR1-sufficient cells. The level of phosphorylated protein kinase PKR was increased in ADAR1-deficient cells compared to ADAR1-sufficient cells following IFN treatment, regardless of viral infection. These results suggest that ADAR1 suppresses activation of PKR and inhibition of VSV growth in response to IFN treatment.",2010 Jan 20,Virology. 2010 Jan 20;396(2):316-22. doi: 10.1016/j.virol.2009.10.026.

Although HDV contains a gene, the protein produced (HDAg) is encoded by less than half the genome and possesses no RNA polymerase activity. Because of this limited coding capacity, HDV relies heavily on host functions and on structural features of the viral RNA-very much like viroids. The virus' use of host RNA editing activity to produce two functionally distinct forms of HDAg is a particularly good example of this reliance.

20863128,Minor-groove-modulating adenosine replacements control protein binding and RNAi activity in siRNAs.,"Short-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are common tools in molecular biology; however, the development of RNAi-based therapeutics is limited by immunostimulatory and nonspecific effects mediated by off-target RNA-binding proteins. The RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) and adenosine deaminase that acts on RNA 1 (ADAR1) are two proteins implicated in RNAi off-target effects and share a common means of interaction with siRNAs through double-stranded RNA binding motifs (dsRBMs). Here we report the site-specific introduction of N²-propargyl 2-aminopurine into siRNAs and subsequent conversion to two bulky products via copper-catalyzed azide alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) with either N-azidoacetyl-mannosamine azide or N-ethylpiperidine azide. We observed position-specific effects on RNAi activity for modifications made to both the passenger and guide strands. These findings are rationalized in light of recent structural studies of components of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and RISC-loading complex (RLC). The most active siRNAs were assayed for binding affinity to PKR and ADAR1. PKR binding was significantly reduced by multiple modifications, regardless of size, and ADAR1 binding was reduced in a position- and size-sensitive manner. Our findings present a strategy for designing siRNAs that reduce off-target dsRBM-protein binding while retaining native RNAi activity.",2010 Dec 17,ACS Chem Biol. 2010 Dec 17;5(12):1115-24. doi: 10.1021/cb100245u.

20886259,RNA editing in P transposable element read-through transcripts in Drosophila melanogaster.,"RNA editing is proposed as a modulator of transcriptomes, but its biological impact has not been fully elucidated. In particular, its importance for transposable elements is controversial. We found RNA editing on antisense read-through transcripts of KP elements, one of the deletion derivatives of P transposable elements in Drosophila melanogaster. Three kinds of RNA editing were detected at 20 sites around the terminal inverted repeats (TIR); 15 A-to-G, four U-to-C, and one C-to-U conversions. A-to-G conversions are suggested to be attributed to A-to-I RNA editing on KP element RNAs, because inosine (I) in RNA is recognized as G by reverse transcriptase.

20408958,AMPA receptor downregulation induced by ischaemia/reperfusion is attenuated by age and blocked by meloxicam.,"AIM: Stroke prevalence increases with age, while alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid receptor (AMPAR) and inflammation have been related to ischaemia-induced damage. This study shows how age and treatment with an anti-inflammatory agent (meloxicam) modify the levels of AMPAR subunits GluR1 and GluR2, as well as the mRNA levels of the GluR2-editing enzyme, ADAR2, in a global brain ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) model. METHODS: Two days after global ischaemia CA1, CA3, dentate gyrus and cerebral cortex were obtained from sham-operated and I/R-injured 3- and 18-month-old Sprague-Dawley rats. Real time polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting and immunohistochemical assays were performed. Meloxicam treatment was assayed on young animals. RESULTS: Data showed that age attenuates the downregulation induced by I/R in the AMPAR subunits GluR1 and GluR2 and modifies the GluR1/GluR2 mRNA level ratio in a structure-dependent way. The study of the ADAR2 mRNA levels showed more downregulation in older animals than young ones. Meloxicam treatment prevented the transcriptional arrest induced by I/R. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that changes in the AMPAR isoforms could be associated with ageing in the different structures studied. Although GluR2 editing seems to be involved in age-dependent vulnerability to ischaemia supporting the 'GluR2 hypothesis', this alone does not explain the differential vulnerability in the different brain regions.

20215872,Unraveling pleiotropic functions of A-to-I RNA editing in Drosophila.,"In metazoan cells, transcripts that fold into double-strand RNA structures are endowed with the capacity to undergo A-to-I RNA editing, during which adenosines are catalytically deaminated to inosines by a class of enzymes known as ADARs (adenosine deaminases acting on RNA). In Drosophila, a wide range of coding mRNAs associated with signaling in the nervous system undergo A-to-I editing, and loss of editing results in extreme behavioral defects. Furthermore, there are indications that the precursors of endogenous small interfering RNAs also undergo editing. However, the mechanism by which A-to-I editing is related to ethology in Drosophila is unclear, as are the precise cell-types and developmental stages in which editing is most crucial. We have investigated these issues by altering small RNA production in flies lacking ADAR, and modulating editing levels in both time and space through a variety of transgenic techniques. Our results indicate that genetic re-coding in the nervous system is likely to be the primary pathway through which editing affects behavioral outputs, and further suggest that editing is required to 'fine-tune' neuro-transmission in the adult brain.",2010 Apr-Jun,Fly (Austin). 2010 Apr-Jun;4(2):154-8. doi: 10.4161/fly.4.2.11232.

20051222,A mammalian reporter system for fast and quantitative detection of intracellular A-to-I RNA editing levels.,"An important molecular mechanism to create protein diversity from a limited set of genes is A-to-I RNA editing. RNA editing converts single adenosines into inosines in pre-mRNA. These single base conversions can have a wide variety of consequences. Editing can lead to codon changes and, consequently, altered protein function. Moreover, editing can alter splice sites and influences miRNA biogenesis and target recognition. The two enzymes responsible for editing in mammals are adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) 1 and 2. However, it is currently largely unknown how the activity of these enzymes is regulated in vivo. Editing activity does not always correlate with ADAR expression levels, suggesting posttranscriptional or posttranslational mechanisms for controlling activity. To investigate how editing is regulated in mammalian cells, we have developed a straightforward quantitative reporter system to detect editing levels. By employing luciferase activity as a readout, we could easily detect different levels of editing in a cellular context. In addition, increased levels of ADAR2 correlated with increased levels of luciferase activity. This reporter system therefore sets the stage for the effective screening of cDNA libraries or small molecules for strong modulators of intracellular editing to ultimately elucidate how A-to-I editing is regulated in vivo.",2010 Apr 15,Anal Biochem. 2010 Apr 15;399(2):230-6. doi: 10.1016/j.ab.2009.12.037.

We demonstrated that RNA editing of GluR2 mRNA at the glutamine/arginine (Q/R) site was decreased in autopsy-obtained spinal motor neurons, but not in cerebellar Purkinje cells, of patients with sporadic ALS. This molecular change occurs in motor neurons of sporadic ALS cases with various phenotypes, but not in degenerating neurons of patients with other neurodegenerative diseases, including SOD1-associated familial ALS. Because GluR2 Q/R site-editing is specifically catalyzed by adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 2 (ADAR2), it is likely that regulatory mechanism of ADAR2 activity does not work well in the motor neurons of sporadic ALS. Indeed, ADAR2 expression level was significantly decreased in the spinal ventral gray matter of sporadic ALS as compared to normal control subjects. It is likely that ADAR2 underactivity selective in motor neurons induced deficient GluR2 Q/R site-editing, which results in the neuronal death of sporadic ALS. Thus, among multiple different molecular mechanisms underlying death of motor neurons, it is likely that an increase of the proportion of Q/R site-unedited GluR2-containing Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptors initiates the death of motor neurons in sporadic ALS. To this end, normalization of ADAR2 activity in motor neurons may become a therapeutic strategy for sporadic ALS.",2010 Apr,Neuropathology. 2010 Apr;30(2):182-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1440-1789.2009.01090.x.

Because adenosine deaminase acting on RNA type 2 (ADAR2) specifically catalyzes GluR2 Q/R site-editing, it is likely that ADAR2 activity is not sufficient to edit this site completely in motor neurons of patients with sporadic ALS. Because these molecular abnormalities occur in disease- and motor neuron-specific fashion and induce fatal epilepsy in mice, we have hypothesized that GluR2 Q/R site-underediting due to ADAR2 underactivity is a cause of neuronal death in sporadic ALS.

19494808,Editing of serotonin 2C receptor mRNA in the prefrontal cortex characterizes high-novelty locomotor response behavioral trait.,"Serotonin 2C receptor (5-HT(2C)R) exerts a major inhibitory influence on dopamine (DA) neurotransmission within the mesocorticolimbic DA pathway that is implicated in drug reward and goal-directed behaviors. 5-HT(2C)R pre-mRNA undergoes adenosine-to-inosine editing, generating numerous receptor isoforms in brain. As editing influences 5-HT(2C)R activity, individual differences in editing might influence dopaminergic function and, thereby, contribute to interindividual vulnerability to drug addiction. Liability to drug-related behaviors in rats can be predicted by their level of motor activity in response to a novel environment. Rats with a high locomotor response (high responders; HRs) exhibit enhanced acquisition and maintenance of drug self-administration compared to rats with a low response (low responders; LRs). We here examined 5-HT(2C)R mRNA editing and expression in HR and LR phenotypes to investigate the relationship between 5-HT(2C)R function and behavioral traits relevant to drug addiction vulnerability. Three regions of the mesocorticolimbic circuitry (ventral tegmental area (VTA), nucleus accumbens (NuAc) shell, and medial prefrontal cortex (PFC)) were examined. 5-HT(2C)R mRNA expression and editing were significantly higher in the NuAc shell compared with both the PFC and VTA, implying significant differences in function (including constitutive activity) among 5-HT(2C)R neuronal populations within the circuitry. The regional differences in editing could, at least in part, arise from the variations in expression levels of the editing enzyme, ADAR2, and/or from the variations in the ADAR2/ADAR1 ratio observed in the study. No differences in the 5-HT(2C)R expression were detected between the behavioral phenotypes.

PKR catalyzes the RNA-dependent phosphorylation of protein synthesis initiation factor eIF-2 alpha, thereby leading to altered translational patterns in interferon-treated and virus-infected cells. PKR also modulates signal transduction responses, including the induction of interferon. ADAR1 catalyzes the deamination of adenosine (A) to generate inosine (I) in RNAs with double-stranded character. Because I is recognized as G instead of A, A-to-I editing by ADAR1 can lead to genetic recoding and altered RNA structures.

Little is known about the mechanisms that regulate nuclear RNA editing activity. Editing levels show cell-type specific and developmental modulation that does not strictly coincide with observed expression levels of ADARs. Here, we provide evidence for a molecular mechanism that might control nuclear import of specific ADARs and, in turn, nuclear RNA editing. We identify an in vivo ADAR3 interaction partner, importin alpha 1 (KPNA2) that specifically recognizes an arginine-rich ADAR3 sequence motif and show that it acts as a functional nuclear localization sequence. Furthermore, whereas KPNA2, but not KPNA1 or KNPA3, recognizes the ADAR3 NLS, we observe the converse binding specificity with ADAR2. Interestingly, alternative splicing of ADAR2 pre-mRNA introduces an ADAR3-like NLS that alters the interaction profile with the importins. Thus, in vivo RNA editing might be regulated, in part, through controlled subcellular localization of ADARs, which in turn is governed by the coordinated local expression of importin alpha proteins and ADAR protein variants.",2009 Sep,Nucleic Acids Res. 2009 Sep;37(17):5822-9. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkp599.

It has been described that a member of the ADAR family, ADAR1, can target viruses and affect their replication process. Here we report evidence showing that ADAR1 stimulates human immuno deficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication by using both editing-dependent and editing-independent mechanisms. We show that over-expression of ADAR1 in HIV-1 producer cells increases viral protein accumulation in an editing-independent manner. Moreover, HIV-1 virions generated in the presence of over-expressed ADAR1 but not an editing-inactive ADAR1 mutant are released more efficiently and display enhanced infectivity, as demonstrated by challenge assays performed with T cell lines and primary CD4(+) T lymphocytes. Finally, we report that ADAR1 associates with HIV-1 RNAs and edits adenosines in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) and the Rev and Tat coding sequence. Overall these results suggest that HIV-1 has evolved mechanisms to take advantage of specific RNA editing activity of the host cell and disclose a stimulatory function of ADAR1 in the spread of HIV-1.",2009 Sep,Nucleic Acids Res. 2009 Sep;37(17):5848-58. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkp604.

19710021,RNA-specific adenosine deaminase ADAR1 suppresses measles virus-induced apoptosis and activation of protein kinase PKR.,"ADAR1 (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA) catalyzes the conversion of adenosine to inosine, a process known as A-to-I editing. Extensive A-to-I editing has been described in viral RNAs isolated from the brains of patients persistently infected with measles virus, although the precise role of ADAR during measles virus infection remains unknown. We generated human HeLa cells stably deficient in ADAR1 (""ADAR1(kd) cells"") through short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown, and using these cells, we tested the effect of ADAR1 deficiency on measles virus (MVvac strain) growth and virus-induced cell death. We found that the growth of mutant viruses lacking expression of the viral accessory proteins V and C (V(ko) and C(ko), respectively) was decreased in ADAR1-deficient cells compared with ADAR1-sufficient cells. In addition, apoptosis was enhanced in ADAR1-deficient cells following infection with wild type and V(ko) virus but not following infection with C(ko) virus or treatment with tumor necrosis factor-alpha or staurosporine. Furthermore, in C(ko)-infected ADAR1-sufficient cells when ADAR1 did not protect against apoptosis, caspase cleavage of the ADAR1 p150 protein was detected. Finally, enhanced apoptosis in ADAR1(kd) cells following infection with wild type and V(ko) virus correlated with enhanced activation of PKR kinase and interferon regulatory factor IRF-3. Taken together, these results demonstrate that ADAR1 is a proviral, antiapoptotic host factor in the context of measles virus infection and suggest that the antiapoptotic activity of ADAR1 is achieved through suppression of activation of proapoptotic and double-stranded RNA-dependent activities, as exemplified by PKR and IRF-3.",2009 Oct 23,J Biol Chem. 2009 Oct 23;284(43):29350-6. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M109.045146.

19713932,Editing independent effects of ADARs on the miRNA/siRNA pathways.,"Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) are best known for altering the coding sequences of mRNA through RNA editing, as in the GluR-B Q/R site. ADARs have also been shown to affect RNA interference (RNAi) and microRNA processing by deamination of specific adenosines to inosine. Here, we show that ADAR proteins can affect RNA processing independently of their enzymatic activity. We show that ADAR2 can modulate the processing of mir-376a2 independently of catalytic RNA editing activity. In addition, in a Drosophila assay for RNAi deaminase-inactive ADAR1 inhibits RNAi through the siRNA pathway. These results imply that ADAR1 and ADAR2 have biological functions as RNA-binding proteins that extend beyond editing per se and that even genomically encoded ADARs that are catalytically inactive may have such functions.",2009 Oct 21,EMBO J. 2009 Oct 21;28(20):3145-56. doi: 10.1038/emboj.2009.244.

19805087,ADAR1 is required for hematopoietic progenitor cell survival via RNA editing.,"Adenosine Deaminase Acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) is an RNA-editing enzyme that converts adenosine to inosine, following RNA transcription. ADAR1's essential role in embryonic development, especially within the hematopoietic lineage, has been demonstrated in knock-out mice. However, a specific role for ADAR1 in adult hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) remains elusive. In this report, we show that ADAR1 is required for survival of differentiating HPCs as opposed to more primitive cells in adult mice by multiple strategies targeting floxed ADAR1 for deletion by Cre recombinase. As a consequence, ADAR1-deficient hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) were incapable of reconstituting irradiated recipients although being phenotypically present in the recipient bone marrow. While an effect on HSCs cannot be completely ruled out, the preferential effect of ADAR1 absence on HPCs over more primitive hematopoietic cells was consistent with the increased expression of ADAR1 within HPCs, as well as the inability of ADAR1-deficient HPCs to form differentiated colonies and increased apoptotic fraction during ex vivo culture. Moreover, we have obtained direct evidence that ADAR1 functions in HPCs via an RNA-editing dependent mechanism. Therefore, ADAR1 plays an essential role in adult hematopoiesis through its RNA editing activity in HPCs.",2009 Oct 20,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2009 Oct 20;106(42):17763-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0903324106.

19605474,ADAR1 interacts with PKR during human immunodeficiency virus infection of lymphocytes and contributes to viral replication.,"The interferon-induced protein kinase RNA activated (PKR) is activated after virus infection. This activation is transient during the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection of lymphocytes, and the protein is not activated at the peak of infection. We observed that interferon-induced adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1-p150 (ADAR1-p150) and ADAR1-p110 expression increases while the virus replicates actively. Furthermore, both forms of ADAR1 show enhanced interactions with PKR at the peak of HIV infection, suggesting a role for this protein in the regulation of PKR activation. We observed that ADAR1-p150, as previously shown for the TAR RNA binding protein (TRBP), reverses the PKR inhibition of HIV expression and production in HEK 293T cells. This activity requires the Z-DNA binding motif and the three double-stranded RNA binding domains but not the catalytic domain. In astrocytic cells, ADAR1-p150 increased HIV expression and production to an extent similar to that of TRBP. Small interfering RNAs against ADAR1-p150 moderately decreased HIV production. These results indicate that two interferon-induced proteins, ADAR1 and PKR, have antagonistic functions on HIV production. They suggest that ADAR1 and TRBP belong to a multiprotein complex that inhibits PKR during the HIV infection of lymphocytes.",2009 Oct,J Virol. 2009 Oct;83(19):10119-28. doi: 10.1128/JVI.02457-08.

Here, we show that coexpression of ADAR1 in mammalian cells markedly increases plasmid-based gene expression in transfected cells. The enhanced expression was independent of the nature of the promoter (viral and cellular) used to drive gene expression, of the protein reporter (luciferase and RRP) tested, and of the human cell line examined (293T and HeLa). Exogenous protein levels were increased by approximately 20-fold to approximately 50-fold when ADAR1 was coexpressed, whereas RNA transcript levels changed by less than 2-fold. The activation of PKR (protein kinase regulated by RNA) protein kinase and the phosphorylation of translation initiation factor eIF-2alpha seen following plasmid DNA transfection were both greatly reduced in ADAR1-transfected cells. Stable knockdown of the PKR kinase increased reporter gene expression in the absence, but not in the presence, of ADAR1 coexpression. Both size forms of ADAR1-the p150-inducible form and the p110-like constitutive form-enhanced plasmid-based gene expression. Taken together, these results indicate that the ADAR1 deaminase increases exogenous gene expression at the translational level by decreasing PKR-dependent eIF-2alpha phosphorylation.",2009 Nov 6,J Mol Biol. 2009 Nov 6;393(4):777-87. doi: 10.1016/j.jmb.2009.08.070.

19759011,Adenosine-to-inosine genetic recoding is required in the adult stage nervous system for coordinated behavior in Drosophila.,"Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) catalyze the deamination of adenosine to inosine in double-stranded RNA templates, a process known as RNA editing. In Drosophila, multiple ADAR isoforms are generated from a single locus (dAdar) via post-transcriptional modifications. Collectively, these isoforms act to edit a wide range of transcripts involved in neuronal signaling, as well as the precursors of endogenous small interfering RNAs. The phenotypic consequences of a loss of dADAR activity have been well characterized and consist of profound behavioral defects manifested at the adult stage, including extreme uncoordination, seizures, and temperature-sensitive paralysis. However, the spatio-temporal requirements of adenosine to inosine editing for correct behavior are unclear. Using transgenic RNA interference, we show that network-wide editing in the nervous system is required for normal adult locomotion. Regulated restoration of editing activity demonstrates that the neuronal requirement of dADAR activity has a significant adult stage component. Furthermore we show that in relation to behavior there are no observable genetic interactions between dAdar and several loci encoding RNA interference components, suggesting that editing of neuronal transcripts is the key mode of ADAR activity for normal behavior in Drosophila.",2009 Nov 6,J Biol Chem. 2009 Nov 6;284(45):31391-400. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M109.035048.

19941656,Evidence for ADAR-induced hypermutation of the Drosophila sigma virus (Rhabdoviridae).,"BACKGROUND: ADARs are RNA editing enzymes that target double stranded RNA and convert adenosine to inosine, which is read by translation machinery as if it were guanosine. Aside from their role in generating protein diversity in the central nervous system, ADARs have been implicated in the hypermutation of some RNA viruses, although why this hypermutation occurs is not well understood. RESULTS: Here we describe the hypermutation of adenosines to guanosines in the genome of the sigma virus--a negative sense RNA virus that infects Drosophila melanogaster. The clustering of these mutations and the context in which they occur indicates that they have been caused by ADARs. However, ADAR-editing of viral RNA is either rare or edited viral RNA are rapidly degraded, as we only detected evidence for editing in two of the 104 viral isolates we studied. CONCLUSION: This is the first evidence for ADARs targeting viruses outside of mammals, and it raises the possibility that ADARs could play a role in the antiviral defences of insects.",2009 Nov 26,BMC Genet. 2009 Nov 26;10:75. doi: 10.1186/1471-2156-10-75.,"['Carpenter JA', 'Keegan LP', 'Wilfert L', ""O'Connell MA"", 'Jiggins FM']",True
19740768,Recognition and coupling of A-to-I edited sites are determined by the tertiary structure of the RNA.,"Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing has been shown to be an important mechanism that increases protein diversity in the brain of organisms from human to fly. The family of ADAR enzymes converts some adenosines of RNA duplexes to inosines through hydrolytic deamination. The adenosine recognition mechanism is still largely unknown. Here, to investigate it, we analyzed a set of selectively edited substrates with a cluster of edited sites. We used a large set of individual transcripts sequenced by the 454 sequencing technique. On average, we analyzed 570 single transcripts per edited region at four different developmental stages from embryogenesis to adulthood. To our knowledge, this is the first time, large-scale sequencing has been used to determine synchronous editing events. We demonstrate that edited sites are only coupled within specific distances from each other. Furthermore, our results show that the coupled sites of editing are positioned on the same side of a helix, indicating that the three-dimensional structure is key in ADAR enzyme substrate recognition. Finally, we propose that editing by the ADAR enzymes is initiated by their attraction to one principal site in the substrate.",2009 Nov,Nucleic Acids Res. 2009 Nov;37(20):6916-26. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkp731.

We developed an unbiased assay to screen more than 36,000 computationally predicted nonrepetitive A-to-I sites using massively parallel target capture and DNA sequencing. A comprehensive set of several hundred human RNA editing sites was detected by comparing genomic DNA with RNAs from seven tissues of a single individual.

19276205,Human genomic Z-DNA segments probed by the Z alpha domain of ADAR1.,"Double-stranded DNA is a dynamic molecule that adopts different secondary structures. Experimental evidence indicates Z-DNA plays roles in DNA transactions such as transcription, chromatin remodeling and recombination. Furthermore, our computational analysis revealed that sequences with high Z-DNA forming potential at moderate levels of DNA supercoiling are enriched in human promoter regions. However, the actual distribution of Z-DNA segments in genomes of mammalian cells has been elusive due to the unstable nature of Z-DNA and lack of specific probes. Here we present a first human genome map of most stable Z-DNA segments obtained with A549 tumor cells. We used the Z-DNA binding domain, Z alpha, of the RNA editing enzyme ADAR1 as probe in conjunction with a novel chromatin affinity precipitation strategy. By applying stringent selection criteria, we identified 186 genomic Z-DNA hotspots. Interestingly, 46 hotspots were located in centromeres of 13 human chromosomes. There was a very strong correlation between these hotspots and high densities of single nucleotide polymorphism. Our study indicates that genetic instability and rapid evolution of human centromeres might, at least in part, be driven by Z-DNA segments. Contrary to in silico predictions, however, we found that only two of the 186 hotspots were located in promoter regions.",2009 May,Nucleic Acids Res. 2009 May;37(8):2737-46. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkp124.

19124606,RNA-regulated interaction of transportin-1 and exportin-5 with the double-stranded RNA-binding domain regulates nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of ADAR1.,"Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-binding proteins interact with substrate RNAs via dsRNA-binding domains (dsRBDs). Several proteins harboring these domains exhibit nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and possibly remain associated with their substrate RNAs bound in the nucleus during nuclear export. In the human RNA-editing enzyme ADAR1-c, the nuclear localization signal overlaps the third dsRBD, while the corresponding import factor is unknown. The protein also lacks a clear nuclear export signal but shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Here we identify transportin-1 as the import receptor for ADAR1. Interestingly, dsRNA binding interferes with transportin-1 binding. At the same time, each of the dsRBDs in ADAR1 interacts with the export factor exportin-5. RNA binding stimulates this interaction but is not a prerequisite. Thus, our data demonstrate a role for some dsRBDs as RNA-sensitive nucleocytoplasmic transport signals. dsRBD3 in ADAR1 can mediate nuclear import, while interaction of all dsRBDs might control nuclear export. This finding may have implications for other proteins containing dsRBDs and suggests a selective nuclear export mechanism for substrates interacting with these proteins.",2009 Mar,Mol Cell Biol. 2009 Mar;29(6):1487-97. doi: 10.1128/MCB.01519-08.

Transgenic mice misexpressing the RNA editing enzyme ADAR2 show an adult onset obese phenotype due to chronic hyperphagia, but little more than this is known about the behavior of these animals. The present experiments examined whether affect-associated behaviors are also altered in ADAR2 transgenic mice. Age- and weight-matched transgenic mice misexpressing ADAR2 were tested for signs of behavioral despair with the forced swim (FST) and tail suspension (TST) tests, and for anxiety by evaluating spontaneous exploration in a novel environment and by elevated plus maze performance. Plasma corticosterone was also determined by radioimmunoassay. Transgenic mice of both sexes displayed indications of increased behavioral despair on first exposures to the TST and the FST. Behavioral despair persisted in ADAR2 mice in that it was also observed in the FST in tests administered 24 h and 1 week following the initial TST and FST. ADAR2 transgenic mice also displayed behaviors associated with anxiety as indicated by decreased entry into the open arms in an elevated plus maze test. Both sexes of ADAR2 transgenic mice displayed elevated plasma corticosterone.

19390115,An extra double-stranded RNA binding domain confers high activity to a squid RNA editing enzyme.,"RNA editing by adenosine deamination is particularly prevalent in the squid nervous system. We hypothesized that the squid editing enzyme might contain structural differences that help explain this phenomenon. As a first step, a squid adenosine deaminase that acts on RNA (sqADAR2a) cDNA and the gene that encodes it were cloned from the giant axon system. PCR and RNase protection assays showed that a splice variant of this clone (sqADAR2b) was also expressed in this tissue. Both versions are homologous to the vertebrate ADAR2 family. sqADAR2b encodes a conventional ADAR2 family member with an evolutionarily conserved deaminase domain and two double-stranded RNA binding domains (dsRBD). sqADAR2a differs from sqADAR2b by containing an optional exon that encodes an ""extra"" dsRBD. Both splice variants are expressed at comparable levels and are extensively edited, each in a unique pattern. Recombinant sqADAR2a and sqADAR2b, produced in Pichia pastoris, are both active on duplex RNA. Using a standard 48-h protein induction, both sqADAR2a and sqADAR2b exhibit promiscuous self-editing; however, this activity is particularly robust for sqADAR2a. By decreasing the induction time to 16 h, self-editing was mostly eliminated. We next tested the ability of sqADAR2a and sqADAR2b to edit two K+ channel mRNAs in vitro. Both substrates are known to be edited in squid. For each mRNA, sqADAR2a edited many more sites than sqADAR2b. These data suggest that the ""extra"" dsRBD confers high activity on sqADAR2a.",2009 Jun,RNA. 2009 Jun;15(6):1208-18. doi: 10.1261/rna.1471209.

19383766,The fraction of RNA that folds into the correct branched secondary structure determines hepatitis delta virus type 3 RNA editing levels.,"RNA editing by the host RNA adenosine deaminase ADAR1 at the amber/W site of hepatitis delta virus RNA plays a central role in the viral replication cycle by affecting the balance between viral RNA synthesis and packaging. Previously, we found that HDV genotype III (HDV-3) RNA can form two secondary structures following transcription: an unbranched rod structure, which is characteristic of HDV, and a metastable branched structure that serves as the substrate for editing. The unstable nature of the branched editing substrate structure raised the possibility that structural dynamics of the RNA following transcription could determine the rate at which editing occurs. Here, editing and its control are examined in two HDV-3 isolates, from Peru and Ecuador. Analysis of editing in vitro by ADAR1 indicated that the branched structure formed by RNA derived from the Peruvian isolate is edited more efficiently than that from the Ecuadorian isolate. In contrast, in the context of replication, Peruvian RNA is edited less efficiently than RNA containing Ecuadorian sequences. Computational analyses of RNA folding using the massively parallel genetic algorithm (MPGAfold) indicated that the Peruvian RNA is less likely to form the branched structure required for editing than the Ecuadorian isolate. This difference was confirmed by in vitro transcription of these RNAs. Overall, our data indicate that HDV-3 controls RNA editing levels via (1) the fraction of the RNA that folds, during transcription, into the metastable branched structure required for editing and (2) the efficiency with which ADAR1 edits this branched substrate RNA.",2009 Jun,RNA. 2009 Jun;15(6):1177-87. doi: 10.1261/rna.1504009.

The efficiency of editing for 28 different sites was analyzed during the development of the mouse brain from embryogenesis to adulthood. We show that, with few exceptions, the editing efficiency is low during embryogenesis, increasing gradually at different rates up to the adult mouse. The variation in editing gave receptors like HTR2C and GABA(A) (gamma-aminobutyric acid type A) a different set of protein isoforms during development from those in the adult animal. Furthermore, we show that this regulation of editing activity cannot be explained by an altered expression of the ADAR proteins but, rather, by the presence of a regulatory network that controls the editing activity during development.",2009 Jun,Genome Res. 2009 Jun;19(6):978-86. doi: 10.1101/gr.089409.108.

Because genes involved in the interferon-alpha pathway may affect antiviral responses, we analyzed the relationship between variants in these genes and SVR among participants in the Hepatitis C Antiviral Long-Term treatment Against Cirrhosis (HALT-C) trial. Patients had advanced chronic hepatitis C that had previously failed to respond to interferon-based treatment. Participants were treated with peginterferon-alpha2a and ribavirin during the trial. Subjects with undetectable HCV RNA at week 72 were considered to have had an SVR. Subjects with detectable HCV RNA at week 20 were considered nonresponders. We used TaqMan assays to genotype 56 polymorphisms found in 13 genes in the interferon-alpha pathway. This analysis compares genotypes for participants with an SVR to nonresponders. The primary analysis was restricted to European American participants because a priori statistical power was low among the small number (n = 131) of African American patients. We used logistic regression to control the effect of other variables that are associated with treatment response. Among 581 European American patients, SVR was associated with IFNAR1 IVS1-22G (adjusted odds ratio, 0.57; P = 0.02); IFNAR2 Ex2-33C (adjusted odds ratio, 2.09; P = 0.02); JAK1 IVS22+112T (adjusted odds ratio, 1.66; P = 0.04); and ADAR Ex9+14A (adjusted odds ratio, 1.67; P = 0.03).

Identification of more ADAR targets and genome sequences of diverse eukaryotes present an opportunity to elucidate the origin and evolution of ADAR-mediated RNA editing. Comparative analysis of the adenosine deaminase family indicates that the first ADAR might have evolved from adenosine deaminases acting on tRNAs after the split of protozoa and metazoa. ADAR1 and ADAR2 arose by gene duplications in early metazoan evolution, approximately 700 million years ago, while ADAR3 and TENR might originate after Urochordata-Vertebrata divergence. More ADAR or ADAR-like genes emerged in some animals (e.g., fish). Considering the constrained structure, ADAR targets are proposed to have evolved from transposable elements and repeats, random selection, and fixation, and intermolecular pairs of sense and antisense RNA. In some degree, increased ADAR-mediated gene regulation should substantially contribute to the emergence and evolution of complex metazoans, particularly the nervous system.",2009 Jun,IUBMB Life. 2009 Jun;61(6):572-8. doi: 10.1002/iub.207.,"['Jin Y', 'Zhang W', 'Li Q']",True

The best growth performance was obtained by operating the system at a superficial velocity of 0.4 cms(-1) and with a downcomer-to-riser cross-sectional area ratio of 0.4.

It has been shown that deregulation of RNA editing of several mRNAs plays a causative role in diseases of the central nervous system such as depression. We analyzed the effects of eight antidepressants on GluR2 Q/R site-RNA editing in a modified HeLa cell line that stably expresses half-edited GluR2 pre-mRNA. We also measured changes in RNA expression levels of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA type 2 (ADAR2), the specific RNA editing enzyme of the GluR2 Q/R site, and GluR2, in order to assess the molecular mechanism causing alteration of this site-editing. The editing efficiency at the GluR2 Q/R site was significantly increased after treatment with seven out of eight antidepressants at a concentration of no more than 10 microM for 24h. The relative abundance of ADAR2 mRNA to GluR2 pre-mRNA or to beta-actin mRNA was increased after treatment with six of the effective antidepressants, whereas it was unchanged after treatment with milnacipran. Our results suggest that antidepressants have the potency to enhance GluR2 Q/R site-editing by either upregulating the ADAR2 mRNA expression level or other unidentified mechanisms. It may be worth investigating the in vivo efficacy of antidepressants with a specific therapeutic strategy for sporadic ALS in view.",2009 Jul,Neurosci Res. 2009 Jul;64(3):251-8. doi: 10.1016/j.neures.2009.03.009.

19253308,New bioinformatics approach to analyze gene expressions and signaling pathways reveals unique purine gene dysregulation profiles that distinguish between CD and UC.,"BACKGROUND: Expression of purine genes is modulated by inflammation or experimental colitis and altered expression leads to disrupted gut function. We studied purine gene dysregulation profiles in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and determined whether they can distinguish between Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) using Pathway Analysis and a new Comparative Analysis of Gene Expression and Selection (CAGES) method. METHODS: Raw datasets for 22 purine genes and 36 probe-sets from National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/) were analyzed by National Cancer Institute (NCI) Biological Resources Branch (BRB) array tools for random-variance of multiple/36 t-tests in colonic mucosal biopsies or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of CD, UC or control subjects. Dysregulation occurs in 59% of purine genes in IBD including ADORA3, CD73, ADORA2A, ADORA2B, ADAR, AMPD2, AMPD3, DPP4, P2RY5, P2RY6, P2RY13, P2RY14, and P2RX5. RESULTS: In CD biopsies, expression of ADORA3, AMPD3, P2RY13, and P2RY5 were negatively correlated with acute inflammatory score, Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) or disease chronicity; P2RY14 was positively correlated in UC. In mucosal biopsies or PBMCs, CD and UC were distinguished by unique patterns of dysregulation (up- or downregulation) in purine genes. Purine gene dysregulation differs between PBMCs and biopsies and possibly between sexes for each disease. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) revealed significant associations between alterations in the expression of CD73 (upregulation) or ADORA3 (downregulation) and inflammatory or purine genes (<or=10% of 57 genes) as well as G-protein coupled receptors, cAMP-dependent, and inflammatory pathways; IPA distinguishes CD from UC. CONCLUSION: CAGES and Pathway Analysis provided novel evidence that UC and CD have distinct purine gene dysregulation signatures in association with inflammation, cAMP, or other signaling pathways. Disease-specific purine gene signature profiles and pathway associations may be of therapeutic, diagnostic, and functional relevance.",2009 Jul,Inflamm Bowel Dis. 2009 Jul;15(7):971-84. doi: 10.1002/ibd.20893.,"['Rybaczyk L', 'Rozmiarek A', 'Circle K', 'Grants I', 'Needleman B', 'Wunderlich JE', 'Huang K', 'Christofi FL']",True

DRBP's do not recognize specific nucleotide sequences and primarily interact with approximately 11-16 base pairs present within A-form double helix RNAs, which can include ssRNA's with extensive secondary structure. The DRBP family include TRBP (TAR RNA binding protein), PKR (protein kinase activated by dsRNA), PACT (Protein Activator of PKR), ADAR (Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA), and the RNase III family including DICER, which collectively play important roles in mRNA elongation, RNA interference (RNAi), mRNA editing, stability, splicing and/or export and translation. Here, we focus on the role of DRBP's referred to as the NFARs (Nuclear Factors associated with dsRNA) which are translated from two major alternatively spliced products encoded from a single gene. Evidence indicates that the NFAR proteins play crucial roles in mRNA post-transcriptional regulation, including mRNA stability, export and translation and may also have an important function in host defense.",2009 Jan-Mar,RNA Biol. 2009 Jan-Mar;6(1):35-9. doi: 10.4161/rna.6.1.7565.

To obtain a high packed-bed volume relative to the whole bioreactor volume, a high A(D)/A(R) ratio was used. Reactor's downcomer was packed with a porous support of volcanic stone fragments. PB-ALR hydrodynamics and oxygen mass transfer behavior was evaluated and compared to the observed behavior of the unpacked reactor operating as an internal airlift reactor (ALR). Overall gas holdup values epsilon(G), and zonal oxygen mass transfer coefficients determined at various airflow rates in the PB-ALR, were higher than those obtained with the ALR. When comparing mixing time values obtained in both cases, a slight increment in mixing time was observed when reactor was operated as a PB-ALR. By using a mixed microbial community, the biofilm reactor was used to evaluate the aerobic biodegradation of 2,4,6-TCP. Three bacterial strains identified as Burkholderia sp., Burkholderia kururiensis and Stenotrophomonas sp. constituted the microbial consortium able to cometabolically degrade the 2,4,6-TCP, using phenol as primary substrate. This consortium removed 100% of phenol and near 99% of 2,4,6-TCP. Mineralization and dehalogenation of 2,4,6-TCP was evidenced by high COD removal efficiencies ( approximately 95%), and by the stoichiometric release of chloride ions from the halogenated compound ( approximately 80%). Finally, it was observed that the microbial consortium was also capable to metabolize 2,4,6-TCP without phenol as primary substrate, with high removal efficiencies (near 100% for 2,4,6-TCP, 92% for COD and 88% for chloride ions).",2009 Jan 30,J Hazard Mater. 2009 Jan 30;161(2-3):1140-9. doi: 10.1016/j.jhazmat.2008.04.077.

The binding of Z alpha to foreign or chromosomal DNA in various sequence contexts is known to influence various biological functions, including the DNA-mediated innate immune response and transcriptional modulation of gene expression. For these reasons, understanding its binding mode and the conformational diversity of Z alpha bound Z-DNAs is of considerable importance. However, structural studies of Z alpha bound Z-DNA have been mostly limited to standard CG-repeat DNAs. Here, we have solved the crystal structures of three representative non-CG repeat DNAs, d(CACGTG)(2), d(CGTACG)(2) and d(CGGCCG)(2) complexed to hZ alpha(ADAR1) and compared those structures with that of hZ alpha(ADAR1)/d(CGCGCG)(2) and the Z alpha-free Z-DNAs. hZ alpha(ADAR1) bound to each of the three Z-DNAs showed a well conserved binding mode with very limited structural deviation irrespective of the DNA sequence, although varying numbers of residues were in contact with Z-DNA. Z-DNAs display less structural alterations in the Z alpha-bound state than in their free form, thereby suggesting that conformational diversities of Z-DNAs are restrained by the binding pocket of Z alpha. These data suggest that Z-DNAs are recognized by Z alpha through common conformational features regardless of the sequence and structural alterations.",2009 Feb,Nucleic Acids Res. 2009 Feb;37(2):629-37. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkn976.

We present a perspective of ADARs interaction with the non-coding transcriptome as a computational matrix, enhancing the information processing power of the cell, adding flexibility, rapid response, and fine tuning to critical pathways.

19776031,Adenosine deamination in human transcripts generates novel microRNA binding sites.,"Animals regulate gene expression at multiple levels, contributing to the complexity of the proteome. Among these regulatory events are post-transcriptional gene silencing, mediated by small non-coding RNAs (e.g. microRNAs), and adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing, generated by adenosine deaminases that act on double-stranded RNA (ADAR). Recent data suggest that these regulatory processes are connected at a fundamental level. A-to-I editing can affect Drosha processing or directly alter the microRNA (miRNA) sequences responsible for mRNA targeting. Here, we analyzed the previously reported adenosine deaminations occurring in human cDNAs, and asked if there was a relationship between A-to-I editing events in the mRNA 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) and mRNA:miRNA binding. We find significant correlations between A-to-I editing and changes in miRNA complementarities. In all, over 3000 of the 12 723 distinct adenosine deaminations assessed were found to form 7-mer complementarities (known as seed matches) to a subset of human miRNAs. In 200 of the ESTs, we also noted editing within a specific 13 nucleotide motif. Strikingly, deamination of this motif simultaneously creates seed matches to three (otherwise unrelated) miRNAs. Our results suggest the creation of miRNA regulatory sites as a novel function for ADAR activity. Consequently, many miRNA target sites may only be identifiable through examining expressed sequences.",2009 Dec 15,Hum Mol Genet. 2009 Dec 15;18(24):4801-7. doi: 10.1093/hmg/ddp443.

Due to the occurrence of bias in the direction of mutation, these differences and those found in nucleotide sequences of different isolates of the minor component in the vaccine (MuV(JL2)) might be due to the effect of ADAR-like deaminases on MuV grown in tissue-cultured cells. A molecular clone of MuV(JL2) (pMuV(JL2)) and MuV(JL2)-specific helper plasmids were constructed in order to investigate molecular interactions between MuV(JL5) and MuV(JL2), to augment the existing molecular clone of MuV(JL5) (pMuV(JL5)) and MuV(JL5)-specific helper plasmids.

19720447,Spatial and temporal expression of dADAR mRNA and protein isoforms during embryogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster.,"Adenosine Deaminases Acting on RNA (ADARs) function to co-transcriptionally deaminate specific (or non-specific) adenosines to inosines within pre-mRNAs, using double-stranded RNAs as substrate. In both Drosophila and mammals, the best-studied ADAR functions are to catalyze specific nucleotide conversions within mRNAs encoding various ligand- or voltage-gated ion channel proteins within the adult brain. In contrast, ADARs within developing fly embryos have scarcely been studied, in part because they contain little or no editase activity, raising interesting questions as to their functional significance. Quantitative RT-PCR shows that two major developmentally regulated mRNA isoform classes are produced (full-length and truncated), which arise by alternative splicing and also alternative 3'-end formation. In situ localization of specific dADAR mRNA isoforms during embryogenesis reveals that the full-length class is found primarily within the developing germ band and central nervous system, whereas the truncated isoform is mostly located in gut endothelium. Developmental Western immunoblots show that both isoform classes are expressed into protein during embryogenesis. Both the rnp-4f 5'-UTR unspliced isoform and the full-length dADAR mRNA primarily localize in the embryonic germ band and subsequently throughout the developing central nervous system. Previous studies have shown that some rnp-4f pre-mRNAs are extensively edited by dADAR in the adult brain. Computer predictions suggest that intron-exon pairing promotes formation of an evolutionarily conserved secondary structure in the rnp-4f 5'-UTR, forming a 177-nt RNA duplex resembling an editing site complementary sequence, which is shown to be associated with splicing failure and to generate a long isoform. Taken together, these observations led us to explore the possibility that interaction between rnp-4f pre-mRNA and nuclear full-length dADAR protein may occur during embryogenesis. In dADAR null mutants, rnp-4f 5'-UTR alternative splicing is significantly diminished, suggesting a non-catalytic role for dADAR in splicing regulation. A working model is proposed which provides a possible molecular mechanism.",2009 Dec,Differentiation. 2009 Dec;78(5):312-20. doi: 10.1016/j.diff.2009.08.003.

Here we present recent efforts to define structure/activity relationships for the ADAR reaction. We describe the synthesis of new phosphoramidites for the incorporation of 7-substituted-8-aza-7-deazaadenosine derivatives into RNA. These reagents were used to introduce the analogues into mimics of the R/G-editing site found in the pre-mRNA for the human glutamate receptor B subunit (GluR B). Analysis of the kinetics of the ADAR2 reaction with analogue-containing RNAs indicated 8-aza-7-deazaadenosine is an excellent substrate for this enzyme with a deamination rate eight times greater than that for adenosine. However, replacing the C7 hydrogen in this analogue with bromine, iodine, or propargyl alcohol failed to increase the deamination rate further but rather decreased the rate. Modeling of nucleotide binding in the enzyme active site suggested amino acid residues that may be involved in nucleotide recognition. We carried out a functional screen of a library of ADAR2 mutants expressed in S. cerevisiae that varied the identity of these residues to identify active deaminases with altered active sites. One of these mutants (ADAR2 R455A) was able to substantially overcome the inhibitory effect of the bulky C7 substituents (-Br, -I, propargyl alcohol).

19637911,NMR spectroscopic elucidation of the B-Z transition of a DNA double helix induced by the Z alpha domain of human ADAR1.,"The human RNA editing enzyme ADAR1 (double-stranded RNA deaminase I) deaminates adenine in pre-mRNA to yield inosine, which codes as guanine. ADAR1 has two left-handed Z-DNA binding domains, Z alpha and Z beta, at its NH(2)-terminus and preferentially binds Z-DNA, rather than B-DNA, with high binding affinity. The cocrystal structure of Z alpha(ADAR1) complexed to Z-DNA showed that one monomeric Z alpha(ADAR1) domain binds to one strand of double-stranded DNA and a second Z alpha(ADAR1) monomer binds to the opposite strand with 2-fold symmetry with respect to DNA helical axis. It remains unclear how Z alpha(ADAR1) protein specifically recognizes Z-DNA sequence in a sea of B-DNA to produce the stable Z alpha(ADAR1)-Z-DNA complex during the B-Z transition induced by Z alpha(ADAR1). In order to characterize the molecular recognition of Z-DNA by Z alpha(ADAR1), we performed circular dichroism (CD) and NMR experiments with complexes of Zalpha(ADAR1) bound to d(CGCGCG)(2) (referred to as CG6) produced at a variety of protein-to-DNA molar ratios. From this study, we identified the intermediate states of the CG6-Z alpha(ADAR1) complex and calculated their relative populations as a function of the Z alpha(ADAR1) concentration.

Here, we report that up-regulation of inducible ADAR1 p150 isoform in macrophages stimulated with LPS and in AMs harvested from an ALI rat model. Knockdown of ADAR1 p150 by small interfering RNA in AMs suppressed macrophage inflammatory protein 1 (MIP-1) secretion while enhancing that of IL-10 compared with those control cells upon LPS stimulation. To further confirm the role of p150 in AMs, adoptive transfer of LPS-activated NR8383 cells was performed in healthy rats, and severity of inflammatory response was assessed by investigating cellular pattern in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and calculating alveolar-arterial oxygen difference [D(A-a)O2]. Acute lung injury was induced by LPS-activated NR8383 cells with either normal or lower ADAR1 expression levels, and ALI in rats and the lung inflammation was attenuated significantly by knockdown ADAR1 p150 in transferred cells both in polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltration and D(A-a)O2. The roles of MIP-1 and IL-10 in the development of ALI were also tested in animals receiving neutralizing antibodies. Administration of anti-MIP-1 inhibited lung polymorphonuclear leukocytes infiltration and lung damage, as well as D(A-a)O2, whereas anti-IL-10 reversed the protection effects. In conclusion, ADAR1 p150 is functionally significant in the development of ALI.

19739398,Mechanisms of induction and action of interferons.,"Since the discovery that interferons responses constitute an efficient transition between innate and adaptive immunity to infectious microorganisms, the function and role of these cytokines are better understood. Interferons act on specific cell receptors, which activate well-defined transduction pathways to enhance the expression of hundreds of different Interferon-Stimulated Genes (ISGs) leading to the so-called antiviral state. Several of these genes including those encoding proteins (such as PKR, OAS, and ADAR1) depending on the presence of intracellular double stranded RNA for the activation of their enzymatic function, were studied in more detail. Considerable progress has been made recently in understanding how type I interferons expression is induced in response to virus infection. These imply several Toll-like Receptors (TLRs) and several newly described cytoplasmic protein sensors (RIG-I, MDA5, DAI) that detect the presence of viral nucleic acids and transduce intracellular signals leading to the activation of several members of the family of interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) required for the expression of type I interferons or directly some of the ISGs themselves. The discovery of these transduction pathways derives largely from the study of gene deficient cells and animals. The importance of these proteins is further attested by the discovery of several virally encoded antagonists that can interrupt specifically various steps of either the induction or the action of type I interferons.",2009,Verh K Acad Geneeskd Belg. 2009;71(1-2):51-71.,['Content J'],False
19941396,Identification of cellular partners of Influenza A virus (H5N1) non-structural protein NS1 by yeast two-hybrid system.,"Influenza A virus (IAV) subtype H5N1 is associated with the re-emergence of severe human influenza. The virus is highly virulent and viral non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is believed to play a crucial role in the viral pathogenesis. A screening for human proteins interacting with NS1 was performed by a yeast two-hybrid system (Y2H). Two bait plasmids that expressed DNA binding domain (BD) fused to either RNA binding domain or to effector domain of NS1 were constructed and transformed into yeast. The bait yeast was mated with a prey yeast containing human macrophage cDNA library fused to DNA activation domain. Obtained clones were interacting with interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R), MHC class I HLA-B, cathepsin B, ubiquitin, and adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR1). These proteins play important role in the immune response, targeting for proteosomal degradation, and RNA editing. Thus, IAV H5N1 may use NS1 to manipulate these host proteins for its own benefit and in that way confer an unusual severity to the infection.",2009,Acta Virol. 2009;53(3):153-9. doi: 10.4149/av_2009_03_153.,"['Ngamurulert S', 'Limjindaporn T', 'Auewaraku P']",False
19156214,Novel exon of mammalian ADAR2 extends open reading frame.,"BACKGROUND: The post-transcriptional processing of pre-mRNAs by RNA editing contributes significantly to the complexity of the mammalian transcriptome. RNA editing by site-selective A-to-I modification also regulates protein function through recoding of genomically specified sequences. The adenosine deaminase ADAR2 is the main enzyme responsible for recoding editing and loss of ADAR2 function in mice leads to a phenotype of epilepsy and premature death. Although A-to-I RNA editing is known to be subject to developmental and cell-type specific regulation, there is little knowledge regarding the mechanisms that regulate RNA editing in vivo. Therefore, the characterization of ADAR expression and identification of alternative ADAR variants is an important prerequisite for understanding the mechanisms for regulation of RNA editing and the causes for deregulation in disease. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we present evidence for a new ADAR2 splice variant that extends the open reading frame of ADAR2 by 49 amino acids through the utilization of an exon located 18 kilobases upstream of the previously annotated first coding exon and driven by a candidate alternative promoter. Interestingly, the 49 amino acid extension harbors a sequence motif that is closely related to the R-domain of ADAR3 where it has been shown to function as a basic, single-stranded RNA binding domain. Quantitative expression analysis shows that expression of the novel ADAR2 splice variant is tissue specific being highest in the cerebellum. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The strong sequence conservation of the ADAR2 R-domain between human, mouse and rat ADAR2 genes suggests a conserved function for this isoform of the RNA editing enzyme.",2009,PLoS One. 2009;4(1):e4225. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0004225.

19325227,ADAR1 and ADAR2 expression and editing activity during forebrain development.,"The conversion of adenosine to inosine within RNA transcripts is regulated by a family of double-stranded RNA-specific adenosine deaminases referred to as adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADARs). Little is known regarding the developmental expression of ADAR family members or the mechanisms responsible for the specific patterns of editing observed for ADAR substrates. We have examined the spatiotemporal expression patterns for ADAR1 and ADAR2 in mouse forebrain. ADAR1 and ADAR2 are broadly distributed in most regions of the mouse forebrain by P0, including the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and diencephalon. High expression levels were maintained into adulthood. Colocalization studies demonstrated ADAR1 and ADAR2 expression in neurons but not astrocytes. Editing for specific ADAR mRNA targets precedes high expression of ADAR proteins, suggesting that region-specific differences in editing patterns may not be mediated solely by ADAR expression levels.",2009,Dev Neurosci. 2009;31(3):223-37. doi: 10.1159/000210185.

18971634,Newly identified ADAR-mediated A-to-I editing positions as a tool for ALS research.,"Among the extensively occurring adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) conversions in RNA, RNA editing at the GluR2 Q/R site is crucial for the survival of mammalian organisms. Editing at this site is incomplete in the motor neurons of patients with sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA type 2 (ADAR2) specifically mediates GluR2 Q/R site-editing, hence, it is likely a molecule relevant to the pathogenesis of sporadic ALS. Since no other transcript with ADAR2-mediated A-to-I positions is abundantly expressed in most neurons, the editors at the newly identified A-to-I positions were investigated. CYFIP2 and FLNA mRNAs were identified together with mRNAs having known ADAR2-mediated editing positions in ADAR2-immunoprecipitates of the human cerebellum, indicating that these mRNAs probably possessed ADAR2-mediated positions. Furthermore, an in vitro RNAi knockdown system demonstrated that the CYFIP2 mRNA K/E site and the BLCAP mRNA Y/C site were edited predominantly by ADAR2 and ADAR1, respectively. CYFIP2 mRNA was ubiquitously expressed and particularly abundant in the central nervous system. The extent of CYFIP2 K/E site-editing was between 30% and 80% in the central nervous system. Therefore, the extent of CYFIP2 K/E site-editing may be an additional marker for ADAR2 activity in neuronal and other types of cells in vivo, as well as in vitro, and thus is considered to be a good tool for sporadic ALS research.",2008 Oct-Dec,RNA Biol. 2008 Oct-Dec;5(4):193-7. doi: 10.4161/rna.6925.

18708348,RNA editing of androgen receptor gene transcripts in prostate cancer cells.,"Reactivation of the androgen receptor (AR) signaling pathway represents a critical step in the growth and survival of androgen-independent (AI) prostate cancer (CaP). In this study we show the DU145 and PC3 AI human CaP cell lines respond to androgens and require AR expression for optimal proliferation in vitro. Interestingly, AR gene transcripts in DU145 and PC3 cells harbored a large number of single base pair nucleotide transitions that resulted in missense mutations in selected AR codons. The most notable lesion detected in AR gene transcripts included the oncogenic codon 877T-->A gain-of-function mutation. Surprisingly, AR gene transcript nucleotide transitions were not genome-encoded substitutions, but instead the mutations co-localized to putative A-to-I, U-to-C, C-to-U, and G-to-A RNA editing sites, suggesting the lesions were mediated through RNA editing mechanisms. Higher levels of mRNA encoding the A-to-I RNA editing enzymes ADAR1 and ADARB1 were observed in DU145 and PC3 cells relative to the androgen-responsive LNCaP and 22Rv1 human CaP cell lines, which correlated with higher levels of AR gene transcript A-to-I editing detected in DU145 and PC3 cells. Our results suggest that AR gene transcripts are targeted by different RNA editing enzymes in DU145 and PC3 cells. Thus RNA editing of AR gene transcripts may contribute to the etiology of hormone-refractory phenotypes in advanced stage AI CaP.",2008 Oct 31,J Biol Chem. 2008 Oct 31;283(44):29938-49. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M800534200.

18950506,Meta-analysis of genome-wide expression patterns associated with behavioral maturation in honey bees.,"BACKGROUND: The information from multiple microarray experiments can be integrated in an objective manner via meta-analysis. However, multiple meta-analysis approaches are available and their relative strengths have not been directly compared using experimental data in the context of different gene expression scenarios and studies with different degrees of relationship. This study investigates the complementary advantages of meta-analysis approaches to integrate information across studies, and further mine the transcriptome for genes that are associated with complex processes such as behavioral maturation in honey bees. Behavioral maturation and division of labor in honey bees are related to changes in the expression of hundreds of genes in the brain. The information from various microarray studies comparing the expression of genes at different maturation stages in honey bee brains was integrated using complementary meta-analysis approaches. RESULTS: Comparison of lists of genes with significant differential expression across studies failed to identify genes with consistent patterns of expression that were below the selected significance threshold, or identified genes with significant yet inconsistent patterns. The meta-analytical framework supported the identification of genes with consistent overall expression patterns and eliminated genes that exhibited contradictory expression patterns across studies. Sample-level meta-analysis of normalized gene-expression can detect more differentially expressed genes than the study-level meta-analysis of estimates for genes that were well described by similar model parameter estimates across studies and had small variation across studies. Furthermore, study-level meta-analysis was well suited for genes that exhibit consistent patterns across studies, genes that had substantial variation across studies, and genes that did not conform to the assumptions of the sample-level meta-analysis. Meta-analyses confirmed previously reported genes and helped identify genes (e.g. Tomosyn, Chitinase 5, Adar, Innexin 2, Transferrin 1, Sick, Oatp26F) and Gene Ontology categories (e.g. purine nucleotide binding) not previously associated with maturation in honey bees. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that a combination of meta-analytical approaches best addresses the highly dimensional nature of genome-wide microarray studies. As expected, the integration of gene expression information from microarray studies using meta-analysis enhanced the characterization of the transcriptome of complex biological processes.",2008 Oct 24,BMC Genomics. 2008 Oct 24;9:503. doi: 10.1186/1471-2164-9-503.,"['Adams HA', 'Southey BR', 'Robinson GE', 'Rodriguez-Zas SL']",False

Only three cases with neurological disorders have been reported, although more than 50 mutations of the ADAR1 gene causing DSH have been reported and none of them had any neurological symptoms.

To understand the function of extensive double-stranded 3' UTR structures, and the inosines within them, we monitored the fate of reporter and endogenous mRNAs that include structured 3' UTRs in wild-type Caenorhabditis elegans and in strains with mutations in the ADAR genes. In general, we saw little effect of editing on stability or translatability of mRNA, although in one case an ADR-1 dependent effect was observed. Importantly, whereas previous studies indicate that inosine-containing RNAs are retained in the nucleus, we show that both C. elegans and Homo sapiens mRNAs with edited, structured 3' UTRs are present on translating ribosomes.",2008 Oct,RNA. 2008 Oct;14(10):2050-60. doi: 10.1261/rna.1165008.

18780728,ADBP-1 regulates an ADAR RNA-editing enzyme to antagonize RNA-interference-mediated gene silencing in Caenorhabditis elegans.,"Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) mediate gene silencing through evolutionarily conserved pathways. In Caenorhabditis elegans, the siRNA/miRNA pathways are also known to affect transgene expression. To identify genes that regulate the efficiencies of the siRNA/miRNA pathways, we used the expression level of a transgene as an indicator of gene silencing and isolated a transgene-silencing mutant, adbp-1 (ADR-2 binding protein). The adbp-1 mutation caused transgene silencing in hypodermal and intestinal cells in a cell-autonomous manner, depending on the RNA interference (RNAi) machinery. The adbp-1 gene encodes a protein with no conserved domains that is localized in the nucleus. Yeast two-hybrid screening and co-immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that ADBP-1 physically interacts with ADR-2, an RNA-editing enzyme from the ADAR (adenosine deaminase acting on dsRNA) family. In the adbp-1 mutant, as previously shown in adr-2 mutants, A-to-I RNA editing was not detected, suggesting that ADBP-1 is required for the RNA-editing activity of ADR-2. We found that ADBP-1 facilitates the nuclear localization of ADR-2. ADBP-1 may regulate ADR-2 activity and the consequent RNA editing and thereby antagonize RNAi-mediated transgene silencing in C. elegans.",2008 Oct,Genetics. 2008 Oct;180(2):785-96. doi: 10.1534/genetics.108.093310.

We and other investigators demonstrated altered expression of adenosine deaminase that act on RNA (ADAR) genes in SLE patients. Based on this information, we hypothesize that the altered expression and function of ADAR enzymes is a mechanism for the immunopathogenesis of SLE. ADARs edit gene transcripts through site-specific conversion of adenosine to inosine by hydrolytic deamination at C6 of the adenosine. Thirteen SLE subjects and eight healthy controls were studied. We assessed the role of ADAR enzymes in editing of PDE8A1 gene transcripts of normal and SLE T cells. These studies demonstrated the occurrence of ADAR-catalysed altered and site-selective editing profile of specific sites in the PDE8A1 gene transcripts of normal and SLE T cells. Two hot spots for A to I editing were observed in the PDE8A1 transcripts of normal and SLE T cells. A fundamental finding of this study is A to I hypo-editing followed by up-regulation of PDE8A1 transcripts in SLE T cells. These results are confirmed by analysing PDE8A1 transcripts of normal T cells activated with type I interferon-alpha. It is proposed that, the altered expression of ADAR enzymes tilt the balance of editing machinery and alter editing in SLE transcriptome. Such altered editing may contribute to the modulation of gene regulation and ultimately, immune functions in SLE and play an important role in the initiation and propagation of SLE pathogenesis.",2008 Nov,Immunology. 2008 Nov;125(3):408-19. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2567.2008.02850.x.

Knockdown of ADAR1 by RNA silencing inhibited HIV-1 production. Viral RNA harvested from transfected ADAR1-knocked-down cells showed a decrease in the level of unspliced RNA transcripts. Overexpression of ADAR1 induced editing at a specific site in the env gene, and a mutant with the edited sequence was expressed more efficiently than the wild-type viral genome.

We find a decrease in ADAR2 editing activity that seems to correlate with the grade of malignancy in children. Despite the loss of ADAR2 editing activity in tumor tissues, the high grade astrocytomas do not exhibit alterations in ADAR2 expression when compared with their specific control tissues. However, high expression levels of ADAR1 and ADAR3 were found in tumors when compared with normal tissues dissected in the same area of the brain. We reintroduced either ADAR2 or the inactive version of ADAR2 in three astrocytoma cell lines (U118, A172, U87). The ""reverted"" editing status is necessary and sufficient for a significant decrease in cell malignant behavior as measured by proliferation, cell cycle, and migration assays.

Here, we show that a pair of inverted Alus placed within the 3'-UTR of egfp reporter mRNA strongly represses EGFP expression, whereas a single Alu has little or no effect. Importantly, the observed silencing correlates with A-to-I RNA editing, nuclear retention of the mRNA and its association with the protein p54(nrb). Further, we show that inverted Alu elements can act in a similar fashion in their natural chromosomal context to silence the adjoining gene. For example, the Nicolin 1 gene expresses multiple mRNA isoforms differing in the 3'-UTR. One isoform that contains the inverted repeat is retained in the nucleus, whereas another lacking these sequences is exported to the cytoplasm.

Here we report that transgenic Arabidopsis plants constitutively expressing the rapeseed SB1 SINE retroposon exhibit developmental defects resembling those observed in some RNAi mutants. We show that SB1 RNA interacts with HYL1 (DRB1), a double-stranded RNA-binding protein (dsRBP) that associates with the Dicer homologue DCL1 to produce microRNAs. RNase V1 protection assays mapped the binding site of HYL1 to a SB1 region that mimics the hairpin structure of microRNA precursors.

Xenopus laevis ADAR1, but not Arabidopsis DRB4, binds SB1 RNA in the same region as HYL1, suggesting that SINE RNAs bind only a subset of dsRBPs.

While the ADAR2 knockout phenotype can be attributed to the lack of editing of the GluR-B receptor, the embryonic lethal phenotype caused by ADAR1 deficiency still awaits clarification. Recently, massive editing was observed in noncoding regions of mRNAs in mice and humans. Moreover, editing was observed in protein-coding regions of four mRNAs encoding FlnA, CyFip2, Blcap, and IGFBP7. Here, we investigate which of the two active mammalian ADAR enzymes is responsible for editing of these RNAs and whether any of them could possibly contribute to the phenotype observed in ADAR knockout mice. Editing of Blcap, FlnA, and some sites within B1 and B2 SINEs clearly depends on ADAR1, while other sites depend on ADAR2.

18462451,Dyschromatosis universalis hereditaria: evidence for autosomal recessive inheritance and identification of a new locus on chromosome 12q21-q23.,"Dyschromatosis universalis hereditaria (DUH) and dyschromatosis symmetrica hereditaria (DSH) are pigmentary dermatoses most commonly seen in Japan. Both disorders usually show autosomal dominant inheritance, although in some cases autosomal recessive inheritance was reported. DSH was mapped to chromosome 1q21.3, and mutations in the gene ADAR (DSRAD) were identified in Japanese, Chinese and Taiwanese families with autosomal dominant DSH. A second locus for dyschromatosis was mapped on chromosome 6q24.2-q25.2 in two Chinese families initially reported to be affected with DSH, but later suggested to have autosomal dominant DUH. The aim of this study was to investigate whether one of these two loci is involved in the development of DUH in a consanguineous Bedouin family from Saudi Arabia with four affected and three unaffected sibs, clearly pointing to autosomal recessive inheritance. After excluding mutations in ADAR and linkage to the candidate regions on chromosomes 1 and 6, we performed an single nucleotide polymorphism-based genome-wide scan for linkage with other loci. Under the assumption of autosomal recessive inheritance, we have identified a new locus for dyschromatosis on chromosome 12q21-q23 in this Arab family with a maximum logarithm of the odds (LOD) score of 3.4, spanning a distance of 18.9 cM. Our study revealed the first locus for autosomal recessive DUH and supports recent evidence that DSH and DUH are genetically distinct disorders.",2008 Jun,Clin Genet. 2008 Jun;73(6):566-72. doi: 10.1111/j.1399-0004.2008.01000.x.

The most frequent RNA editing mechanism in mammals involves the conversion of specific adenosines into inosines by the ADAR family of enzymes. This editing event can change both the sequence and the secondary structure of RNA molecules, with important consequences on both the final proteins and regulatory RNAs.

18705826,Six novel mutations of the ADAR1 gene in patients with dyschromatosis symmetrica hereditaria: histological observation and comparison of genotypes and clinical phenotypes.,"Dyschromatosis symmetrica hereditaria (DSH), is a pigmentary genodermatosis of autosomal dominant inheritance. Since we clarified that the disease is caused by a mutation of the adenosine deaminase acting on the RNA 1 gene (ADAR1) in 2003, the molecular pathogenesis of a peculiar clinical feature of the disease has been expected to be clarified. We examined five familial cases and one sporadic case of Japanese families with DSH. The mutation analyses were done with single-strand conformation polymorphism/heteroduplex (SSCP/HD) analysis and direct sequencing of ADAR1. The DNA analysis of each patient revealed one missense mutation (p.F1091S), two nonsense mutations (p.C893X, p.S581X) and three frame-shift mutations (p.E498fsX517, p.F1091fsX1092, p.L855fsX856). Visual and electron microscopic findings showed abundant melanin pigment deposited all over the basal layer, and enlarged melanocytes with long dendrites located in the pigmented lesions with small or immature melanosomes scattered sparsely in the cytoplasm, but in the adjacent keratinocytes many small melanosomes were singly dispersed or aggregated. The hypopigmented areas showed little melanin deposition and reduced numbers of melanocytes in which much degenerative cytoplasmic vacuole formation could be observed by electron microscopy. Herein, we report six cases of DSH with six novel mutations. The variety of their clinical phenotypes even in the pedigree may suggest the presence of factors other than the ADAR1 gene influencing the extent of the clinical skin lesion. Microscopic findings suggest that the clinical appearance must have developed directly by melanocyte variations mainly induced by the ADAR1 gene mutations.",2008 Jul,J Dermatol. 2008 Jul;35(7):395-406. doi: 10.1111/j.1346-8138.2008.00493.x.,"['Kondo T', 'Suzuki T', 'Mitsuhashi Y', 'Ito S', 'Kono M', 'Komine M', 'Akita H', 'Tomita Y']",True
18515351,Inversing the natural hydrogen bonding rule to selectively amplify GC-rich ADAR-edited RNAs.,"DNA complementarity is expressed by way of three hydrogen bonds for a G:C base pair and two for A:T. As a result, careful control of the denaturation temperature of PCR allows selective amplification of AT-rich alleles. Yet for the same reason, the converse is not possible, selective amplification of GC-rich alleles. Inosine (I) hydrogen bonds to cytosine by two hydrogen bonds while diaminopurine (D) forms three hydrogen bonds with thymine. By substituting dATP by dDTP and dGTP by dITP in a PCR reaction, DNA is obtained in which the natural hydrogen bonding rule is inversed. When PCR is performed at limiting denaturation temperatures, it is possible to recover GC-rich viral genomes and inverted Alu elements embedded in cellular mRNAs resulting from editing by dsRNA dependent host cell adenosine deaminases. The editing of Alu elements in cellular mRNAs was strongly enhanced by type I interferon induction indicating a novel link mRNA metabolism and innate immunity.",2008 Jul,Nucleic Acids Res. 2008 Jul;36(12):e72. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkn295.

18180444,Genetics of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"The completion of the Human Genome Project, together with a better understanding of some of the emerging genetic patterns of human disease, has enabled a thorough examination of the most appropriate genetic models for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The pathology and epidemiology of ALS have been intensively studied since Adar, Charcot, and Duchenne first described the disease in the 1860 s. Results of genetic studies that have emerged over the past two decades have led to the identification of SOD1 as a well-established causative gene for ALS. However, the identification of SOD1 has not been followed up by the identification of other genes responsible for classic ALS. This leads to the speculation that more complex genetic mechanisms are involved than initially assumed. While mutations in single genes are still likely to constitute a small proportion of ALS cases, the genes responsible for ALS in families with clusters of two or three affected individuals, and more particularly in sporadic cases, are far from being determined. Multigenic, somatic mutation, and gene-environment models may all contribute to the genetic etiology of ALS. The challenge now lies in determining which models are the most appropriate to dissect out the genetic components involved. This research will ultimately aid in identifying the cumulative risk of developing ALS.",2008 Jan 8,Neurology. 2008 Jan 8;70(2):144-52. doi: 10.1212/01.wnl.0000296811.19811.db.,"['Valdmanis PN', 'Rouleau GA']",False

We investigated genes involved in gonad maturation of the marine scallop Argopecten purpuratus. A cDNA library was made from gonad tissue. After sequence analysis, 418 unique genes were characterized, of these, about 80% were of unknown function. Among the identified sequences, we analyzed the mRNA expression by real-time PCR of 7 genes involved in reproduction mechanisms, either directly: testis-specific serine/threonine-protein kinase (TSSK), vitellogenin (Vg), and spermatogenesis and centriole associated 1 (SCA) or indirectly: calcineurin A (CNA), centrin, RNA-specific adenosine deaminase (ADAR), and cytidine deaminase (CDA). The real-time PCR analyses were conducted on different tissues of mature and immature scallops (testis, ovary, immature gonad, gill, digestive gland and mantle).

17959665,Expression of the E3L gene of vaccinia virus in transgenic mice decreases host resistance to vaccinia virus and Leishmania major infections.,"The E3L gene of vaccinia virus (VACV) encodes the E3 protein that in cultured cells inhibits the activation of interferon (IFN)-induced proteins, double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR), 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase/RNase L (2-5A system) and adenosine deaminase (ADAR-1), thus helping the virus to evade host responses. Here, we have characterized the in vivo E3 functions in a murine inducible cell culture system (E3L-TetOFF) and in transgenic mice (TgE3L). Inducible E3 expression in cultured cells conferred on cells resistance to the antiviral action of IFN against different viruses, while expression of the E3L gene in TgE3L mice triggered enhanced sensitivity of the animals to pathogens. Virus infection monitored in TgE3L mice by different inoculation routes (intraperitoneal and tail scarification) showed that transgenic mice became more susceptible to VACV infection than control mice. TgE3L mice were also more susceptible to Leishmania major infection, leading to an increase in parasitemia compared to control mice. The enhanced sensitivity of TgE3L mice to VACV and L. major infections occurred together with alterations in the host immune system, as revealed by decreased T-cell responses to viral antigens in the spleen and lymph nodes and by differences in the levels of specific innate cell populations. These results demonstrate that expression of the E3L gene in transgenic mice partly reverses the resistance of the host to viral and parasitic infections and that these effects are associated with immune alterations.",2008 Jan,J Virol. 2008 Jan;82(1):254-67. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01384-07.

Intriguingly, we observed that the editing enzyme ADAR1 enhances reporter gene expression in a cellular, plasmid-based system. The induction of gene expression is independent of the used reporter transgene or the promoter type, but relies on the RNA editing activity and specificity of ADAR1. More detailed analysis indicates that the effect is due to enhanced reporter gene transcription. Induction of gene expression by ADAR1 is lost when the reporter expression cassette is placed in a chromosomal environment.

19008393,Dengue virus regulates type I interferon signalling in a strain-dependent manner in human cell lines.,"Outbreaks of dengue disease are constant threats to tropical and subtropical populations but range widely in severity, from mild to haemorrhagic fevers, for reasons that are still elusive. We investigated the interferon (IFN) response in infected human cell lines A549 and HepG2, using two strains (NGC and TSV01) of dengue serotype 2 (DEN2) and found that the two viruses exhibited a marked difference in inducing type I IFN response. While TSV01 infection led to activation of type I antiviral genes such as EIF2AK2 (PKR), OAS, ADAR and MX, these responses were absent in NGC-infected cells. Biochemical analysis revealed that NGC but not TSV01 suppressed STAT-1 and STAT-2 activation in response to type I IFN (alpha and beta). However, these two strains did not differ in their response to type II IFN (gamma). Although unable to suppress IFN signalling, TSV01 infection caused a weaker IFN-beta induction compared with NGC, suggesting an alternative mechanism of innate immune escape. We extended our study to clinical isolates of various serotypes and found that while MY10245 (DEN2) and MY22713 (DEN4) could suppress the IFN response in a similar fashion to NGC, three other strains of dengue [EDEN167 (DEN1), MY02569 (DEN1) and MY10340 (DEN2)] were unable to suppress the IFN response, suggesting that this difference is strain-dependent but not serotype-specific.

RNA editing of the GluR2 subunit at the Q/R site is responsible for making most AMPA receptors impermeable to calcium. Because a single-point mutation could eliminate the need for editing at the Q/R site and Q/R-unedited GluR2 exists during embryogenesis, the Q/R-unedited GluR2 subunit presumably has some important actions early in development. Using calcium imaging, we found that NPCs contain calcium-permeable AMPA receptors, whereas NPCs differentiated to neurons and astrocytes express calcium-impermeable AMPA receptors. We utilized reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and BbvI digestion to demonstrate that NPCs contain Q/R-unedited GluR2, and differentiated cells contain Q/R-edited GluR2 subunits. This is consistent with the observation that the nuclear enzyme responsible for Q/R-editing, adenosine deaminase (ADAR2), is increased during differentiation. Activation of calcium-permeable AMPA receptors induces NPCs to differentiate to the neuronal lineage and increases dendritic arbor formation in NPCs differentiated to neurons. AMPA-induced differentiation of NPCs to neurons is abrogated by overexpression of ADAR2 in NPCs. This elucidates the role of AMPA receptors as inductors of neurogenesis and provides a possible explanation for why the Q/R editing process exists.",2008 Aug,FASEB J. 2008 Aug;22(8):2888-900. doi: 10.1096/fj.07-104661.

We reported that the editing efficacy of 5-HT2CR mRNA altered during brain development in rats. The present study aimed to clarify if changes in the expression of ADAR genes and the editing of ADAR-2 pre-mRNA occur during development. The expression level of ADAR-1 mRNA was constant during development, whereas the expression levels of ADAR-2 mRNA and ADAR-2 pre-mRNA markedly increased during development. ADAR-2 pre-mRNA possesses six editing sites. Editing of these sites did not occur during the embryonic period; however, the number of edited sites and the editing frequency at these sites increased after birth and cultivation period. These results suggest that the increases in ADAR-2 pre-mRNA editing and mRNA expression of the enzyme may play a role in development.

We have overcome this obstacle and describe a method whereby the internal organs of adult Drosophila can be imaged in 3D by bleaching and clearing the adult and then imaging using a technique called optical projection tomography (OPT). The data is displayed as 2D optical sections and also in 3D to provide detail on the shape and structure of the adult anatomy. METHODOLOGY: We have used OPT to visualize in 2D and 3D the detailed internal anatomy of the intact adult Drosophila. In addition this clearing method used for OPT was tested for imaging with confocal microscopy. Using OPT we have visualized the size and shape of neurodegenerative vacuoles from within the head capsule of flies that suffer from age-related neurodegeneration due to a lack of ADAR mediated RNA-editing. In addition we have visualized tau-lacZ expression in 2D and 3D. This shows that the wholemount adult can be stained without any manipulation and that this stain penetrates well as we have mapped the localization pattern with respect to the internal anatomy. CONCLUSION: We show for the first time that the intact adult Drosophila can be imaged in 3D using OPT, also we show that this method of clearing is also suitable for confocal microscopy to image the brain from within the intact head. The major advantage of this is that organs can be represented in 3D in their natural surroundings. Furthermore optical sections are generated in each of the three planes and are not prone to the technical limitations that are associated with manual sectioning. OPT can be used to dissect mutant phenotypes and to globally map gene expression in both 2D and 3D.",2007 Sep 5,PLoS One. 2007 Sep 5;2(9):e834. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0000834.,"['McGurk L', 'Morrison H', 'Keegan LP', 'Sharpe J', ""O'Connell MA""]",True

It is well known that these enzymes can use messenger RNA as targets for A-to-I editing and thereby recode the transcript. Both ADAR1 and ADAR2 have been proven to be able to also target short double stranded RNA molecules of the same size as a microRNA. However, it is not until recently shown that A-to-I editing occurs in microRNAs and its precursors. Since the editing activity is found both in the nucleus and the cytoplasm there are several steps during the microRNA maturation pathway that can be targeted for modification.

17698644,Alternative splicing of the ADAR1 transcript in a region that functions either as a 5'-UTR or an ORF.,"The ADAR enzymes mediate the hydrolytic deamination of adenosines in specific RNA substrates and thereby diversify both the transcriptome and the proteome in metazoan species. Three promoters drive the transcription from the ADAR1 gene yielding the ADAR1-A, -B, and -C transcripts, which, in turn, lead to the production of two protein isoforms, namely, iADAR1 and cADAR1. In this study, we establish the presence of a previously unidentified alternative intron within the 5'-end of the common second exon of mRNAs encoding ADAR1 in primate species-a region that can function either as a 5'-UTR or an ORF. In addition, it is shown that the relative expression of the three promoter-specific ADAR1 transcripts is tissue specific and that the novel intron is excised from all transcripts, but at different relative levels indicating a specific regulation of the alternative splicing. Finally, possible functional consequences of the splicing are investigated. From these studies, we conclude that the alternatively spliced ADAR1-A transcript is immune to nonsense-mediated decay although it is a potential substrate. Moreover, this transcript is associated with translating ribosomes, which suggests that a truncated version of iADAR1 is expressed.",2007 Oct,RNA. 2007 Oct;13(10):1732-44. doi: 10.1261/rna.567807.

In this work, our goal is to detect gene-gene and gene-environment interactions resulting from an analysis of chronic hepatitis C patients' clinical factors including SNPs, viral genotype, viral load, age and gender. MATERIALS & METHODS: We collected blood samples from 523 chronic hepatitis C patients who had received interferon and ribavirin combination therapy. Based on the treatment strategy for chronic hepatitis C patients, we focused our search for candidate genes involved in pathways related to interferon signaling and immunomodulation. To investigate gene-gene and gene-environment interactions, we implemented an artificial neural network-based method for identifying significant interactions between clinical factors with the fivefold crossvalidation method and permutation tests. The artificial neural network model was trained by an algorithm with an adaptive momentum and learning rate. RESULTS: A total of 20 SNPs were selected from six candidate genes including adenosine deaminase-RNA-specific (ADAR), caspase 5 (CASP5), interferon consensus sequence binding protein 1 (ICSBP1), interferon-induced protein 44 (IFI44), phosphoinositide-3-kinase catalytic gamma polypeptide (PIK3CG), and transporter 2 ATP-binding cassette subfamily B (TAP2) genes. By applying our artificial neural network-based approach, IFI44 was found in the significant two-locus, three-locus and four-locus gene-gene effect models, as well as in the significant two-factor and three-factor gene-environment effect models. Furthermore, viral genotype remained in the best two-factor, three-factor and four-factor gene-environment models. These results support the hypothesis that IFI44 and viral genotype may play a role in the pharmacogenomics of interferon treatment. In addition, our approach identified a panel of ten clinical factors that may be more significant than the others for further study. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that our artificial neural network-based approach is a promising method to assess the gene-gene and gene-environment interactions for interferon and ribavirin combination treatment in chronic hepatitis C patients by using clinical factors such as SNPs, viral genotype, viral load, age and gender.",2007 Oct,Pharmacogenomics. 2007 Oct;8(10):1327-35. doi: 10.2217/14622416.8.10.1327.,"['Lin E', 'Hwang Y', 'Chen EY']",False
17908822,Altered adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing in human cancer.,"Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing was recently shown to be abundant in the human transcriptome, affecting thousands of genes. Employing a bioinformatic approach, we identified significant global hypoediting of Alu repetitive elements in brain, prostate, lung, kidney, and testis tumors. Experimental validation confirmed this finding, showing significantly reduced editing in Alu sequences within MED13 transcripts in brain tissues. Looking at editing of specific recoding and noncoding sites, including in cancer-related genes, a more complex picture emerged, with a gene-specific editing pattern in tumors vs. normal tissues. Additionally, we found reduced RNA levels of all three editing mediating enzymes, ADAR, ADARB1, and ADARB2, in brain tumors. The reduction of ADARB2 correlated with the grade of malignancy of glioblastoma multiforme, the most aggressive of brain tumors, displaying a 99% decrease in ADARB2 RNA levels. Consistently, overexpression of ADAR and ADARB1 in the U87 glioblastoma multiforme cell line resulted in decreased proliferation rate, suggesting that reduced A-to-I editing in brain tumors is involved in the pathogenesis of cancer. Altered epigenetic control was recently shown to play a central role in oncogenesis. We suggest that A-to-I RNA editing may serve as an additional epigenetic mechanism relevant to cancer development and progression.",2007 Nov,Genome Res. 2007 Nov;17(11):1586-95. doi: 10.1101/gr.6493107.

17369310,Editing modifies the GABA(A) receptor subunit alpha3.,"Adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) pre-mRNA editing by the ADAR enzyme family has the potential to increase the variety of the proteome. This editing by adenosine deamination is essential in mammals for a functional brain. To detect novel substrates for A-to-I editing we have used an experimental method to find selectively edited sites and combined it with bioinformatic techniques that find stem-loop structures suitable for editing. We present here the first verified editing candidate detected by this screening procedure. We show that Gabra-3, which codes for the alpha3 subunit of the GABA(A) receptor, is a substrate for editing by both ADAR1 and ADAR2. Editing of the Gabra-3 mRNA recodes an isoleucine to a methionine. The extent of editing is low at birth but increases with age, reaching close to 100% in the adult brain. We therefore propose that editing of the Gabra-3 mRNA is important for normal brain development.",2007 May,RNA. 2007 May;13(5):698-703. doi: 10.1261/rna.349107.

17428802,RNA binding-independent dimerization of adenosine deaminases acting on RNA and dominant negative effects of nonfunctional subunits on dimer functions.,"RNA editing that converts adenosine to inosine in double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is mediated by adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADAR). ADAR1 and ADAR2 form respective homodimers, and this association is essential for their enzymatic activities. In this investigation, we set out experiments aiming to determine whether formation of the homodimer complex is mediated by an amino acid interface made through protein-protein interactions of two monomers or via binding of the two subunits to a dsRNA substrate. Point mutations were created in the dsRNA binding domains (dsRBDs) that abolished all RNA binding, as tested for two classes of ADAR ligands, long and short dsRNA. The mutant ADAR dimer complexes were intact, as demonstrated by their ability to co-purify in a sequential affinity-tagged purification and also by their elution at the dimeric fraction position on a size fractionation column. Our results demonstrated ADAR dimerization independent of their binding to dsRNA, establishing the importance of protein-protein interactions for dimer formation. As expected, these mutant ADARs could no longer perform their catalytic function due to the loss in substrate binding. Surprisingly, a chimeric dimer consisting of one RNA binding mutant monomer and a wild type partner still abolished its ability to bind and edit its substrate, indicating that ADAR dimers require two subunits with functional dsRBDs for binding to a dsRNA substrate and then for editing activity to occur.",2007 Jun 1,J Biol Chem. 2007 Jun 1;282(22):16054-61. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M611392200.

17525170,The C-terminal domain of RNA Pol II helps ensure that editing precedes splicing of the GluR-B transcript.,"The C-terminal domain (CTD) of the large subunit of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) influences many steps in the synthesis of an mRNA and helps control the final destiny of the mature transcript. ADAR2 edits RNA by converting adenosine to inosine within double-stranded or structured RNA. Site-selective A-to-I editing often occurs at sites near exon/intron borders, where it depends on intronic sequences for substrate recognition. It is therefore essential that editing precedes splicing. We have investigated whether there is coordination between ADAR2 editing and splicing of the GluR-B pre-mRNA. We show that the CTD is required for efficient editing at the R/G site one base upstream of a 5'-splice site. The results suggest that the CTD enhances editing at the R/G site by preventing premature splicing that would remove the intronic recognition sites for ADAR2. Editing at the GluR-B Q/R site, 24 bases upstream of the intron 11 5'-splice site, stimulates splicing at this intron. Furthermore, unlike previously studied introns, the CTD actually inhibits excision of intron 11, which includes the complementary recognition sequences for the Q/R editing site. In summary, these results show that the CTD and ADAR2 function together to enforce the order of events that allows editing to precede splicing, and they furthermore suggest a new role for the CTD as a coordinator of two interdependent pre-mRNA processing events.",2007 Jul,RNA. 2007 Jul;13(7):1071-8. doi: 10.1261/rna.404407.

ADAR2 gene transcripts are substrates for the ADAR1 and ADAR2 enzymes and their expression is regulated by editing at the - 1 and - 2 sites. Our previous experiments demonstrated up-regulation of type I interferon (IFN) inducible 150 kDa ADAR1 in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) T cells. In this study we investigate the role of ADAR1 and ADAR2 in editing of ADAR2 gene transcripts of healthy controls and SLE patients. The ADAR2 gene transcripts were cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO vectors. A total of 150 clones from SLE and 150 clones from controls were sequenced. Sequence analysis demonstrated A to I editing at - 1, + 10, + 23 and + 24 in normal T cells. In SLE clones site-selective editing of the - 2 site was observed as a result of type I IFN-inducible 150 kDa ADAR1 expression. These results are confirmed by analysing ADAR2 transcripts of normal T cells activated with type I IFN-alpha. Editing of the + 23 and + 24 sites was decreased in SLE T cells compared to normal controls. In addition to A to G changes, U to C discrepancies were observed in normal and SLE T cells. In SLE cells, positions - 6 and + 30 were frequently edited from U to C compared to normal controls. Taken together, these results demonstrate altered and site-selective editing in ADAR2 transcripts of SLE patients. Based on these results, it is proposed that altered transcript editing contributes to the modulation of gene expression and immune functions in SLE patients.",2007 Jul,Immunology. 2007 Jul;121(3):359-69. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2567.2007.02582.x.

17020943,A-to-G hypermutation in the genome of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus.,"The interferon-inducible adenosine deaminase that acts on double-stranded RNA (ADAR1-L) has been proposed to be one of the antiviral effector proteins within the complex innate immune response. Here, the potential role of ADAR1-L in the innate immune response to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), a widely used virus model, was studied. Infection with LCMV clearly upregulated ADAR1-L expression and activity. The editing activity of ADAR1-L on an RNA substrate was not inhibited by LCMV replication. Accordingly, an adenosine-to-guanosine (A-to-G) and uracil-to-cytidine (U-to-C) hypermutation pattern was found in the LCMV genomic RNA in infected cell lines and in mice. In addition, two hypermutated clones with a high level of A-to-G or U-to-C mutations within a short stretch of the viral genome were isolated. Analysis of the functionality of viral glycoprotein revealed that A-to-G- and U-to-C-mutated LCMV genomes coded for nonfunctional glycoprotein at a surprisingly high frequency. Approximately half the GP clones with an amino acid mutation lacked functionality. These results suggest that ADAR1-L-induced mutations in the viral RNA lead to a loss of viral protein function and reduced viral infectivity. This study therefore provides strong support for the contribution of ADAR1-L to the innate antiviral immune response.",2007 Jan,J Virol. 2007 Jan;81(2):457-64. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00067-06.

17079286,Double-stranded RNA deaminase ADAR1 increases host susceptibility to virus infection.,"The RNA-editing enzyme ADAR1 is a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) binding protein that modifies cellular and viral RNA sequences by adenosine deamination. ADAR1 has been demonstrated to play important roles in embryonic erythropoiesis, viral response, and RNA interference. In human hepatitis virus infection, ADAR1 has been shown to target viral RNA and to suppress viral replication through dsRNA editing. It is not clear whether this antiviral effect of ADAR1 is a common mechanism in response to viral infection. Here, we report a proviral effect of ADAR1 that enhances replication of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) through a mechanism independent of dsRNA editing. We demonstrate that ADAR1 interacts with dsRNA-activated protein kinase PKR, inhibits its kinase activity, and suppresses the alpha subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF-2alpha) phosphorylation. Consistent with the inhibitory effect on PKR activation, ADAR1 increases VSV infection in PKR+/+ mouse embryonic fibroblasts; however, no significant effect was found in PKR-/- cells. This proviral effect of ADAR1 requires the N-terminal domains but does not require the deaminase domain. These findings reveal a novel mechanism of ADAR1 that increases host susceptibility to viral infection by inhibiting PKR activation.",2007 Jan,J Virol. 2007 Jan;81(2):917-23. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01527-06.

17224799,Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 accelerates cell cycle through increased translation and activity of cyclin-dependent kinase 2.,"Adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing has been recently implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammation through the upregulation of the editase adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1). Because cell proliferation is a key feature of the inflammatory process, the present study tested the hypothesis that overexpression of ADAR1 accelerates cell cycle. To that end, human embryonic kidney 293 cells were transiently transfected with ADAR1 or vector, and cell cycle was evaluated by fluorescence-activated cell sorter. Overexpression of wild-type ADAR1 decreased the proportion of G0-G1 cells (-19%, P<0.01, n=3), increased the percentage of S phase cells (+19%, P<0.01, n=3), and did not change the ratio of cells residing in the G2-M phase (n=3). This finding was supported by three observations. First, there was a parallel production in ADAR1-transfected cells of cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) 2 and cyclin A, a pivotal protein complex upregulated at the G1-S phase checkpoint, and of [p]-Histone H1, a marker of Cdk2 activity (+102%, P<0.01, n=3). Second, ADAR1-transfected cells displayed higher activity of the proliferation marker, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide. Third, using anti-ADAR1 antibody, direct binding of ADAR1 to Cdk2 messenger RNA was demonstrated in ADAR1-transfected cells by protein-RNA cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (+974%, P<0.01, n=3). Finally, causal relationships between ADAR1 and Cdk2 were confirmed by a study with the Cdk2 inhibitor, kenpaullone, which prevented the ADAR1-induced shift from the G0-G1 to the S phase. Taken together, these data show that ADAR1 increases cell cycle by shifting cells from the G0-G1 to the S phase through the upregulation of Cdk2.",2007 Feb,Shock. 2007 Feb;27(2):214-9. doi: 10.1097/01.shk.0000238072.51653.f2.,"['Zhang F', 'Rabinovici R']",True

17913828,RNA editing of the human herpesvirus 8 kaposin transcript eliminates its transforming activity and is induced during lytic replication.,"Human herpesvirus 8 is the etiologic agent associated with Kaposi's sarcoma and primary effusion lymphoma (PEL). The K12 RNA, which produces as many as three variants of the kaposin protein, as well as a microRNA, is the most abundant transcript expressed in latent Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus infection, and yet it is also induced during lytic replication. The portion of the transcript that includes the microRNA and the kaposin A sequence has been shown to have tumorigenic potential. Genome coordinate 117990, which is within this transcript, has been found to be heterogeneous, primarily in RNAs but also among viral DNA sequences. This sequence heterogeneity affects an amino acid in kaposins A and C and the microRNA. The functional effects of this sequence heterogeneity have not been studied, and its origin has not been definitively settled; both RNA editing and heterogeneity at the level of the viral genome have been proposed. Here, we show that transcripts containing A at position 117990 are tumorigenic, while those with G at this position are not. Using a highly sensitive quantitative assay, we observed that, in PEL cells under conditions where more than 60% of cDNAs derived from K12 RNA transcripts have G at coordinate 117990, there is no detectable G in the viral DNA sequence at this position, only A. This result is consistent with RNA editing by one of the host RNA adenosine deaminases (ADARs). Indeed, we observed that purified human ADAR1 efficiently edits K12 RNA in vitro. Remarkably, the amount of editing correlated with the replicative state of the virus; editing levels were nearly 10-fold higher in cells treated to induce lytic viral replication. These results suggest that RNA editing controls the function of one segment of the kaposin transcript, such that it has transforming activity during latent replication and possibly another, as-yet-undetermined, function during lytic replication.",2007 Dec,J Virol. 2007 Dec;81(24):13544-51. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01521-07.

The presence of a small proportion of activated T cells is the hallmark of SLE. Therefore, it was hypothesized that 150-kDa ADAR1 gene expression is induced by the physiological activation of T cells. To examine this hypothesis, normal T cells were activated by anti-CD3-epsilon plus anti-CD28 for various time periods from 0 to 48 hr. The expression of 110-kDa and 150-kDa ADAR1, and interleukin (IL)-2 and beta-actin gene transcripts was analysed. An approximately fourfold increase in 150-kDa ADAR1 gene expression was observed in activated T cells. ADAR2 gene transcripts are substrates for ADAR1 and ADAR2 enzymes. Therefore, we assessed the role of the 150-kDa ADAR enzyme in editing of ADAR2 gene transcripts. In activated T cells, site-selective editing of the -2 site was observed. Previous studies indicate that this site is predominantly edited by ADAR1. In addition to this, novel editing sites at base positions -56, -48, -45, -28, -19, -15, +46 and +69 were identified in activated T cells. On the basis of these results, it is proposed that 150-kDa ADAR1 gene expression is selectively induced in T cells by anti-CD3-epsilon and anti-CD28 stimulation and that it may play a role in site-selective editing of gene transcripts and in altering the functions of several gene products of T cells during activation and proliferation.",2007 Dec,Immunology. 2007 Dec;122(4):623-33. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2567.2007.02709.x.

To examine the physiologic consequences resulting from ADAR2 misexpression, we have generated mutant mice expressing either wild-type or deaminase-deficient ADAR2 transgenes under the control of the human cytomegalovirus promoter. Transgenic mice expressing either wild-type or inactive ADAR2 isoforms demonstrated adult onset obesity characterized by hyperglycemia, hyperleptinemia, and increased adiposity. Paired feeding analysis revealed that mutant mice on caloric restriction had a growth rate and body composition indistinguishable from wild-type littermates, indicating that the observed obesity predominantly results from hyperphagia rather than a metabolic derangement. The observation that expression of catalytically inactive ADAR2 also is capable of producing an obese phenotype in mutant animals suggests that ADAR2 may possess additional biological activities beyond those required for the site-selective deamination of adenosine or may interfere with the actions of other double-stranded RNA-specific binding proteins in the cell.",2007 Aug 3,J Biol Chem. 2007 Aug 3;282(31):22448-59. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M700265200.

Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADAR1-3) convert adenosine to inosine on synthetic RNAs, analogous to 5-HT2cR and GluR. The order of editing as well as mechanisms controlling editing in native neurons is unknown. (2) With single-cell RT-PCR we investigated the co-expression of ADAR genes with GluR and 5-HT2cR and determined the editing status at known sites in the hypothalamic tuberomamillary nucleus, a major center for wakefulness and arousal. (3) The most frequently expressed enzymes were ADAR1, followed by ADAR2. The Q/R site of GluR2 was always fully edited. Editing at the R/G site in the GluR2 (but not GluR4) subunit was co-ordinated with ADAR expression: maximal editing was found in neurons expressing both ADAR2 splice variants of the deaminase domain and lacking ADAR3. (4) Editing of the 5-HT2cR did not correlate with ADAR expression. The 5-HT2cR mRNA was always edited at A, in the majority of cells at B sites and variably edited at E, C and D sites. A negative correlation was found between editing of C and D sites. The GluR4 R/G site editing was homogeneous within individuals: it was fully edited in all neurons obtained from 12 rats and under-edited in six neurons obtained from three rats. (5) We conclude that GluR2 R/G editing is controlled at the level of ADAR2 and therefore this enzyme may be a target for pharmacotherapy.

This study investigated 5 families and 3 sporadic patients with dyschromatosis symmetrica hereditaria in the Chinese Han population from Anhui province, China. By direct sequencing, 5 novel ADAR gene mutations (c.982C>T, c.1491insA, c.2568_2571delTAAC, c.2969C>G and c.3040G>T) and 3 mutations described previously (c.3203-2A>G, c.3247C>T and c.3286C>T) were identified, all of which were heterozygous. We reviewed a total of 48 mutations in the ADAR gene in patients with dyschromatosis symmetrica hereditaria by previous reports and speculated that the mutation hotspots on the ADAR gene might be located in exons 9-15.

17517775,Regulation of glutamate receptor B pre-mRNA splicing by RNA editing.,"RNA-editing enzymes of the ADAR family convert adenosines to inosines in double-stranded RNA substrates. Frequently, editing sites are defined by base-pairing of the editing site with a complementary intronic region. The glutamate receptor subunit B (GluR-B) pre-mRNA harbors two such exonic editing sites termed Q/R and R/G. Data from ADAR knockout mice and in vitro editing assays suggest an intimate connection between editing and splicing of GluR-B pre-mRNA. By comparing the events at the Q/R and R/G sites, we can show that editing can both stimulate and repress splicing efficiency. The edited nucleotide, but not ADAR binding itself, is sufficient to exert this effect. The presence of an edited nucleotide at the R/G site reduces splicing efficiency of the adjacent intron facilitating alternative splicing events occurring downstream of the R/G site. Lack of editing inhibits splicing at the Q/R site. Editing of both the Q/R nucleotide and an intronic editing hotspot are required to allow efficient splicing. Inefficient intron removal may ensure that only properly edited mRNAs become spliced and exported to the cytoplasm.",2007,Nucleic Acids Res. 2007;35(11):3723-32. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkm314.

17662844,Comparative genomic and bioinformatic approaches for the identification of new adenosine-to-inosine substrates.,"Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing is the enzymatic deamination of A-to-I catalyzed by ADAR (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA). Adenosine is read by ribosomes as guanosine causing a codon change and potentially protein recoding. A-to-I RNA editing can be either promiscuous, where the editing is nonspecific, or site specific, which requires a complex target RNA secondary structure formed by intramolecular base pairings between editing sequences and intronic or exonic editing site complementary sequences (ECSs). The most numerous editing sites have been found in noncoding regions containing Alu repeats, such as 3' untranslated regions, while specific editing sites are mostly found in transcripts involved in the transmission of neuronal signals. Previously A-to-I RNA editing sites were discovered by chance, but recently investigators have used comparative genomic and bioinformatics methods to identify novel sites. In this chapter, we discuss these approaches to identifying new editing sites.",2007,Methods Enzymol. 2007;424:245-64. doi: 10.1016/S0076-6879(07)24011-X.,"['Sixsmith J', 'Reenan RA']",True
17662845,Genetic approaches to studying adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing.,"Increasing proteomic diversity via the hydrolytic deamination of adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) in select mRNA templates appears crucial to the correct functioning of the nervous system in several model organisms, including Drosophila, Caenorabditis elegans, and mice. The genome of the fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster, contains a single gene encoding the enzyme responsible for deamination, termed ADAR (for adenosine deaminase acting on RNA). The mRNAs that form the substrates for ADAR primarily function in neuronal signaling, and, correspondingly, deletion of ADAR leads to severe nervous system defects. While several ADAR enzymes are present in mice, the presence of a single ADAR in Drosophila, combined with the diverse genetic toolkit available to researchers and the wide range of ADAR target mRNAs identified to date, make Drosophila an ideal organism to study the genetic basis of A-to-I RNA editing. This chapter describes a variety of methods for genetically manipulating Drosophila A-to-I editing both in time and space, as well as techniques to study the molecular basis of ADAR-mRNA interactions. A prerequisite for experiments in this field is the ability to quantify the levels of editing in a given mRNA. Therefore, several commonly used methods for the quantification of editing levels will also be described.",2007,Methods Enzymol. 2007;424:265-87. doi: 10.1016/S0076-6879(07)24012-1.,"['Jepson JE', 'Reenan RA']",True
17662847,Purification and assay of ADAR activity.,"ADAR editing enzymes are found in all multicellular animals and are conserved in sequence and protein organization. The number of ADAR genes differs between animals, ranging from three in mammals to one in Drosophila. ADAR is also alternatively spliced to generate isoforms that can differ significantly in enzymatic activity. Therefore, to study the enzyme in vitro, it is essential to have an easy and reliable method of expressing and purifying recombinant ADAR protein. To add to the complexity of RNA editing, the number of transcripts that are edited by ADARs differs in different organisms. In humans there is extensive editing of Alu sequences, whereas in invertebrates transcripts expressed in the central nervous system are edited and this editing increases during development. It is possible to quantify site-specific RNA editing by sequencing of clones derived from RT-PCR products. However, for routine assaying of an edited position within a particular transcript, this is both expensive and time consuming. Therefore, a nonradioactive method based on poison primer extension assay is an ideal alternative.",2007,Methods Enzymol. 2007;424:301-17. doi: 10.1016/S0076-6879(07)24014-5.,"['Keegan LP', 'Rosenthal JJ', 'Roberson LM', ""O'Connell MA""]",True
17662848,Large-scale overexpression and purification of ADARs from Saccharomyces cerevisiae for biophysical and biochemical studies.,"Many biochemical and biophysical analyses of enzymes require quantities of protein that are difficult to obtain from expression in an endogenous system. To further complicate matters, native adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADARs) are expressed at very low levels, and overexpression of active protein has been unsuccessful in common bacterial systems. Here we describe the plasmid construction, expression, and purification procedures for ADARs overexpressed in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. ADAR expression is controlled by the Gal promoter, which allows for rapid induction of transcription when the yeast are grown in media containing galactose. The ADAR is translated with an N-terminal histidine tag that is cleaved by the tobacco etch virus protease, generating one nonnative glycine residue at the N-terminus of the ADAR protein. ADARs expressed using this system can be purified to homogeneity, are highly active in deaminating RNA, and are produced in quantities (from 3 to 10mg of pure protein per liter of yeast culture) that are sufficient for most biophysical studies.",2007,Methods Enzymol. 2007;424:319-31. doi: 10.1016/S0076-6879(07)24015-7.,"['Macbeth MR', 'Bass BL']",True

While significant advances have been made regarding the functional consequences of A-to-I editing using heterologous expression systems, the physiological relevance of such RNA modifications in mammals has been addressed effectively using gene-targeting strategies in mice via homologous recombination in embryonic stem (ES) cells. These gene-targeting approaches have allowed the generation of mutant mouse strains in which site-specific editing events can be fixed in the fully edited or nonedited state for individual ADAR targets, expression of ADAR proteins can be selectively ablated, or a combination of ADAR elimination and ADAR target modification can be used for a more in-depth understanding of the biological consequences of A-to-I editing dysregulation.",2007,Methods Enzymol. 2007;424:333-67. doi: 10.1016/S0076-6879(07)24016-9.,"['Rula EY', 'Emeson RB']",True

Since inosine is decoded as guanosine, this reaction can lead to codon changes and the introduction of amino acids into a gene product not encoded in the gene. Translation of the different coding strands created by this process leads to protein structural diversity in the parent organism and is necessary for nervous system function in metazoa. The basis for selective editing of adenosines within certain codons is not well understood at the structural/biochemical level. Here we describe the use of synthetic nucleoside analogs incorporated into RNA editing substrates via the protected phosphoramidites to define aspects of the editing reaction mechanism and to carry out mechanism-based trapping of ADAR-RNA complexes. In addition, a high-throughput screen has been developed capable of rapidly identifying functional editing systems.",2007,Nucleic Acids Symp Ser (Oxf). 2007;(51):83-4. doi: 10.1093/nass/nrm042.,"['Beal PA', 'Maydanovych O', 'Pokharel S']",True

16884961,Computational analyses show A-to-G mutations correlate with nascent mRNA hairpins at somatic hypermutation hotspots.,"Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) initiates Phase I somatic hypermutation (SHM) of antibody genes by deaminating deoxy-cytosine to deoxy-uracil (C-to-U). These lesions trigger Phase II, a poorly understood process of error-prone repair targeting A-T pairs by DNA polymerase eta (Pol eta). Since Pol eta is also a reverse transcriptase, Phase II could involve copying off RNA as well as DNA templates. We explore this idea further since in an RNA-based pathway it is conceivable that adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing causes A-to-G transitions since I like G pairs with C. Adenosine deaminases (ADARs) are known to preferentially edit A nucleotides that are preceded by an A or U (W) in double-stranded RNA substrates. On this assumption and using a theoretical bioinformatics approach we show that a significant and specific correlation (P<0.002) exists between the frequency of WA-to-WG mutations and the number of mRNA hairpins that could potentially form at the mutation site. This implies roles for both RNA editing and reverse transcription during SHM in vivo and suggests definitive genetic experiments targeting the appropriate ADAR1 isoform (gammaINF-ADAR1) and/or Ig pre-mRNA templates.",2006 Nov 8,DNA Repair (Amst). 2006 Nov 8;5(11):1346-63. doi: 10.1016/j.dnarep.2006.06.002.

16956888,RNA editing by ADAR2 is metabolically regulated in pancreatic islets and beta-cells.,"RNA editing via the conversion of adenosine (A) to inosine (I) is catalyzed by two major families of adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs), ADAR1 and ADAR2. This genetic recoding process is known to play essential roles in the brain, due in part to changes in functional activities of edited neurotransmitter receptors and ion channels. Little is known, however, about the physiological regulation and function of A to I RNA editing in peripheral tissues and other biological processes. Here, we report that both ADAR1 and ADAR2 are expressed in the murine pancreatic islets, and ADAR2 is primarily localized in the islet endocrine cells. In contrast to ADAR1, ADAR2 transcripts in the pancreatic islets exhibit a nearly 2-fold increase in insulin-resistant mice chronically fed a high fat diet. Concurrent with this diet-induced metabolic stress, RNA editing in the islets is dramatically enhanced for the RNA transcripts encoding the ionotropic glutamate receptor subunit B. Moreover, ADAR2 protein expression is repressed in the islets under fuel deficiency condition during fasting, and this repression can be completely reversed by refeeding. We also show that, specifically in pancreatic beta-cell lines, not only the expression of ADAR2 but also the glutamate receptor subunit B editing and ADAR2 self-editing are markedly augmented in response to glucose at the physiological concentration for insulin secretion stimulation. Thus, RNA editing by ADAR2 in pancreatic islets and beta-cells is metabolically regulated by nutritional and energy status, suggesting that A to I RNA editing is most likely involved in the modulation of pancreatic islet and beta-cell function.",2006 Nov 3,J Biol Chem. 2006 Nov 3;281(44):33386-94. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M604484200.

17105647,The conserved protein kinase-A target motif in synapsin of Drosophila is effectively modified by pre-mRNA editing.,"BACKGROUND: Synapsins are abundant synaptic vesicle associated phosphoproteins that are involved in the fine regulation of neurotransmitter release. The Drosophila member of this protein family contains three conserved domains (A, C, and E) and is expressed in most or all synaptic terminals. Similar to mouse mutants, synapsin knock-out flies show no obvious structural defects but are disturbed in complex behaviour, notably learning and memory. RESULTS: We demonstrate that the N-terminal phosphorylation consensus motif RRxS that is conserved in all synapsins investigated so far, is modified in Drosophila by pre-mRNA editing. In mammals this motif represents the target site P1 of protein kinase A (PKA) and calcium/calmodulin dependent protein kinase I/IV. The result of this editing, by which RRFS is modified to RGFS, can be observed in cDNAs of larvae and adults and in both isolated heads and bodies. It is also seen in several newly collected wild-type strains and thus does not represent an adaptation to laboratory culture conditions. A likely editing site complementary sequence is found in a downstream intron indicating that the synapsin pre-mRNA can form a double-stranded RNA structure that is required for editing by the adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) enzyme. A deletion in the Drosophila Adar gene generated by transposon remobilization prevents this modification, proving that the ADAR enzyme is responsible for the pre-mRNA editing described here. We also provide evidence for a likely function of synapsin editing in Drosophila. The N-terminal synapsin undeca-peptide containing the genomic motif (RRFS) represents an excellent substrate for in-vitro phosphorylation by bovine PKA while the edited peptide (RGFS) is not significantly phosphorylated. Thus pre-mRNA editing by ADAR could modulate the function of ubiquitously expressed synapsin in a cell-specific manner during development and adulthood. CONCLUSION: Similar to several other neuronal proteins of Drosophila, synapsin is modified by ADAR-mediated recoding at the pre-mRNA level. This editing likely reduces or abolishes synapsin phosphorylation by PKA. Since synapsin in Drosophila is required for various forms of behavioural plasticity, it will be fascinating to investigate the effect of this recoding on learning and memory.",2006 Nov 14,BMC Neurosci. 2006 Nov 14;7:76. doi: 10.1186/1471-2202-7-76.,"['Diegelmann S', 'Nieratschker V', 'Werner U', 'Hoppe J', 'Zars T', 'Buchner E']",False

Structural analysis has demonstrated the lack of base-specific interactions of dsRBDs with either a perfect RNA duplex or an RNA hairpin. We therefore asked whether in vitro selections performed in parallel with individual dsRBDs could yield RNAs that are specifically recognized by the dsRBD on which they were selected . To this end, SELEX experiments were performed using either the second dsRBD of the RNA-editing enzyme ADAR1 or the second dsRBD of Xlrbpa, a homolog of TRBP that is involved in RISC formation. Several RNA families with high binding capacities for dsRBDs were isolated from either SELEX experiment, but no discrimination of these RNAs by different dsRBDs could be detected. The selected RNAs are highly structured, and binding regions map to two neighboring stem-loops that presumably form stacked helices and are interrupted by mismatches and bulges. Despite the lack of selective binding of SELEX RNAs to individual dsRBDS, selected RNAs can efficiently interfere with RNA editing in vivo.",2006 Nov,RNA. 2006 Nov;12(11):1993-2004. doi: 10.1261/rna.125506.

Here, we show that forebrain ischemia in adult rats selectively reduces expression of ADAR2 enzyme and, hence, disrupts RNA Q/R site editing of GluR2 subunit in vulnerable neurons. Recovery of GluR2 Q/R site editing by expression of exogenous ADAR2b gene or a constitutively active CREB, VP16-CREB, which induces expression of endogenous ADAR2, protects vulnerable neurons in the rat hippocampus from forebrain ischemic insult. Generation of a stable ADAR2 gene silencing by delivering small interfering RNA (siRNA) inhibits GluR2 Q/R site editing, leading to degeneration of ischemia-insensitive neurons. Direct introduction of the Q/R site edited GluR2 gene, GluR2(R607), rescues ADAR2 degeneration.

We investigated the role of the CTD of RNA pol II in the coordination of A to I editing and splicing of the ADAR2 (ADAR: adenosine deaminases that act on RNA) pre-mRNA. The auto-editing of Adar2 intron 4 by the ADAR2 adenosine deaminase is tightly coupled to splicing, as the modification of the dinucleotide AA to AI creates a new 3' splice site. Unlike other introns, the CTD is not required for efficient splicing of intron 4 at either the normal 3' splice site or the alternative site created by editing. However, the CTD is required for efficient co-transcriptional auto-editing of ADAR2 intron 4.

16475990,The large form of ADAR 1 is responsible for enhanced hepatitis delta virus RNA editing in interferon-alpha-stimulated host cells.,"Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) RNA editing controls the formation of hepatitis-delta-antigen-S and -L and therefore indirectly regulates HDV replication. Editing is thought to be catalysed by the adenosine deaminase acting on RNA1 (ADAR1) of which two different forms exist, interferon (IFN)-alpha-inducible ADAR1-L and constitutively expressed ADAR1-S. ADAR1-L is hypothesized to be a part of the innate cellular immune system, responsible for deaminating adenosines in viral dsRNAs. We examined the influence of both forms on HDV RNA editing in IFN-alpha-stimulated and unstimulated hepatoma cells. For gene silencing, an antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotide against a common sequence of both forms of ADAR1 and another one specific for ADAR1-L alone were used. IFN-alpha treatment of host cells led to approximately twofold increase of RNA editing compared with unstimulated controls. If ADAR1-L expression was inhibited, this substantial increase in editing could no longer be observed. In unstimulated cells, ADAR1-L suppression had only minor effects on editing. Inhibition of both forms of ADAR1 simultaneously led to a substantial decrease of edited RNA independently of IFN-alpha-stimulation. In conclusion, the two forms of ADAR1 are responsible almost alone for HDV editing. In unstimulated cells, ADAR1-S is the main editing activity. The increase of edited RNA under IFN-alpha-stimulation is because of induction of ADAR1-L, showing for the first time that this IFN-inducible protein is involved in the base modification of replicating HDV RNA. Thus, induction of ADAR1-L may at least partially cause the antiviral effect of IFN-alpha in natural immune response to HDV as well as in case of therapeutic administration of IFN.",2006 Mar,J Viral Hepat. 2006 Mar;13(3):150-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2893.2005.00663.x.,"['Hartwig D', 'Schütte C', 'Warnecke J', 'Dorn I', 'Hennig H', 'Kirchner H', 'Schlenke P']",False

ADAR2 contains two tandem double-stranded RNA-binding motifs (dsRBMs) that are not only important for efficient editing of RNA substrates but also necessary for localizing ADAR2 to nucleoli. The sequence and structural similarity of these motifs have raised questions regarding the role(s) that each dsRBM plays in ADAR2 function. Here, we demonstrate that the dsRBMs of ADAR2 differ in both their ability to modulate subnuclear localization as well as to promote site-selective A-to-I conversion. Surprisingly, dsRBM1 contributes to editing activity in a substrate-dependent manner, indicating that dsRBMs recognize distinct structural determinants in each RNA substrate. Although dsRBM2 is essential for the editing of all substrates examined, a point mutation in this motif affects editing for only a subset of RNAs, suggesting that dsRBM2 uses unique sets of amino acid(s) for functional interactions with different RNA targets. The dsRBMs of ADAR2 are interchangeable for subnuclear targeting, yet such motif alterations do not support site-selective editing, indicating that the unique binding preferences of each dsRBM differentially contribute to their pleiotropic function.",2006 Jul,Mol Biol Cell. 2006 Jul;17(7):3211-20. doi: 10.1091/mbc.e06-02-0162.

By both in vitro and in vivo assays, we show that the DRBMs of rat ADAR2 are necessary and sufficient for dimerization of the enzyme.

The ADAR2 DRBMs thus serve differential roles in RNA dimerization and GluR2 Q/R editing, and we propose a model for RNA editing that incorporates the new findings.",2006 Jul,RNA. 2006 Jul;12(7):1350-60. doi: 10.1261/rna.2314406.

It achieves an overall sustained response rate of approximately 50%; however, the treatment takes 6-12 months and often brings significant adverse reactions to some patients. It would therefore be beneficial to include a pretreatment evaluation in order to maximize the efficacy. In addition to viral genotypes, we hypothesize that patient genotypes might also be useful for the prediction of treatment response. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the genetic differences of CHC patients that are associated with IFN/ribavirin responses. The DNA polymorphisms among 195 sustained responders and 122 nonresponders of CHC patients of Taiwanese origin were compared. Statistical and algorithmic methods were used to select the genes associated with drug response and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that permitted the construction of a predictive model. RESULTS: Association studies and haplotype reconstruction revealed selection of seven genes: adenosine deaminase, RNA-specific (ADAR), caspase 5, apoptosis-related cysteine peptidase (CASP5), fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1), interferon consensus sequence binding protein 1 (ICSBP1), interferon-induced protein 44 (IFI44), transporter 2, ATP-binding cassette, subfamily B (TAP2) and transforming growth factor, beta receptor associated protein 1 (TGFBRAP1) for the responsiveness trait. Based on confirmed linkage disequilibrium block in the population, a minimal set of 26 SNPs in the seven selected genes was inferred. To predict treatment outcome, a multiple logistic regression model was constructed using susceptible genotypes of SNPs. The performance of the resultant model had a sensitivity of 68.2% and specificity of 60.7% on 317 CHC patients treated with IFN-combined therapy. In addition, a prediction model with both the host genetic and viral genotype information was also constructed which enhanced the performance with a sensitivity of 80.7% and specificity of 67.2%. CONCLUSIONS: A genetic model was constructed to predict outcomes of the combination therapy in CHC patients with high sensitivity and specificity. Results also provide a possible process of selecting targets for predicting treatment outcomes and the basis for developing pharmacogenetic tests.",2006 Jul,Pharmacogenomics. 2006 Jul;7(5):697-709. doi: 10.2217/14622416.7.5.697.,"['Hwang Y', 'Chen EY', 'Gu ZJ', 'Chuang WL', 'Yu ML', 'Lai MY', 'Chao YC', 'Lee CM', 'Wang JH', 'Dai CY', 'Shian-Jy Bey M', 'Liao YT', 'Chen PJ', 'Chen DS']",False
16382140,Altered RNA editing in mice lacking ADAR2 autoregulation.,"ADAR2 is a double-stranded-RNA-specific adenosine deaminase involved in the editing of mammalian RNAs by the site-selective conversion of adenosine to inosine. Previous studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that ADAR2 can modify its own pre-mRNA to create a proximal 3' splice site containing a noncanonical adenosine-inosine dinucleotide. Alternative splicing to this proximal acceptor adds 47 nucleotides to the mature ADAR2 transcript, thereby resulting in the loss of functional ADAR2 protein expression due to premature translation termination in an alternate reading frame. To examine whether the editing of ADAR2 transcripts represents a negative autoregulatory strategy to modulate ADAR2 protein expression, we have generated genetically modified mice in which the ability of ADAR2 to edit its own pre-mRNA has been selectively ablated by deletion of a critical sequence (editing site complementary sequence [ECS]) required for adenosine-to-inosine conversion. Here we demonstrate that ADAR2 autoediting and subsequent alternative splicing are abolished in homozygous deltaECS mice and that ADAR2 protein expression is increased in numerous tissues compared to wild-type animals. The observed increases in ADAR2 protein expression correlate with the extent of ADAR2 autoediting observed with wild-type tissues and correspond to increases in the editing of ADAR2 substrates, indicating that ADAR2 autoediting is a key regulator of ADAR2 protein expression and activity in vivo.",2006 Jan,Mol Cell Biol. 2006 Jan;26(2):480-8. doi: 10.1128/MCB.26.2.480-488.2006.,"['Feng Y', 'Sansam CL', 'Singh M', 'Emeson RB']",True

Although this editing recodes and alters functions of several mammalian genes, its most common targets are noncoding repeat sequences, indicating the involvement of this editing system in currently unknown functions other than recoding of protein sequences. Here we show that specific adenosine residues of certain microRNA (miRNA) precursors are edited by ADAR1 and ADAR2. Editing of pri-miR-142, the precursor of miRNA-142, expressed in hematopoietic tissues, resulted in suppression of its processing by Drosha. The edited pri-miR-142 was degraded by Tudor-SN, a component of RISC and also a ribonuclease specific to inosine-containing dsRNAs. Consequently, mature miRNA-142 expression levels increased substantially in ADAR1 null or ADAR2 null mice.

17156436,p150 ADAR1 isoform involved in maintenance of HeLa cell proliferation.,"BACKGROUND: RNA-specific adenosine deaminase ADAR1 is ubiquitously expressed in a variety of mammalian cells and tissues. Although its physiological importance in non-nervous tissues has been confirmed by analysis of null mutation phenotypes, few endogenous editing substrates have been identified in numerous peripheral tissues and biological function of ADAR1 has not been fully understood. METHODS: A conditional site-specific, ribozyme-based gene knock-down strategy was utilized to study the function of full-length isoform of ADAR1 (p150 protein) in HeLa cell. Double-stable HeLa cell lines were developed by transfecting HeLa Tet-On cells with a pTRE-derived plasmid that can express a hammerhead ribozyme against mRNA of p150 ADAR1 isoform under induction condition. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting were performed to measure the expression of p150 in selected cell clones. Cell proliferation was evaluated by means of MTT assay and growth curve analysis. Cellular morphological changes were observed under light microscope. Flow Cytometry was used for cell cycle analysis. Growth rate of cell transplants in BALB/c nude mice was also investigated. RESULTS: Both HeLa cell proliferation in vitro and the growth rate of transplanted HeLa cell-derived tumors in nude mice in vivo were significantly inhibited due to reduced expression of ADAR1 p150. Additionally, cell cycle analysis showed that cell progression from G1 phase to S phase was retarded in the ADAR1 p150 suppressed cells. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that normal expression and functioning of p150 ADAR1 is essential for the maintenance of proper cell growth. The mechanisms underlying ADAR1's action might include both editing of currently unknown double-stranded RNAs and interacting with other cellular dsRNA-related processes.",2006 Dec 8,BMC Cancer. 2006 Dec 8;6:282. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-6-282.,"['Wang H', 'Hou Z', 'Wu Y', 'Ma X', 'Luo X']",True
17055994,Methods for enrichment of a mRNA isoform with specific alternative splicing.,"Alternative splicing of pre-mRNA is an important mechanism for regulating gene expression in higher eukaryotes. Recent genomewide analyses of alternative splicing indicate that 40-60% of human genes have alternative splice isoforms, although some variants exist only in relatively low abundance. It has been shown that proteins of different functions can be produced by a diverse array of mRNA derived from a single pre-mRNA. Inevitably cloning and expression of the corresponding mRNAs (cDNA) constitute an essential step toward elucidating the function of such protein isoforms. Here, we propose methods for enriching an mRNA isoform, which is carried out before the RNA preparation is subjected to reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and cloning. While the negative selection method destroys unwanted mRNA variants, the positive selection enriches the desired variant. Focusing on the mRNA of rat ADAR2 (adenosine deaminase 2 that acts on RNA) as an example, we have achieved 16- and 19-fold enrichment of the given mRNA variant via the proposed negative and positive selection, respectively. Single use or combined uses of our method facilitates the isolation and cloning of a minor mRNA variant. Moreover, these methods can also be used to determine whether two alternative splicing events taking place in a pre-mRNA are linked.",2006 Dec 15,Anal Biochem. 2006 Dec 15;359(2):189-93. doi: 10.1016/j.ab.2006.09.014.

Because inosine is decoded as guanosine, this reaction can lead to codon changes and the introduction of amino acids into a gene product not encoded in the gene. Translation of the different coding strands created by this process leads to protein structural diversity in the parent organism and is necessary for nervous system function in metazoa. The basis for selective editing of adenosines within certain codons is not well understood at the structural/biochemical level. Here we describe a high-throughput screen for ADAR/substrate combinations capable of RNA editing that can be carried out in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae growing on agar plates.

A-->I RNA editing was long thought to affect only selected transcripts by altering the proteins they encode. However, genome-wide screening has revealed numerous editing sites within inverted Alu repeats in introns and untranslated regions. Also, recent evidence indicates that A-->I RNA editing crosstalks with RNA-interference pathways, which, like A-->I RNA editing, involve dsRNAs.

16790843,The role of a metastable RNA secondary structure in hepatitis delta virus genotype III RNA editing.,"RNA editing plays a critical role in the life cycle of hepatitis delta virus (HDV). The host editing enzyme ADAR1 recognizes specific RNA secondary structure features around the amber/W site in the HDV antigenome and deaminates the amber/W adenosine. A previous report suggested that a branched secondary structure is necessary for editing in HDV genotype III. This branched structure, which is distinct from the characteristic unbranched rod structure required for HDV replication, was only partially characterized, and knowledge concerning its formation and stability was limited. Here, we examine the secondary structures, conformational dynamics, and amber/W site editing of HDV genotype III RNA using a miniaturized HDV genotype III RNA in vitro. Computational analysis of this RNA using the MPGAfold algorithm indicated that the RNA has a tendency to form both metastable and stable unbranched secondary structures. Moreover, native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrated that this RNA forms both branched and unbranched rod structures when transcribed in vitro. As predicted, the branched structure is a metastable structure that converts readily to the unbranched rod structure. Only branched RNA was edited at the amber/W site by ADAR1 in vitro. The structural heterogeneity of HDV genotype III RNA is significant because not only are both conformations of the RNA functionally important for viral replication, but the ratio of the two forms could modulate editing by determining the amount of substrate RNA available for modification.",2006 Aug,RNA. 2006 Aug;12(8):1521-33. doi: 10.1261/rna.89306.

16536805,Two novel mutations and evidence for haploinsufficiency of the ADAR gene in dyschromatosis symmetrica hereditaria.,"BACKGROUND: Dyschromatosis symmetrica hereditaria (DSH, MIM 127400) is a dominantly inherited skin disease associated with mutations in ADAR, the gene that encodes a double-stranded RNA-specific adenosine deaminase. We previously reported two novel ADAR mutations (p.Q513X and p.R916W) and confirmed the role of ADAR in Chinese patients with DSH. Both haploinsufficiency and a dominant-negative effect have been suggested as the potential mechanism by which ADAR mutations cause DSH. OBJECTIVES: To identify ADAR mutations in two additional Chinese DSH families and to obtain insight into the pathogenic mechanism of heterozygous ADAR mutations. METHODS: For mutation detection, all ADAR exons and their flanking intronic sequences were amplified and sequenced. Mutations were further confirmed by restriction analysis. Direct sequencing of cDNA fragments produced by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and real-time quantitative RT-PCR were used to examine the expression of ADAR in peripheral lymphocytes isolated from affected individuals. RESULTS: A small deletion, c.1555delT (p.C519fs), and a missense mutation, c.3116A>G (p.K1039R), were found in families A and B, respectively. In individuals carrying p.Q513X or p.C519fs, sequencing of cDNA fragments indicated almost total loss of mRNA expression from the mutant alleles, and real-time quantitative RT-PCR showed an approximately 50% reduction of ADAR expression. However, equal abundance of the wild-type and mutant cDNA sequences without reduction of ADAR expression was found in a patient with the missense p.R916W mutation. These results suggest that both the nonsense p.Q513X and frameshift p.C519fs mutations have generated null alleles probably by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. CONCLUSIONS: Two novel ADAR mutations were found in Chinese patients with DSH.

16903221,RNA editing in hepatitis delta virus.,"Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) relies heavily on host functions and on structural features of the viral RNA. A good example of this reliance is found in the process known as HDV RNA editing, which requires particular structural features in the HDV antigenome, and a host RNA editing enzyme, ADAR1. During replication, the adenosine at the amber/W site in the HDV antigenome is edited to inosine. As a result, the amber stop codon in the hepatitis delta antigen (HDAg) open reading frame is changed to a tryptophan codon and the reading frame is extended by 19 or 20 codons. Because these extra amino acids alter the functional properties of HDAg, this change serves a critical purpose in the HDV replication cycle. Analysis of the RNA secondary structures and regulation of editing in HDV genotypes I and III has indicated that although editing is essential for both genotypes, there are substantial differences. This review covers the mechanisms of RNA editing in the HDV replication cycle and the regulatory mechanisms by which HDV controls editing.",2006,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol. 2006;307:67-89. doi: 10.1007/3-540-29802-9_4.,['Casey JL'],True

It has been clear that the RNAi effect triggered by endogenous or exogenous siRNAs (small interfering RNAs) is transient and dose-dependent. However, there is little information on the regulation of RNAi. Recently, some proteins that regulate the RNA-silencing machinery have been identified. We have observed in previous work that the expression of target genes rebounds after being suppressed for a period of time by siRNAs. In the present study, we used secretory hepatitis B virus surface antigen gene as a reporter and compared its expression level in cell culture and mice challenged by different doses of siRNAs. A quicker and higher rebound of gene expression was observed in mice tail-vein-injected with higher doses of siRNA, and the rebound was associated with an increase in the mRNA level of meri-1 (mouse enhanced RNAi) and adar-1 (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA) genes encoding an exonuclease and RNA-specific adenosine deaminase respectively. Down-regulation of meri-1 by RNAi enhanced the sensitivity and efficiency of siRNA in inhibiting the expression of hepatitis B virus surface antigen.

16103170,"Effects of conserved RNA secondary structures on hepatitis delta virus genotype I RNA editing, replication, and virus production.","RNA editing of the hepatitis delta virus (HDV) antigenome at the amber/W site by the host RNA adenosine deaminase ADAR1 is a critical step in the HDV replication cycle. Editing is required for production of the viral protein hepatitis delta antigen long form (HDAg-L), which is necessary for viral particle production but can inhibit HDV RNA replication. The RNA secondary structural features in ADAR1 substrates are not completely defined, but base pairing in the 20-nucleotide (nt) region 3' of editing sites is thought to be important. The 25-nt region 3' of the HDV amber/W site in HDV genotype I RNA consists of a conserved secondary structure that is mostly base paired but also has asymmetric internal loops and single-base bulges. To understand the effect of this 3' region on the HDV replication cycle, mutations that either increase or decrease base pairing in this region were created and the effects of these changes on amber/W site editing, RNA replication, and virus production were studied. Increased base pairing, particularly in the region 15 to 25 nt 3' of the editing site, significantly increased editing; disruption of base pairing in this region had little effect. Increased editing resulted in a dramatic inhibition of HDV RNA synthesis, mostly due to excess HDAg-L production. Although virus production at early times was unaffected by this reduced RNA replication, at later times it was significantly reduced. Therefore, it appears that the conserved RNA secondary structure around the HDV genotype I amber/W site has been selected not for the highest editing efficiency but for optimal viral replication and secretion.",2005 Sep,J Virol. 2005 Sep;79(17):11187-93. doi: 10.1128/JVI.79.17.11187-11193.2005.,"['Jayan GC', 'Casey JL']",True

Our results further show that human ADAR1 is modified by SUMO-1 on lysine residue 418. An arginine substitution of K418 abolishes SUMO-1 conjugation and although it does not interfere with ADAR1 proper localization, it stimulates the ability of the enzyme to edit RNA both in vivo and in vitro.

RNAi has been found as a widespread natural phenomenon in eukaryotic cells and is also being used as a powerful experimental tool to explore gene function. Most importantly, it has many potential therapeutic applications. Viral gene-specific siRNAs are theoretically very promising antiviral inhibitors and have been examined in a broad range of medically important viruses. However, many RNA viruses escape RNAi-mediated suppression by counteracting the RNAi machinery through mutation of the targeted region, by encoding viral suppressors, or both. DNA viruses also counteract the RNAi machinery, preferentially using viral suppressors. Cellular factors may also contribute to RNAi resistance; ADAR1 was the first cellular factor found to be responsible for editing-mediated RNAi resistance. Because siRNAs can be used as potent small-molecule inhibitors of any cellular gene, the best way for a cell to maintain expression of essential genes for its long-term survival is to develop a program to resist the detrimental effects of RNAi.",2005 Nov,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2005 Nov;1058:105-18. doi: 10.1196/annals.1359.019.,"['Zheng ZM', 'Tang S', 'Tao M']",False

RESULTS: The EVR rate was 67.7% in blacks and 63.6% in whites. Both blacks and whites experienced a significant (200%-500%) increase in 2,5-OAS, MxA, PKR, and ADAR1 expression at treatment weeks 4-12 compared with baseline (P < .01). However, the relationship between IFN-stimulated gene expression and the EVR differed by race. White responders exhibited higher 2,5-OAS and MxA levels at week 4 than white nonresponders (P < .05). IFN-stimulated gene levels did not correlate with EVR in blacks. Black responders had much lower MxA and PKR levels at week 4 than black nonresponders (P < .05). However, black responders maintained increased 2,5-OAS, MxA, and PKR levels from weeks 4-12, whereas the levels decreased to baseline at weeks 8-12 in black nonresponders.

15858013,New antiviral pathway that mediates hepatitis C virus replicon interferon sensitivity through ADAR1.,"While many clinical hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections are resistant to alpha interferon (IFN-alpha) therapy, subgenomic in vitro self-replicating HCV RNAs (HCV replicons) are characterized by marked IFN-alpha sensitivity. IFN-alpha treatment of replicon-containing cells results in a rapid loss of viral RNA via translation inhibition through double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR) and also through a new pathway involving RNA editing by an adenosine deaminase that acts on double-stranded RNA (ADAR1). More than 200 genes are induced by IFN-alpha, and yet only a few are attributed with an antiviral role. We show that inhibition of both PKR and ADAR1 by the addition of adenovirus-associated RNA stimulates replicon expression and reduces the amount of inosine recovered from RNA in replicon cells. Small inhibitory RNA, specific for ADAR1, stimulated the replicon 40-fold, indicating that ADAR1 has a role in limiting replication of the viral RNA. This is the first report of ADAR's involvement in a potent antiviral pathway and its action to specifically eliminate HCV RNA through adenosine to inosine editing. These results may explain successful HCV replicon clearance by IFN-alpha in vitro and may provide a promising new therapeutic strategy for HCV as well as other viral infections.",2005 May,J Virol. 2005 May;79(10):6291-8. doi: 10.1128/JVI.79.10.6291-6298.2005.,"['Taylor DR', 'Puig M', 'Darnell ME', 'Mihalik K', 'Feinstone SM']",False
15939761,ADAR2-mediated editing of RNA substrates in the nucleolus is inhibited by C/D small nucleolar RNAs.,"Posttranscriptional, site-specific adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) base conversions, designated as RNA editing, play significant roles in generating diversity of gene expression. However, little is known about how and in which cellular compartments RNA editing is controlled. Interestingly, the two enzymes that catalyze RNA editing, adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADAR) 1 and 2, have recently been demonstrated to dynamically associate with the nucleolus. Moreover, we have identified a brain-specific small RNA, termed MBII-52, which was predicted to function as a nucleolar C/D RNA, thereby targeting an A-to-I editing site (C-site) within the 5-HT2C serotonin receptor pre-mRNA for 2'-O-methylation. Through the subcellular targeting of minigenes that contain natural editing sites, we show that ADAR2- but not ADAR1-mediated RNA editing occurs in the nucleolus. We also demonstrate that MBII-52 forms a bona fide small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein particle that specifically decreases the efficiency of RNA editing by ADAR2 at the targeted C-site. Our data are consistent with a model in which C/D small nucleolar RNA might play a role in the regulation of RNA editing.",2005 Jun 6,J Cell Biol. 2005 Jun 6;169(5):745-53. doi: 10.1083/jcb.200411129.,"['Vitali P', 'Basyuk E', 'Le Meur E', 'Bertrand E', 'Muscatelli F', 'Cavaillé J', 'Huttenhofer A']",False
15920480,Tuning of RNA editing by ADAR is required in Drosophila.,"RNA editing increases during development in more than 20 transcripts encoding proteins involved in rapid synaptic neurotransmission in Drosophila central nervous system and muscle. Adar (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA) mutant flies expressing only genome-encoded, unedited isoforms of ion-channel subunits are viable but show severe locomotion defects. The Adar transcript itself is edited in adult wild-type flies to generate an isoform with a serine to glycine substitution close to the ADAR active site. We show that editing restricts ADAR function since the edited isoform of ADAR is less active in vitro and in vivo than the genome-encoded, unedited isoform. Ubiquitous expression in embryos and larvae of an Adar transcript that is resistant to editing is lethal. Expression of this transcript in embryonic muscle is also lethal, with above-normal, adult-like levels of editing at sites in a transcript encoding a muscle voltage-gated calcium channel.",2005 Jun 15,EMBO J. 2005 Jun 15;24(12):2183-93. doi: 10.1038/sj.emboj.7600691.

We have clarified for the first time four pathological mutations of the double-stranded RNA-specific adenosine deaminase gene (ADAR1 or DSRAD) in four DSH pedigrees. In this paper, we report 16 novel mutations containing six missense substitutions (p.V906F, p.K1003R, p.G1007R, p.C1036S, p.S1064F, p.R1078C), two splice site mutations (IVS2+2T>G, IVS8+2T>A), six frameshift mutations (p.H216fs, p.K433fs, p.G507fs, p.P727fs, p.V955fs, p.K1201fs), and two nonsense mutations (p.R426X, p.Q600X) found in Japanese patients with DSH. We did not establish any clear correlation between the clinical phenotypes and the genotypes of ADAR1 gene mutations in our examination of 16 cases plus four pedigrees. None of the different mutations identified in our studies of 20 cases suggested any founder effect. Furthermore, we did not identify any mutations in the ADAR1 gene of three patients with dyschromatosis universalis hereditaria or three patients with acropigmentatio reticularis, indicating that the two diseases are completely different from DSH, although they have sometimes been suggested to be phenotypical variations of DSH.",2005 Jun,J Invest Dermatol. 2005 Jun;124(6):1186-92. doi: 10.1111/j.0022-202X.2005.23732.x.,"['Suzuki N', 'Suzuki T', 'Inagaki K', 'Ito S', 'Kono M', 'Fukai K', 'Takama H', 'Sato K', 'Ishikawa O', 'Abe M', 'Shimizu H', 'Kawai M', 'Horikawa T', 'Yoshida K', 'Matsumoto K', 'Terui T', 'Tsujioka K', 'Tomita Y']",True
15895094,The RISC subunit Tudor-SN binds to hyper-edited double-stranded RNA and promotes its cleavage.,"Long perfect double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules play a role in various cellular pathways. dsRNA may undergo extensive covalent modification (hyper-editing) by adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADARs), resulting in conversion of up to 50% of adenosine residues to inosine (I). Alternatively, dsRNA may trigger RNA interference (RNAi), resulting in silencing of the cognate mRNA. These two pathways have previously been shown to be antagonistic. We show a novel interaction between components of the ADAR and RNAi pathways. Tudor staphylococcal nuclease (Tudor-SN) is a subunit of the RNA-induced silencing complex, which is central to the mechanism of RNAi. Here we show that Tudor-SN specifically interacts with and promotes cleavage of model hyper-edited dsRNA substrates containing multiple I.U and U.I pairs.

15843431,Chromosomal storage of the RNA-editing enzyme ADAR1 in Xenopus oocytes.,"ADARs (adenosine deaminases that act on RNA) are RNA-editing enzymes that convert adenosines to inosines in structured or double-stranded RNAs. Expression and intracellular distribution of ADAR1 is controlled by a plethora of mechanisms suggesting that enzyme activity has to be tightly regulated. Mammalian ADAR1 is a shuttling protein, whereas Xenopus ADAR1 is exclusively nuclear. In oocytes, Xenopus ADAR1 associates with most nascent transcripts but is strongly enriched at a specific site on chromosome 3, termed the special loop. Enrichment at this site requires the presence of RNAs but is independent of ongoing transcription. Here we show that RNAs transcribed elsewhere in the genome accumulate at the special loop even in the absence of transcription. In situ hybridization experiments, however, indicate the absence of known editing substrates from this site. In the absence of transcription also other RNA binding and processing factors accumulate at the special loop, suggesting that ADAR1 is stored or assembled at the special loop in an RNA-containing complex. Nuclear injection of RNAs providing binding sites for ADAR1 dissociates the enzyme from the special loop, supporting the notion that the special loop represents a site where ADAR1 is stored, possibly for later use during development.",2005 Jul,Mol Biol Cell. 2005 Jul;16(7):3377-86. doi: 10.1091/mbc.e05-01-0016.

15522950,Identification of new targets of Drosophila pre-mRNA adenosine deaminase.,"Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) in Drosophila and mammals has recently become the target of numerous investigations. It is now clear that this protein has a number of functions in the nervous system. Indeed, the mutation of ADAR in Drosophila (dADAR) results in many pathological and physiological changes, such as sensitivity to hypoxia and neuronal degeneration. To understand the full scope of dADAR function, it is crucial to identify new dADAR targets. A polyclonal antibody against inosine was developed and used to enrich inosine-containing mRNAs. The efficiency of immunoaffinity purification was confirmed for the Q/R editing site of GluR-B pre-mRNA that has been edited by ADAR2 to generate inosines at the editing site. This approach was applied to enrich inosine-containing mRNAs from total mRNAs of wild-type and dADAR mutant flies, respectively. The enriched mRNA portion was then amplified and hybridized with Drosophila cDNA arrays. With this method, over 500 mRNAs were identified as potential dADAR targets by showing a higher amount in the enriched mRNA portion from wild-type flies than from dADAR mutant flies. The occurrence of A-to-G conversion in these mRNAs was further analyzed by comparing over 7,000 Drosophila cDNAs sequences with their genomic sequences. A final list of 62 candidates was generated from the overlap of the two approaches. Twelve genes from the final list were further examined by sequencing the RT-PCR products of these genes from wild-type and dADAR mutant flies. Seven of the 12 genes were proven to have A-to-G changes in the wild-type but not in mutant flies. We conclude that the combination of immunoaffinity enrichment of inosine-containing mRNA, DNA microarrays, and sequence comparison could facilitate the discovery of new dADAR substrates, which in turn allows us to better understand the targets of dADAR and the biological function of A-to-I RNA editing in flies.",2005 Jan 20,Physiol Genomics. 2005 Jan 20;20(2):195-202. doi: 10.1152/physiolgenomics.00093.2003.

15556947,ADAR1 RNA deaminase limits short interfering RNA efficacy in mammalian cells.,"Double-stranded RNA induces the homology-dependent degradation of cognate mRNA in the cytoplasm via RNA interference (RNAi) but also is a target for adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing by adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs). An interaction between the RNAi and the RNA editing pathways in Caenorhabditis elegans has been suggested recently, but the precise mode of interaction remains to be established. In addition, it is unclear whether this interaction is possible in mammalian cells with their somewhat different RNAi pathways. Here we show that ADAR1 and ADAR2, but not ADAR3, avidly bind short interfering RNA (siRNA) without RNA editing. In particular, the cytoplasmic full-length isoform of ADAR1 has the highest affinity among known ADARs, with a subnanomolar dissociation constant. Gene silencing by siRNA is significantly more effective in mouse fibroblasts homozygous for an ADAR1 null mutation than in wild-type cells. In addition, suppression of RNAi effects are detected in fibroblast cells overexpressing functional ADAR1 but not when overexpressing mutant ADAR1 lacking double-stranded RNA-binding domains. These results identify ADAR1 as a cellular factor that limits the efficacy of siRNA in mammalian cells.",2005 Feb 4,J Biol Chem. 2005 Feb 4;280(5):3946-53. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M407876200.

15723802,Vigilins bind to promiscuously A-to-I-edited RNAs and are involved in the formation of heterochromatin.,"The fate of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) in the cell depends on both its length and location . The expression of dsRNA in the nucleus leads to several distinct consequences. First, the promiscuous deamination of adenosines to inosines by dsRNA-specific adenosine deaminase (ADAR) can lead to the nuclear retention of edited transcripts . Second, dsRNAs might induce heterochromatic gene silencing through an RNAi-related mechanism . Is RNA editing also connected to heterochromatin? We report that members of the conserved Vigilin class of proteins have a high affinity for inosine-containing RNAs. In agreement with other work , we find that these proteins localize to heterochromatin and that mutation or depletion of the Drosophila Vigilin, DDP1, leads to altered nuclear morphology and defects in heterochromatin and chromosome segregation. Furthermore, nuclear Vigilin is found in complexes containing not only the editing enzyme ADAR1 but also RNA helicase A and Ku86/70. In the presence of RNA, the Vigilin complex recruits the DNA-PKcs enzyme, which appears to phosphorylate a discrete set of targets, some or all of which are known to participate in chromatin silencing. These results are consistent with a mechanistic link between components of the DNA-repair machinery and RNA-mediated gene silencing.",2005 Feb 22,Curr Biol. 2005 Feb 22;15(4):384-91. doi: 10.1016/j.cub.2005.01.046.,"['Wang Q', 'Zhang Z', 'Blackwell K', 'Carmichael GG']",True
15659550,A PKR-like eukaryotic initiation factor 2alpha kinase from zebrafish contains Z-DNA binding domains instead of dsRNA binding domains.,"The double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-dependent protein kinase (PKR) is induced as part of the IFN response in mammals and acts to shut down protein synthesis by the phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2alpha (eIF2alpha). In fish, a PKR-like kinase activity has been detected, but the enzyme responsible has eluded characterization. Here, we describe a PKR-like kinase from zebrafish. Phylogenetic analysis shows that the C-terminal kinase domain is more closely related to the kinase domain of PKR than to any of the other three known eIF2alpha kinases. Surprisingly, instead of the two dsRNA binding domains found at the N terminus of PKR, there are two Zalpha domains. Zalpha domains specifically bind dsDNA and RNA in the left-handed Z conformation, often with high affinity. They have been found previously in two other IFN-inducible proteins, the dsRNA editing enzyme, ADAR1, and Z-DNA binding protein 1 (ZBP1), as well as in the poxvirus virulence factor, E3L. This previously undescribed kinase, designated PKZ (protein kinase containing Z-DNA binding domains), is transcribed constitutively at low levels and is highly induced after injection of poly(inosinic)-poly(cytidylic) acid, which simulates viral infection. Binding of Z-DNA by the Zalpha domain of PKZ was demonstrated by circular dichroism. PKZ inhibits translation in transfected cells; site-directed mutagenesis indicates that this inhibition depends on its catalytic activity. Identification of a gene combining Zalpha domains with a PKR-like kinase domain strengthens the hypothesis that the ability to bind left-handed nucleic acid plays a role in the host response to viruses.",2005 Feb 1,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2005 Feb 1;102(5):1602-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0408714102.

15624111,Deficient RNA editing of GluR2 and neuronal death in amyotropic lateral sclerosis.,"One plausible hypothesis for selective neuronal death in sporadic amyotropic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is excitotoxicity mediated by alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) receptors, which are a subtype of ionotropic glutamate receptors. The Ca2+ conductance of AMPA receptors differs markedly depending on whether the GluR2 (or GluR-B) subunit is a component of the receptor. The properties of GluR2 are generated posttranscriptionally by RNA editing at the Q/R site in the putative second membrane domain (M2), during which the glutamine (Q) codon is substituted by an arginine (R) codon. AMPA receptors containing the unedited form of GluR2Q have high Ca2+ permeability in contrast to the low Ca2+ conductance of those containing the edited form of GluR2R. The role of Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptors, particularly GluR2 Q/R site RNA editing status, in neuronal death has been clearly demonstrated both in mice deficient in editing at the GluR2 Q/R site and in mice transgenic for an artificial Ca(2+)-permeable GluR2 subunit. We analyzed the expression level of mRNA of each AMPA receptor subunit in individual motor neurons, as well as the editing efficiency of GluR2 mRNA at the Q/R site in the single neuron level in control subjects and ALS cases. There was no significant difference as to the expression profile of AMPA receptor subunits or the proportion of GluR2 mRNA to total GluRs mRNA between normal subjects and ALS cases. By contrast, the editing efficiency varied greatly, from 0% to 100%, among the motor neurons of each individual with ALS, and was not complete in 44 of them (56%), whereas it remained 100% in normal controls. In addition, GluR2 editing efficiency was more than 99% in the cerebellar Purkinje cells of ALS, spinocerebellar degeneration and normal control groups. Thus, GluR2 underediting occurs in a disease specific and region selective manner. GluR2 modification by RNA editing is a biologically crucial event for neuronal survival, and its deficiency is a direct cause of neuronal death. Therefore, marked reduction of RNA editing in ALS motor neurons may be a direct cause of the selective motor neuron death seen in ALS. It is likely that the molecular mechanism underlying the deficiency in RNA editing is a reduction in the activity of ADAR2, a double- strand RNA specific deaminase. The restoration of this enzyme activity in ALS motor neurons may open the novel strategy for specific ALS therapy.",2005 Feb,J Mol Med (Berl). 2005 Feb;83(2):110-20. doi: 10.1007/s00109-004-0599-z.

One splices out the whole of exon 2, which encodes two double-stranded RNA-binding domains (dsRBDs), resulting in a frameshift that introduces a stop codon in the downstream exon. This variant accounts for between 13% and 20% of the total ADAR2 mRNA in each developmental stage and brain region examined, even though its translated product is not expressed at levels that are detectable by Western blot analysis. The other new splice site is located in exon 9, 83 nucleotides downstream of the stop codon for the long C-terminus, resulting in a new 3' untranslated region (UTR) that is about 80 bp longer than the previously reported short C-terminus. The variant produced by this splice site has a stop codon at the same site as that in ADAR2 mRNA containing canonical exons 9 and 10, and is predicted to be translated as an enzymatically active ADAR2 protein. With these two additional splice sites, a total of 48 mRNA variants are theoretically possible, because each splicing event occurs independently. Among them, variants containing the long C-terminus are translated in human brains in situ, implying that alternative splicing in the 3' UTR of ADAR2 might regulate translational efficiency and mRNA stability in vivo.",2005 Dec 19,Gene. 2005 Dec 19;363:193-201. doi: 10.1016/j.gene.2005.07.028.

ADAR1 was recently demonstrated to function in host defense and in embryonic erythropoiesis during fetal liver development. The mechanisms for these phenotypic effects are not yet known. Here we report a novel function of ADAR1 in the regulation of gene expression by interacting with the nuclear factor 90 (NF90) proteins, known regulators that bind the antigen response recognition element (ARRE-2) and have been demonstrated to stimulate transcription and translation. ADAR1 upregulates NF90-mediated gene expression by interacting with the NF90 proteins, including NF110, NF90, and NF45. A knockdown of NF90 with small interfering RNA suppresses this function of ADAR1. Coimmunoprecipitation and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) digestion demonstrate that ADAR1 is associated with NF110, NF90, and NF45 through the bridge of cellular dsRNA. Studies with ADAR1 deletions demonstrate that the dsRNA binding domain and a region covering the Z-DNA binding domain and the nuclear export signal comprise the complete function of ADAR1 in upregulating NF90-mediated gene expression.

Since editing of 5-HT2CR mRNA is regulated by adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs), it is of interest to investigate if the expression of these enzymes changes during cell differentiation. The level of ADAR1 mRNA in NG108-15 cells was decreased by cell differentiation.

15677478,Expression of interferon-inducible RNA adenosine deaminase ADAR1 during pathogen infection and mouse embryo development involves tissue-selective promoter utilization and alternative splicing.,"ADAR1 (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA) is widely expressed in adult mammals and has a critical role during embryogenesis. Two size forms of ADAR1 are known that possess adenosine-to-inosine editing activity: an interferon (IFN)-inducible approximately 150-kDa protein and a constitutively expressed N-terminally truncated approximately 110-kDa protein. We defined the structure of the 5'-flanking region of the mouse Adar1 gene, and we show here that mouse Adar1 transcripts possess alternative exon 1 structures (1A, 1B, and 1C) that initiate from unique promoters and are spliced to a common exon 2 junction. Exon 1A-containing transcripts encoding p150 were expressed in all tissues examined from adult mice (brain, cecum, heart, kidney, liver, lung, spleen, and Peyer's patches) and were elevated most significantly in liver but remained lowest in brain following oral infection with Salmonella. Exon 1B-containing RNA was most abundant in brain and was not increased in any tissue examined following infection. Exon 1C-containing RNA was very scarce. Exon 1A, but not exon 1B or 1C, expression was increased in fibroblast L cells treated with IFN, and a consensus ISRE element was present in the promoter driving exon 1A expression. Exon 1B, but not 1A, was detectable in embryonic day 10.5 embryos and was abundantly expressed in embryonic day 15 embryos. Furthermore, the ADAR1 p110 protein isoform was detected in embryonic tissue, whereas both p110 and the inducible p150 proteins were found in IFN-treated L cells. Finally, the presence of alternative exon 7a correlated with exon 1B-containing RNA, and alternative exon 7b correlated with exon 1A-containing RNA. These results establish that multiple promoters drive the expression of the Adar1 gene in adult mice, that the IFN inducible promoter and exon 1A-containing RNA are primarily responsible for the increased ADAR1 observed in Salmonella-infected mice, and that the constitutive exon 1B-containing transcript and encoded p110 protein product are abundantly expressed both in adult brain and during embryogenesis.",2005 Apr 15,J Biol Chem. 2005 Apr 15;280(15):15020-8. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M500476200.

16177183,Modulation of ADAR1 editing activity by Z-RNA in vitro.,"RNA editing by A-to-I modification has been recognized as an important molecular mechanism for generating RNA and protein diversity. In mammals, it is mediated by a family of adenosine deaminases that act on RNAs (ADARs). The large version of the editing enzyme ADAR1 (ADAR1-L), expressed from an interferon-responsible promoter, has a Z-DNA/Z-RNA binding domain at its N-terminus. We have tested the in vitro ability of the enzyme to act on a 50 bp segment of dsRNA with or without a Z-RNA forming nucleotide sequence. A-to-I editing efficiency is markedly enhanced in presence of the sequence favoring Z-RNA. In addition, an alteration in the pattern of modification along the RNA duplex becomes evident as reaction times decrease. These results suggest that the local conformation of dsRNA molecules might be an important feature for target selectivity by ADAR1 and other proteins with Z-RNA binding domains.",2005,Nucleic Acids Res. 2005 Sep 21;33(16):5362-70. doi: 10.1093/nar/gki849.

16254076,Cleavage of dsRNAs hyper-edited by ADARs occurs at preferred editing sites.,"Long double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) may undergo covalent modification (hyper-editing) by adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADARs), whereby up to 50-60% of adenosine residues are converted to inosine. Previously, we have described a ribonuclease activity in various cell extracts that specifically targets dsRNAs hyper-edited by ADARs. Such a ribonuclease may play an important role in viral defense, or may alternatively be involved in down-regulation of other RNA duplexes. Cleavage of hyper-edited dsRNA occurs within sequences containing multiple IU pairs but not in duplexes that contain either isosteric GU pairs or Watson-Crick base pairs. Here, we describe experiments aimed at further characterizing cleavage of hyper-edited dsRNA. Using various inosine-containing dsRNAs we show that cleavage occurs preferentially at a site containing both IU and UI pairs, and that inclusion of even a single GU pair inhibits cleavage. We also show that cleavage occurs on both strands within a single dsRNA molecule and requires a 2'-OH group. Strikingly, we show that ADAR1, ADAR2 or dADAR all preferentially generate the preferred cleavage site when hyper-editing a long dsRNA.",2005,Nucleic Acids Res. 2005 Oct 27;33(18):5954-64. doi: 10.1093/nar/gki909.

15731336,Evolutionarily conserved human targets of adenosine to inosine RNA editing.,"A-to-I RNA editing by ADARs is a post-transcriptional mechanism for expanding the proteomic repertoire. Genetic recoding by editing was so far observed for only a few mammalian RNAs that are predominantly expressed in nervous tissues. However, as these editing targets fail to explain the broad and severe phenotypes of ADAR1 knockout mice, additional targets for editing by ADARs were always expected. Using comparative genomics and expressed sequence analysis, we identified and experimentally verified four additional candidate human substrates for ADAR-mediated editing: FLNA, BLCAP, CYFIP2 and IGFBP7. Additionally, editing of three of these substrates was verified in the mouse while two of them were validated in chicken. Interestingly, none of these substrates encodes a receptor protein but two of them are strongly expressed in the CNS and seem important for proper nervous system function. The editing pattern observed suggests that some of the affected proteins might have altered physiological properties leaving the possibility that they can be related to the phenotypes of ADAR1 knockout mice.",2005,Nucleic Acids Res. 2005 Feb 24;33(4):1162-8. doi: 10.1093/nar/gki239.

15355102,A transition state analogue for an RNA-editing reaction.,"Deamination at C6 of adenosine in RNA catalyzed by the ADAR enzymes generates inosine at the corresponding position. Because inosine is decoded as guanosine during translation, this modification can lead to codon changes in messenger RNA. Hydration of 8-azanebularine across the C6-N1 double bond generates an excellent mimic of the transition state proposed for the hydrolytic deamination reaction catalyzed by ADARs. Here, we report the synthesis of a phosphoramidite of 8-azanebularine and its use in the preparation of RNAs mimicking the secondary structure found at a known editing site in the glutamate receptor B subunit pre-mRNA. The binding properties of analogue-containing RNAs indicate that a tight binding ligand for an ADAR can be generated by incorporation of 8-azanebularine. The observed high-affinity binding is dependent on a functional active site, the presence of one, but not the other, of ADAR2's two double-stranded RNA-binding motifs (dsRBMs), and the correct placement of the nucleoside analogue into the sequence/structural context of a known editing site. These results advance our understanding of substrate recognition during ADAR-catalyzed RNA editing and are important for structural studies of ADAR.RNA complexes.",2004 Sep 15,J Am Chem Soc. 2004 Sep 15;126(36):11213-9. doi: 10.1021/ja0472073.,"['Haudenschild BL', 'Maydanovych O', 'Véliz EA', 'Macbeth MR', 'Bass BL', 'Beal PA']",True
15380184,The binding selectivity of ADAR2's dsRBMs contributes to RNA-editing selectivity.,"ADAR2 is an RNA editing enzyme that deaminates adenosines in certain duplex structures. Here, we describe the role of its RNA binding domain, consisting of two copies of a common dsRNA binding motif (dsRBM), in editing site selectivity. ADAR2's dsRBMs bind selectively on a duplex RNA that mimics the Q/R editing site in the glutamate receptor B-subunit pre-mRNA. This selectivity is different from that of PKR's dsRBM I, indicating that dsRBMs from different proteins possess intrinsic binding selectivity. Using directed hydroxyl radical cleavage data, molecular models were developed that predict important recognition surfaces on the RNA for identified dsRBM binding sites. Blocking these surfaces by benzyl modification of guanosine 2-amino groups impeded RNA-editing, demonstrating a correlation between deamination efficiency by ADAR2 and selective binding by its dsRBMs. In addition, the editing activity of a mutant of ADAR2 lacking dsRBM I on N(2)-benzylguanosine-modified RNA suggests the location of the dsRBM I binding site that leads to editing at the GluR-B Q/R site.",2004 Sep,Chem Biol. 2004 Sep;11(9):1239-50. doi: 10.1016/j.chembiol.2004.06.009.,"['Stephens OM', 'Haudenschild BL', 'Beal PA']",True

Human ADAR2 (hADAR2) contains two double-stranded RNA binding motifs (dsRBMs), separated by a 90-amino acid linker, and these are followed by the C-terminal catalytic domain. We assayed enzymatic activity of N-terminal deletion constructs of hADAR2 to determine the role of the dsRBMs and the intervening linker peptide. We found that a truncated protein consisting of one dsRBM and the deaminase domain was capable of deaminating a short 15-bp substrate. In contrast, full-length hADAR2 was inactive on this short substrate. In addition, we observed that the N terminus, which was deleted from the truncated protein, inhibits editing activity when added in trans. We propose that the N-terminal domain of hADAR2 contains sequences that cause auto-inhibition of the enzyme. Our results suggest activation requires binding to an RNA substrate long enough to accommodate interactions with both dsRBMs.",2004 Oct,RNA. 2004 Oct;10(10):1563-71. doi: 10.1261/rna.7920904.,"['Macbeth MR', 'Lingam AT', 'Bass BL']",True
15464249,Interferon-alpha stimulation of liver cells enhances hepatitis delta virus RNA editing in early infection.,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: RNA editing controls the formation of hepatitis-delta-antigen-S and -L and therefore plays a central role in the hepatitis-delta-virus (HDV) life-cycle. Editing is catalyzed by the enzyme Adenosine-deaminase-acting-on-RNA1 (ADAR1) of which two different forms, ADAR1-L and ADAR1-S, exist. As ADAR1-L is induced by interferon (IFN)-alpha, we examined the influence of IFN-alpha-stimulation of host cells on HDV-RNA editing. METHODS: Editing was studied in Huh-7-cells transfected with HDV-RNA on days 7, 14, 21 and 28 after transfection. ADAR1-L mRNA was measured by RT-PCR. RESULTS: IFN-alpha-treatment led to a 5-fold higher expression of ADAR1-L and to an increase in editing from 14+/-2% (SD) in unstimulated controls to 27+/-4% (SD) on day 7 after transfection. Editing further increases over time to the same maximum level of 35% in IFN-alpha-treated as well as untreated cells. CONCLUSIONS: By IFN-alpha-stimulation both ADAR1-L expression and editing are increased in Huh-7-cells at day 7, and the maximum level of edited antigenomes is reached earlier with IFN-alpha-treatment as compared to untreated cells. Thus, ADAR1-L appears to be able to increase editing, but the HDV genome apparently has an intrinsic negative feed-back regulation mechanism that limits editing to roughly a third of the genomes.",2004 Oct,J Hepatol. 2004 Oct;41(4):667-72. doi: 10.1016/j.jhep.2004.06.025.,"['Hartwig D', 'Schoeneich L', 'Greeve J', 'Schütte C', 'Dorn I', 'Kirchner H', 'Hennig H']",False

Mutational analysis shows that this region adopts a hairpin structure. Electrophysiological characterization reveals that the editing event (I/V) profoundly affects channel inactivation conferred by accessory beta subunits. Drosophila melanogaster Shaker channels, mimicking this editing event through mutation, exhibit a similar effect. In addition, we demonstrate that mRNAs for the paralogous D. melanogaster Shab potassium channel are edited at the same position by fly ADAR-a clear example of convergent evolution driven by adenosine deamination.

15530657,Regulatory role of dADAR in ROS metabolism in Drosophila CNS.,"Pre-mRNA adenosine deaminase (ADAR) is involved in many physiological processes by either directly converting adenosine to inosine in certain pre-mRNAs or indirectly regulating expression of certain genes. Mutations of Drosophila ADAR (dADAR) results in neuronal dysfunction and hypersensitivity to oxygen deprivation. Recently, we found that the mutant flies were very resistant to paraquat, a compound that generates free radicals. In order to further characterize the neuronal role of dADAR and understand the basis for the resistance to the oxidative stress, we investigated the effect of dADAR on the expression of genes encoding scavengers of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in both dADAR mutant and overexpression flies. Our data show that the expression of the genes encoding known ROS scavengers [superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase] is not regulated by dADAR. However, the transcripts of genes encoding two potential ROS scavengers (dhd and Cyp4g1) were robustly increased in dADAR mutant flies, and conversely both were significantly decreased in dADAR overexpressing flies. Using dhd [encoding a Drosophila homolog of the mammalian protein thioredoxin (Trx)] transgenic flies, we confirmed that the resistance of dADAR mutant flies to paraquat resulted, at least partially, from the up-regulation of dhd gene in dADAR mutant flies. Our data not only confirm the importance of ADAR in maintenance of neuronal function but also reveal its regulatory role in the expression of genes encoding ROS scavengers.",2004 Nov 24,Brain Res Mol Brain Res. 2004 Nov 24;131(1-2):93-100. doi: 10.1016/j.molbrainres.2004.08.013.,"['Chen L', 'Rio DC', 'Haddad GG', 'Ma E']",True
14711814,Subcellular distribution of ADAR1 isoforms is synergistically determined by three nuclear discrimination signals and a regulatory motif.,"ADAR1 is an RNA-specific adenosine deaminase that edits RNA sequences. We have demonstrated previously that different ADAR1 isoforms are induced during acute inflammation. Here we show that the mouse ADAR1 isoforms are differentially localized in cellular compartments and that their localization is controlled by several independent signals. Nuclear import of the full-length ADAR1 is predominantly regulated by a nuclear localization signal at the C terminus (NLS-c), which consists of a bipartite basic amino acid motif plus the last 39 residues of ADAR1. Deletion of the NLS-c causes the truncated ADAR1 protein to be retained in the cytoplasm. The addition of this sequence to pyruvate kinase causes the cytoplasmic protein to be localized within the nucleus. The localization of nuclear ADAR1 is determined by a dynamic balance between the nucleolar binding activity of the nucleolar localization signal (NoLS) in the middle of the protein and the exporting activity of the nuclear exporter signal (NES) near the N terminus. The NoLS consists of a typical monopartite cluster of basic residues followed by the third double-stranded RNA-binding domain. These signals act independently; however, NES function can be completely silenced by the NLS-c when a regulatory motif within the catalytic domain and the NoLS are deleted. Thus, the intracellular distribution of the various ADAR1 isoforms is determined by NLS-c, NES, NoLS, and a regulatory motif.",2004 Mar 26,J Biol Chem. 2004 Mar 26;279(13):13249-55. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M312753200.

Kobiler, A. Shafferman, and B. Velan, Infect. Immun. 69:2888-2893, 2001), no data are available on the contribution of the immunological memory for PA itself to protection. We therefore developed a guinea pig model in which a primary immunization with threshold levels of PA can induce a long-term T-cell immunological memory response without inducing detectable anti-PA antibodies. A revaccination of primed animals with the same threshold PA levels was effective for memory activation, yielding a robust and rapid secondary response. A challenge with a lethal dose (40 50% lethal doses; 2,000 spores) of spores after the booster vaccinations indicated that animals were not protected at days 2, 4, and 6 postboosting. Protection was achieved only from the 8th day postboosting, concomitant with the detection of protective levels of neutralizing antibody titers in the circulation. The practical implications from the studies reported herein are that, as expected, the protective capacity of memory depends on the PA dose used for the primary immunization and that the effectiveness of booster immunizations for the postexposure treatment of anthrax may be very limited when no detectable antibodies are present in primed animals prior to Bacillus anthracis spore exposure. Therefore, to allow for the establishment of memory-dependent protection prior to the expected onset of disease, booster immunizations should not be used without concomitant antimicrobial treatment in postexposure scenarios.",2004 Jun,Infect Immun. 2004 Jun;72(6):3471-7. doi: 10.1128/IAI.72.6.3471-3477.2004.,"['Marcus H', 'Danieli R', 'Epstein E', 'Velan B', 'Shafferman A', 'Reuveny S']",False

Remarkably, homozygosity for two different null alleles of ADAR1 caused a consistent embryonic phenotype appearing early at embryonic day 11 and leading to death between embryonic days 11.5 and 12.5. This phenotype manifests a rapidly disintegrating liver structure, along with severe defects in definitive hematopoiesis, encompassing both erythroid and myeloid/granuloid progenitors as well as spleen colony-forming activity from the aorta-gonad-mesonephros region and fetal liver. Probably as a consequence of these developmental impairments, ADAR1-deficient embryonic stem cells failed to contribute to liver, bone marrow, spleen, thymus, and blood in adult chimeric mice.

14660658,Structure and sequence determinants required for the RNA editing of ADAR2 substrates.,"ADAR2 is a double-stranded RNA-specific adenosine deaminase involved in the editing of mammalian RNAs by the site-specific conversion of adenosine to inosine. We have demonstrated previously that ADAR2 can modify its own pre-mRNA, leading to the creation of a proximal 3'-splice junction containing a non-canonical adenosine-inosine (A-I) dinucleotide. Alternative splicing to this proximal acceptor shifts the reading frame of the mature mRNA transcript, resulting in the loss of functional ADAR2 expression. Both evolutionary sequence conservation and mutational analysis support the existence of an extended RNA duplex within the ADAR2 pre-mRNA formed by base-pairing interactions between regions approximately 1.3-kilobases apart in intron 4 and exon 5. Characterization of ADAR2 pre-mRNA transcripts isolated from adult rat brain identified 16 editing sites within this duplex region, and sites preferentially modified by ADAR1 and ADAR2 have been defined using both tissue culture and in vitro editing systems. Statistical analysis of nucleotide sequences surrounding edited and non-edited adenosine residues have identified a nucleotide sequence bias correlating with ADAR2 site preference and editing efficiency. Among a mixed population of ADAR substrates, ADAR2 preferentially favors its own transcript, yet mutation of a poor substrate to conform to the defined nucleotide bias increases the ability of that substrate to be modified by ADAR2.

Both the C-terminal region, consisting of a double-stranded RNA-binding motif, and the N-terminal region (vZ(E3L)), which is similar to the Zalpha family of Z-DNA-binding proteins, are required for infection. It has recently been demonstrated that the function of the N-terminal domain depends on its ability to bind Z-DNA; Z-DNA-binding domains from unrelated mammalian proteins fully complement an N-terminal deletion of E3L. Mutations that decrease affinity for Z-DNA have similar effects in decreasing pathogenicity. Compounds that block the Z-DNA-binding activity of E3L may also limit infection by the poxvirus.

15571931,Decreased DAP12 expression in natural killer lymphocytes from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus is associated with increased transcript mutations.,"Decreased numbers of natural killer (NK) cells and impaired NK function have been reported in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Since DAP12 plays a pivotal role in activation of NK cells, we analyzed the expressions of DAP12 protein and mRNA in peripheral blood NK cells from patients with SLE. Both DAP12 protein and mRNA expressions in NK cells from the SLE patients were decreased compared with those in NK cells from normal subjects. Sequence analysis of DAP12 cDNA showed increased nucleotide mutations, including both nucleotide substitutions and deletions. In spite of the mRNA mutations, we found no mutations in genomic DNA, suggesting that mRNA was modified during or after transcription. Decreased expression of DAP12 in NK cells from the patients was accompanied by increased expression of ADAR1 (adenosine deaminase that acts on RNA transcripts) and by decreased expression of NKp44. These results suggest that abnormal expression of DAP12 molecules in NK cells may account for the impairment of NK cell function in patients with SLE.",2004 Dec,J Autoimmun. 2004 Dec;23(4):371-8. doi: 10.1016/j.jaut.2004.09.003.,"['Toyabe S', 'Kaneko U', 'Uchiyama M']",False

Editing by ADARs is believed to occur in all metazoa, and is essential for mammalian development. Currently, only a limited number of human ADAR substrates are known, whereas indirect evidence suggests a substantial fraction of all pre-mRNAs being affected. Here we describe a computational search for ADAR editing sites in the human transcriptome, using millions of available expressed sequences. We mapped 12,723 A-to-I editing sites in 1,637 different genes, with an estimated accuracy of 95%, raising the number of known editing sites by two orders of magnitude. We experimentally validated our method by verifying the occurrence of editing in 26 novel substrates. A-to-I editing in humans primarily occurs in noncoding regions of the RNA, typically in Alu repeats.

15093687,Altered RNA editing of serotonin 5-HT2C receptor induced by interferon: implications for depression associated with cytokine therapy.,"Members of the ADAR (adenosine deaminases acting on RNA) gene family are involved in one type of RNA editing that converts adenosine residues to inosine. The A-to-I editing of serotonin receptor subtype 2C (5-HT(2C)R) mRNA leads to replacement of three amino acid residues located within the intracellular loop II domain, resulting in dramatic alterations in G-protein coupling functions of the receptor. It has been speculated that RNA editing may play a role in several pharmacological and behavioral processes where the serotonergic plasticity is mediated through 5-HT(2C)R. Interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) often causes severe depression in patients treated for chronic viral hepatitis and certain malignancies. In this study, we examined the effects of IFN-alpha on RNA editing in human glioblastoma cell lines, which express 5-HT(2C)R mRNAs. ADAR1 expression and the pattern of the 5-HT(2C)R mRNA editing rapidly changed in response to IFN-alpha, leading to the dominant expression of the 5-HT(2C)R-VSI isoform predicted to have reduced G-protein coupling functions. Our results support the hypothesis that 5-HT(2C)R mRNA editing has causative relevance in the pathophysiology of depression associated with cytokine therapy.",2004 Apr 29,Brain Res Mol Brain Res. 2004 Apr 29;124(1):70-8. doi: 10.1016/j.molbrainres.2004.02.010.,"['Yang W', 'Wang Q', 'Kanes SJ', 'Murray JM', 'Nishikura K']",True
15039537,Hepatitis D virus RNA editing is inhibited by a GFP fusion protein containing a C-terminally deleted delta antigen.,"During its life cycle, hepatitis D virus (HDV) produces two forms of delta antigen (HDAg), small delta antigen (SDAg) and large delta antigen (LDAg), which differ in their C-terminal 19 amino acids. Host enzymes termed ADARs (adenosine deaminases that act on double-stranded RNA) are required for LDAg production. These enzymes change the stop codon (UAG) of SDAg to a tryptophan codon (UGG). However, the temporal and spatial regulation of HDV RNA editing is largely unknown. In this study, we constructed three GFP fusion proteins containing different lengths of SDAg and characterized their cellular localization and effects on HDV replication. One of these fusion proteins, designated D(1-88)-GFP, inhibited LDAg but not SDAg production, suggesting that D(1-88)-GFP inhibits HDV RNA editing. Two experiments further supported this supposition: (i). RT-PCR analysis combined with NcoI restriction enzyme digestion revealed that HDV RNA editing was reduced by 42% in HeLa-D(1-88)-GFP when compared with HeLa cells; and (ii). the ratio of SDAg/LDAg production from the reporter RNAs was reduced in cells co-transfected with ADAR-expressing and reporter plasmids in the presence of D(1-88)-GFP. Double fluorescence microscopy found that D(1-88)-GFP was either associated with SC-35 or was adjacent to PML (premyelocytic leukaemia antigen) at nuclear speckles, but D(1-88)-GFP was not co-localized with ADAR, which was mainly located in the nucleolus. In situ hybridization showing co-localization of HDV RNA with D(1-88)-GFP at nuclear speckles suggested that HDV RNA editing might occur in the nuclear speckles and require other nuclear factor(s), in addition to ADAR.",2004 Apr,J Gen Virol. 2004 Apr;85(Pt 4):947-957. doi: 10.1099/vir.0.19661-0.,"['Shih KN', 'Chuang YT', 'Liu H', 'Lo SJ']",True
15342791,Interaction of the Zalpha domain of human ADAR1 with a negatively supercoiled plasmid visualized by atomic force microscopy.,"Interest to the left-handed DNA conformation has been recently boosted by the findings that a number of proteins contain the Zalpha domain, which has been shown to specifically recognize Z-DNA. The biological function of Zalpha is presently unknown, but it has been suggested that it may specifically direct protein regions of Z-DNA induced by negative supercoiling in actively transcribing genes. Many studies, including a crystal structure in complex with Z-DNA, have focused on the human ADAR1 Zalpha domain in isolation. We have hypothesized that the recognition of a Z-DNA sequence by the Zalpha(ADAR1) domain is context specific, occurring under energetic conditions, which favor Z-DNA formation. To test this hypothesis, we have applied atomic force microscopy to image Zalpha(ADAR1) complexed with supercoiled plasmid DNAs. We have demonstrated that the Zalpha(ADAR1) binds specifically to Z-DNA and preferentially to d(CG)(n) inserts, which require less energy for Z-DNA induction compared to other sequences. A notable finding is that site-specific Zalpha binding to d(GC)(13) or d(GC)(2)C(GC)(10) inserts is observed when DNA supercoiling is insufficient to induce Z-DNA formation. These results indicate that Zalpha(ADAR1) binding facilities the B-to-Z transition and provides additional support to the model that Z-DNA binding proteins may regulate biological processes through structure-specific recognition.",2004,Nucleic Acids Res. 2004 Sep 1;32(15):4704-12. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkh810.

Candidate ADAR substrates are identified by cleaving poly (A)+ RNA specifically after inosine and using differential display to detect cleaved molecules. To confirm the presence of inosine, each individual candidate substrate is amplified by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and the PCR product is directly sequenced.

12952466,Substrate analogues for an RNA-editing adenosine deaminase: mechanistic investigation and inhibitor design.,"ADARs are adenosine deaminases that act on RNA and are responsible for RNA-editing reactions that occur in eukaryotic mRNAs, including the mRNAs of glutamate and serotonin receptors. ADARs capable of editing biologically relevant RNA substrates have been identified. In addition, the consequence of the RNA-editing reaction on the function of the gene product is known in several cases. However, our understanding of the chemical mechanism of the ADAR-catalyzed adenosine deamination in RNA is lagging. By studying analogues of a naturally occurring substrate for ADAR2, we infer features of the enzyme's active site and reaction mechanism. 8-Aza substitution at adenosine in various RNA substrates accelerates the rate of deamination at these sites by ADAR2 (2.8-17-fold). The magnitude of this ""aza effect"" depends on the RNA structural context of the reacting nucleotide. N(6)-Methyladenosine in RNA is a slow substrate for ADAR2 (rate is 2% that of adenosine), with no product observed with N(6)-ethyladenosine, suggesting a limited size of the leaving group pocket. 2,6-Diaminopurine ribonucleoside in RNA is not a substrate for ADAR, in contrast to adenosine deaminase (ADA), which catalyzes a similar reaction on nucleosides. This and other results indicate that ADAR2 uses a base recognition strategy different from that of ADA. Consistent with the large 8-aza effect observed for the ADAR2 reaction, we find that 8-azanebularine, as the free nucleoside, inhibits the ADAR2 reaction (IC(50) = 15 +/- 3 mM) with no inhibition observed with nebularine or coformycin.",2003 Sep 10,J Am Chem Soc. 2003 Sep 10;125(36):10867-76. doi: 10.1021/ja029742d.,"['Véliz EA', 'Easterwood LM', 'Beal PA']",True
12925995,Recognition of double-stranded RNA by proteins and small molecules.,"Molecular recognition of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is a key event for numerous biological pathways including the trafficking, editing, and maturation of cellular RNA, the interferon antiviral response, and RNA interference. Over the past several years, our laboratory has studied proteins and small molecules that bind dsRNA with the goal of understanding and controlling the binding selectivity. In this review, we discuss members of the dsRBM class of proteins that bind dsRNA. The dsRBM is an approximately 70 amino acid sequence motif found in a variety of dsRNA-binding proteins. Recent results have led to a new appreciation of the ability of these proteins to bind selectivity to certain sites on dsRNA. This property is discussed in light of the RNA selectivity observed in the function of two proteins that contain dsRBMs, the RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) and an adenosine deaminase that acts on dsRNA (ADAR2). In addition, we introduce peptide-acridine conjugates (PACs), small molecules designed to control dsRBM-RNA interactions. These intercalating molecules bear variable peptide appendages at opposite edges of an acridine heterocycle. This design imparts the potential to exploit differences in groove characteristics and/or base-pair dynamics at binding sites to achieve selective binding.",2003 Sep,Biopolymers. 2003 Sep;70(1):86-102. doi: 10.1002/bip.10413.,"['Carlson CB', 'Stephens OM', 'Beal PA']",True
14559151,"Glutamate receptor RNA editing: a molecular analysis of GluR2, GluR5 and GluR6 in human brain tissues and in NT2 cells following in vitro neural differentiation.","The properties of some glutamate receptors are modified by RNA editing. This post-transcriptional mechanism involves the enzymatic deamination of specific adenosines in the pre-mRNA of the glutamate receptors, performed by specific RNA adenosine deaminases (ADARs). This event gives rise to the substitution of a gene-encoded amino acid with a different one that modifies the physiological properties of the ion channel. Here we report an analysis of the editing levels of AMPA GluR2, and kainate GluR5 and GluR6 in a human teratocarcinoma cell line (NT2) during in vitro neural differentiation, in conjunction with an analysis of the expression levels of GluR and ADAR genes. The editing levels were analysed using a specific standardised assay based on sequence analysis. This assay can be performed on all editing sites with a high level of sensitivity and reproducibility. Whereas GluR gene expression increased during NT2 neural differentiation, the expression of ADAR genes may be detected at comparable levels even in undifferentiated NT2 cells, remaining relatively stable during the differentiation process. Furthermore, most of the glutamate receptor editing sites increased their editing levels during NT2 neural differentiation, suggesting that the level of ADAR mRNAs is not closely related to the variable editing levels detected in the GluRs analysed. In human brain tissues, the editing levels appeared finely modulated in the different areas, indicating the possible formation of ion channels with different functional properties, thus generating a complex tissue-specific regulation of receptors and modulation of excitatory stimuli.",2003 Oct 7,Brain Res Mol Brain Res. 2003 Oct 7;117(2):168-78. doi: 10.1016/s0169-328x(03)00317-6.,"['Barbon A', 'Vallini I', 'La Via L', 'Marchina E', 'Barlati S']",True
14612560,Modulation of RNA editing by functional nucleolar sequestration of ADAR2.,"The adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADARs) catalyze the site-specific conversion of adenosine to inosine (A to I) in primary mRNA transcripts, thereby affecting the splicing pattern or coding potential of mature mRNAs. Although the subnuclear localization of A-to-I editing has not been precisely defined, ADARs have been shown to act before splicing, suggesting that they function near nucleoplasmic sites of transcription. Here we demonstrate that ADAR2, a member of the vertebrate ADAR family, is concentrated in the nucleolus, a subnuclear domain disparate from the sites of mRNA transcription. Selective inhibition of ribosomal RNA synthesis or the introduction of mutations in the double-stranded RNA-binding domains within ADAR2 results in translocation of the protein to the nucleoplasm, suggesting that nucleolar association of ADAR2 depends on its ability to bind to ribosomal RNA. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching reveals that ADAR2 can shuttle rapidly between subnuclear compartments. Enhanced translocation of endogenous ADAR2 from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm results in increased editing of endogenous ADAR2 substrates. These observations indicate that the nucleolar localization of ADAR2 represents an important mechanism by which RNA editing can be modulated by the sequestration of enzymatic activity from potential RNA substrates in the nucleoplasm.",2003 Nov 25,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2003 Nov 25;100(24):14018-23. doi: 10.1073/pnas.2336131100.

12954622,Intracellular localization of differentially regulated RNA-specific adenosine deaminase isoforms in inflammation.,"Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing is a post-transcriptional process that amplifies the repertoire of protein production. Recently, the induction of this process through up-regulation of the editing enzyme RNA-specific adenosine deaminase 1 (ADAR1) was documented during acute inflammation. Here we report that the inflammation-induced up-regulation of ADAR1 involves differential production and intracellular localization of several isoforms with distinct RNA-binding domains and localization signals. These include the full-length ADAR1 (p150) and two functionally active short isoforms (p80 and p110). ADAR1 p80 starts at a methionine 519 (M519) due to alternative splicing in exon 2, which deletes the putative nuclear localization signal, the Z-DNA binding domain, and the entire RNA binding domain I. ADAR1 p110 is the mouse homologue of the human ADAR1 110-kDa variant (M246), which retains the second half of the Z-DNA binding domain, all RNA binding domains, and the deaminase domain. Additional variations are found in the third RNA binding domain of ADAR1; they are differentially regulated during inflammation, generating isoforms with different levels of activities. Studies in several cell types transfected with ADAR1-EGFP chimeras demonstrated that the p150 and p80 variants are localized in the cytoplasm and nucleolus, respectively. In agreement with this observation, endogenous ADAR1 was identified in the cytoplasm and nucleolus of mouse splenocytes and HeLa cells. Since the ADAR1 variants are differentially regulated during acute inflammation, it suggests that the localization of these variants and of A-to-I RNA editing in the cytoplasm, nucleus, and nucleolus is intracellularly reorganized in response to inflammatory stimulation.",2003 Nov 14,J Biol Chem. 2003 Nov 14;278(46):45833-42. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M308612200.

12618436,Requirement of dimerization for RNA editing activity of adenosine deaminases acting on RNA.,"Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADAR) convert adenosine residues into inosines in double-stranded RNA. Three vertebrate ADAR gene family members, ADAR1, ADAR2, and ADAR3, have been identified. The catalytic domain of all three ADAR gene family members is very similar to that of Escherichia coli cytidine deaminase and APOBEC-1. Homodimerization is essential for the enzyme activity of those cytidine deaminases. In this study, we investigated the formation of complexes between differentially epitope-tagged ADAR monomers by sequential affinity chromatography and size exclusion column chromatography. Both ADAR1 and ADAR2 form a stable enzymatically active homodimer complex, whereas ADAR3 remains as a monomeric, enzymatically inactive form. No heterodimer complex formation among different ADAR gene family members was detected. Analysis of HeLa and mouse brain nuclear extracts suggested that endogenous ADAR1 and ADAR2 both form a homodimer complex. Interestingly, endogenous ADAR3 also appears to form a homodimer complex, indicating the presence of a brain-specific mechanism for ADAR3 dimerization. Homodimer formation may be necessary for ADAR to act as active deaminases.

12665561,Dynamic association of RNA-editing enzymes with the nucleolus.,"ADAR1 and ADAR2 are editing enzymes that deaminate adenosine to inosine in long double stranded RNA duplexes and specific pre-mRNA transcripts. Here, we show that full-length and N-terminally truncated forms of ADAR1 are simultaneously expressed in HeLa and COS7 cells owing to the usage of alternative starting methionines. Because the N-terminus of ADAR1 contains a nuclear export signal, the full-length protein localizes predominantly in the cytoplasm, whereas the N-terminally truncated forms are exclusively nuclear and accumulate in the nucleolus. ADAR2, which lacks a region homologous to the N-terminal domain of ADAR1, localizes exclusively to the nucleus and similarly accumulates in the nucleolus. Within the nucleolus, ADAR1 and ADAR2 co-localize in a novel compartment. Photobleaching experiments demonstrate that, in live cells, ADAR1 and ADAR2 are in constant flux in and out of the nucleolus. When cells express the editing-competent glutamate receptor GluR-B RNA, endogenous ADAR1 and ADAR2 de-localize from the nucleolus and accumulate at sites where the substrate transcripts accumulate. This suggests that ADAR1 and ADAR2 are constantly moving through the nucleolus and might be recruited onto specific editing substrates present elsewhere in the cell.",2003 May 1,J Cell Sci. 2003 May 1;116(Pt 9):1805-18. doi: 10.1242/jcs.00371.,"['Desterro JM', 'Keegan LP', 'Lafarga M', 'Berciano MT', ""O'Connell M"", 'Carmo-Fonseca M']",True

Here we observed that ADAR1-L was >70-fold more active than was ADAR1-S when assayed with a substrate that could be edited in either the nucleus or cytoplasm, and was also much more active when assayed with a substrate that was generated in the cytoplasm during viral replication. In contrast, when a substrate that could only be edited within the nucleus was assayed, the activity of ADAR1-S was found to be somewhat higher than that of ADAR1-L. We show here not only that editing could occur in the cytoplasm but also that the process was extremely efficient, occurred rapidly, and could occur in the absence of translation. Consistent with the observation that editing in the cytoplasm can be very efficient, deletion of the nuclear localization signal from ADAR2 resulted in a protein with 15-fold higher activity when tested with a substrate that contained an editing site in the mature message. In addition to its potential role in an antiviral response, we propose that ADAR1-L is the form primarily responsible for editing mRNAs in which the editing site is retained after processing.",2003 May,RNA. 2003 May;9(5):586-98. doi: 10.1261/rna.5160403.,"['Wong SK', 'Sato S', 'Lazinski DW']",False

A-to-I RNA editing has been previously reported in the pre-mRNAs of brain glutamate and serotonin receptors and in lung tissue during inflammation. Here we report that systemic inflammation markedly induces inosine-containing mRNA to approximately 5% of adenosine in total mRNA. Induction was the result of up-regulation of A-to-I RNA editing as both dsRNA editing activity and ADAR1 expression were increased in the spleen, thymus and peripheral lymphocytes from endotoxin-treated mice. Up-regulation of ADAR1 was confirmed in vitro in T lymphocytes and macrophages stimulated with a variety of inflammatory mediators including tumour necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma. A late induction of RNA editing was detected in concanavalin A-activated splenocytes stimulated with interleukin-2 in vitro. Taken together, these data suggest that a large number of inosine-containing mRNAs are produced during acute inflammation via up-regulation of ADAR1-mediated RNA editing.

This type of editing has mainly been found in genes involved in neurotransmission. Site-specific A to I modifications often require intronic sequences to create the double-stranded structure necessary for editing. A system was developed to investigate if editing and splicing of pre-mRNA are coordinated. We have focused on a selectively edited site (R/G) in the glutamate receptor subunit B pre-mRNA. This editing site is situated in close proximity to a 5' splice site. To ensure efficient splicing, the editing site, together with its natural 5' splice site, was fused to a 3' splice site of the major late transcript from adenovirus. In vitro, on a premade transcript, ADAR2 editing and splicing were found to interfere with each other. The stable stem-loop required for ADAR2 editing had a negative effect on in vitro splicing, possibly by sequestering the 5' splice site. Further, RNA helicase A was shown to overcome the splicing inhibition caused by ADAR2. In vivo, allowing cotranscriptional processing, the same construct was found to efficiently edit and splice without interference, suggesting that the two RNA processing events are coordinated.",2003 Mar,RNA. 2003 Mar;9(3):309-18. doi: 10.1261/rna.2750803.,"['Bratt E', 'Ohman M']",True

The minimum region required for dimerization is the N-terminus and dsRNA-binding domain 1 (dsRBD1). Single point mutations within dsRBD1 abolish RNA-binding activity and dimer formation. These mutations and glycerol gradient analysis indicate that binding to dsRNA is important for dimerization. However, dimerization can be uncoupled from dsRNA-binding activity, as a deletion of the N-terminus (amino acids 1-46) yields a monomeric ADAR that retains the ability to bind dsRNA but is inactive in an editing assay, demonstrating that ADAR is only active as a dimer. Different isoforms of ADAR with different editing activities can form heterodimers and this can have a significant effect on editing in vitro as well as in vivo. We propose a model for ADAR dimerization whereby ADAR monomers first contact dsRNA; however, it is only when the second monomer binds and a dimer is formed that deamination occurs.",2003 Jul 1,EMBO J. 2003 Jul 1;22(13):3421-30. doi: 10.1093/emboj/cdg327.,"['Gallo A', 'Keegan LP', 'Ring GM', ""O'Connell MA""]",True

We have used this method to study the interaction between the RNA editing enzyme ADAR2 and RNA transcripts containing selective and nonselective editing sites. The natural selectively edited R/G site from glutamate receptor subunit B (GluR-B) was inserted into an RNA backbone molecule consisting of a completely double-stranded (ds) central part and incompletely paired ends derived from potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTVd). This molecule was efficiently edited at the R/G site, but promiscuous editing occurred at nonselective sites in the completely double-stranded region. The construct was also used to analyze binding of ADAR2 to wild-type and modified R/G editing sites in relation to binding at other nonselectively edited sites. Editing analysis together with SFM allow us to differentiate between binding and enzymatic activity. ADAR2 has been reported to have a general affinity to dsRNA. However, we show that there is a prominent bias for stable binding at sites selectively edited over other edited sites. On the other hand, promiscuous editing at nonselective sites apparently results from transient binding of the enzyme to the substrate. Furthermore, we find distinct sites with nonproductive binding of the enzyme.",2003 Jul,RNA. 2003 Jul;9(7):839-46. doi: 10.1261/rna.2167603.,"['Klaue Y', 'Källman AM', 'Bonin M', 'Nellen W', 'Ohman M']",True
12859334,Low editing efficiency of GluR2 mRNA is associated with a low relative abundance of ADAR2 mRNA in white matter of normal human brain.,"The ionotropic glutamate receptor (GluR) subunits GluR2, GluR5 and GluR6 are subject to RNA editing at their Q/R sites, resulting in significant alterations in the channel properties of the receptors. RNA editing at the Q/R site of GluRs is both developmentally and regionally regulated. Here we provide the first quantitative measurements of both mRNAs of the GluR subunits and mRNAs of the RNA editing enzymes ADAR1-ADAR3 in a comparison of the efficiency of editing at the Q/R site with the expression levels of ADAR mRNA in human brain. We demonstrate that the Q/R site of GluRs in white matter is edited significantly less than in grey matter. In addition, by means of quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction methods, we demonstrate that the relative abundance of ADAR2 mRNA to GluR2 mRNA is significantly lower in white matter than in grey matter and that the GluR2 Q/R site editing decreased only when the ratio of ADAR2 mRNA (not that of ADAR1 mRNA) to GluR2 mRNA dropped below a threshold (20 x 10(-3)). These results suggest that Q/R site of GluRs editing is regulated in a regional, and hence presumably cell-specific, manner and that the GluR2 Q/R site editing is critically regulated by ADAR2 in human brain.",2003 Jul,Eur J Neurosci. 2003 Jul;18(1):23-33. doi: 10.1046/j.1460-9568.2003.02718.x.,"['Kawahara Y', 'Ito K', 'Sun H', 'Kanazawa I', 'Kwak S']",True
12568723,Functional analysis of the KCS-like element of the interferon-inducible RNA-specific adenosine deaminase ADAR1 promoter.,"The ADAR1 gene encodes an RNA-specific adenosine deaminase that alters the functional activity of both viral and cellular RNAs by posttranscriptional adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing. The interferon (IFN) responsive PI promoter of the ADAR1 gene possesses an IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) responsible for IFN-inducibility, as well as an adjacent upstream sequence, designated kinase conserved sequence-like (KCS-l) element. The KCS-l element is similar to the 15-bp KCS element so far unique to the human and mouse RNA-dependent PKR kinase gene promoters. The KCS element of the PKR kinase (PKR) promoter is essential for both basal and IFN-inducible PKR promoter activity. We have now examined the functional properties of the KCS-l element of the ADAR1 PI promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) detected constitutively expressed nuclear proteins that bound selectively to the ADAR1 KCS-l element. Competition EMSA and antibody supershift assays indicated that ADAR1 KCS-l-binding proteins shared some properties with PKR KCS-binding proteins. However, transient transfection analyses performed with ADAR1 PI promoter constructs possessing deletion and substitution mutant forms of the KCS-l element revealed that the ADAR1 KCS-l element was not essential for either basal or IFN-inducible promoter activity. Substitution of the ADAR1 KCS-l element with the PKR KCS element increased both basal and inducible ADAR1 PI promoter activity. These results suggest that the KCS-l element of the ADAR1 PI promoter is not functionally equivalent to the KCS element of the PKR promoter.",2003 Jan 30,Gene. 2003 Jan 30;304:143-9. doi: 10.1016/s0378-1119(02)01200-3.,"['Markle D', 'Das S', 'Ward SV', 'Samuel CE']",True
12568612,Efficient C2'alpha-hydroxylation of deoxyribose in protein-induced Z-form DNA.,"DNA local conformations are thought to play an important biological role in processes such as gene expression by altering DNA-protein interactions. Although left-handed Z-form DNA is one of the best-characterized and significant local structures of DNA, having been extensively investigated for more than two decades, the biological relevance of Z-form DNA remains unclear. This is presumably due to the lack of a versatile detection method in a living cell. Previously, we demonstrated that the incorporation of a methyl group at the guanine C8 position (m(8)G) dramatically stabilizes the Z-form of short oligonucleotides in a variety of sequences. To develop a photochemical method to detect Z-form DNA, we examined the photoreaction of 5-iodouracil-containing Z-form d(CGCG(I)UGCG)(ODN 1)/d(Cm(8)GCAm(8)GCG)(ODN 2) in 2 M NaCl and found stereospecific C2'alpha-hydroxylation occurred at G(4) to provide d(CGCrGUGCG), 5. Recently, Rich and co-workers [Schwartz et al. Science 1999, 284, 1841. Schwartz et al. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001, 8, 761] found that an ubiquitous RNA editing enzyme, adenosine deaminase 1 (ADAR1), and tumor-associated protein DML-1 specifically bind to Z-form DNA. In the present study, we investigate the photoreactivity of octanucleotide ODN 1-2 in Z-form induced by Zalpha, which is the NH(2)-terminal domain of ADAR1 responsible for tight binding of ADAR1. Detailed product analysis revealed that the C2'alpha-hydroxylated products 5 and 6 produced significantly higher yields in Z-form ODN 1-2 induced by Zalpha compared with that in 2 M NaCl. Upon treatment with ribonuclease T1, 5 and 6 were quantitatively hydrolyzed at the 3'-phosphodiester bond of the rG residue to provide d(UGCG) as a common hydrolyzed fragment on the 3' side. Quantitative analysis demonstrated that the amount of photochemically formed 5 and 6 from ODN 1-2 directly correlated with the proportion of Z-form induced by Zalpha or NaCl. These results suggest that this photochemical and enzymatic procedure can be used as a specific probe for the existence of local Z-form structure in cellular DNA.",2003 Feb 12,J Am Chem Soc. 2003 Feb 12;125(6):1526-31. doi: 10.1021/ja028388g.,"['Oyoshi T', 'Kawai K', 'Sugiyama H']",False

We report the identification and experimental verification of 16 previously unknown ADAR target genes in the fruit fly Drosophila and one in humans-more than the sum total previously reported. All of these genes are involved in rapid electrical and chemical neurotransmission, and many of the edited sites recode conserved and functionally important amino acids.

12907730,ADAR2 A-->I editing: site selectivity and editing efficiency are separate events.,"ADAR enzymes, adenosine deaminases that act on RNA, form a family of RNA editing enzymes that convert adenosine to inosine within RNA that is completely or largely double-stranded. Site-selective A-->I editing has been detected at specific sites within a few structured pre-mRNAs of metazoans. We have analyzed the editing selectivity of ADAR enzymes and have chosen to study the naturally edited R/G site in the pre-mRNA of the glutamate receptor subunit B (GluR-B). A comparison of editing by ADAR1 and ADAR2 revealed differences in the specificity of editing. Our results show that ADAR2 selectively edits the R/G site, while ADAR1 edits more promiscuously at several other adenosines in the double-stranded stem. To further understand the mechanism of selective ADAR2 editing we have investigated the importance of internal loops in the RNA substrate. We have found that the immediate structure surrounding the editing site is important. A purine opposite to the editing site has a negative effect on both selectivity and efficiency of editing. More distant internal loops in the substrate were found to have minor effects on site selectivity, while efficiency of editing was found to be influenced. Finally, changes in the RNA structure that affected editing did not alter the binding abilities of ADAR2. Overall these findings suggest that binding and catalysis are independent events.",2003 Aug 15,Nucleic Acids Res. 2003 Aug 15;31(16):4874-81. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkg681.,"['Källman AM', 'Sahlin M', 'Ohman M']",True
12719472,Distinct in vivo roles for double-stranded RNA-binding domains of the Xenopus RNA-editing enzyme ADAR1 in chromosomal targeting.,"The RNA-editing enzyme adenosine deaminase that acts on RNA (ADAR1) deaminates adenosines to inosines in double-stranded RNA substrates. Currently, it is not clear how the enzyme targets and discriminates different substrates in vivo. However, it has been shown that the deaminase domain plays an important role in distinguishing various adenosines within a given substrate RNA in vitro. Previously, we could show that Xenopus ADAR1 is associated with nascent transcripts on transcriptionally active lampbrush chromosomes, indicating that initial substrate binding and possibly editing itself occurs cotranscriptionally. Here, we demonstrate that chromosomal association depends solely on the three double-stranded RNA-binding domains (dsRBDs) found in the central part of ADAR1, but not on the Z-DNA-binding domain in the NH2 terminus nor the catalytic deaminase domain in the COOH terminus of the protein. Most importantly, we show that individual dsRBDs are capable of recognizing different chromosomal sites in an apparently specific manner. Thus, our results not only prove the requirement of dsRBDs for chromosomal targeting, but also show that individual dsRBDs have distinct in vivo localization capabilities that may be important for initial substrate recognition and subsequent editing specificity.",2003 Apr 28,J Cell Biol. 2003 Apr 28;161(2):309-19. doi: 10.1083/jcb.200301034.,"['Doyle M', 'Jantsch MF']",True
13679660,Juvenile arteritis revisited. Buerger's disease-Takayasu's disease.,"Thromboangiitis obliterans is defined as an inflammatory disease involving small and medium sized arteries and veins. As no clinical symptoms, signs, radiological or laboratory abnormalities nor pathological features are specific, the diagnosis is usually made according the criteria proposed by Adar in a young smoker, male or female, with distal arterial occlusions sometimes associated with thrombophlebitis and with negative aetiological investigations. Recently, rheumatic manifestations were identified in about 10% of patients. If new developments in vascular medicine, as ultrasound explorations or CT scan limit the indications for angiography, others, especially in the field of thrombophilia, make more difficult the differential diagnosis. If the strong link between the disease activity and smoking habits is confirmed, medical or surgical approach remain disappointing. Takayasu's disease or non specific aorto-arteritis is an inflammatory disease of young women that primarily affects the aorta its main branches and the pulmonary arteries. The disease often start in children. The prevalence of the disease as the arterial lesions show geographical variations. That and the different associations with infectious, rheumatic or systemic diseases could justify to consider Takayasu's disease as a syndrome. B-mode ultrasonography and electron beam computed tomography are usually sufficient to characterize the arterial involvement and are essential for the follow up of patients. In some rare cases arterial biopsy is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. The surgical treatment concerns specific lesions with ischemic symptoms and failure of the medical approach, however endovascular techniques are often discussed in first intention. During inflammatory phases with evolutive lesions corticosteroids are often used.

12080062,Two novel transcripts for human endothelin B receptor produced by RNA editing/alternative splicing from a single gene.,"Hirschsprung disease is a heterogeneous genetic disorder, causative genes of which include the endothelin B receptor (ETB). To investigate the mutations of ETB in Hirschsprung disease, expression of the ETB gene in lymphoblastoid cells from patients and normal healthy adults was examined, and novel mutant transcripts were found. The mutant ETB gene transcripts lacked a 134-bp nucleotide sequence corresponding to exon 5, and some also contained a substitution from A to G at position 950 in exon 4, resulting in an amino acid substitution from glutamine (Q) to arginine (R). This substitution was suspected to be the result of RNA editing because it was not present in the genomic sequence. Transfection experiments using ETB minigenes containing the editing site with or without the gene for double-strand RNA deaminases (ADAR1 and ADAR2) revealed that the deaminases were involved in RNA editing. Furthermore, a c-Myc-tagged mutant ETB protein was not detected by Western blot analysis. The present results show that the mutant ETB transcripts were novel splice variants, which might not be translated, or that the products translated from splice variants might be quickly degraded, presumably because of their instability. The preferential production of this null function ETB by RNA editing/splicing could be involved in the etiology of some cases of Hirschsprung disease.",2002 Sep 6,J Biol Chem. 2002 Sep 6;277(36):33205-12. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M203972200.

12243919,Transcript mutations of the alpha regulatory subunit of protein kinase A and up-regulation of the RNA-editing gene transcript in lupus T lymphocytes.,"BACKGROUND: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disorder characterised by diverse dysfunctions of immune effector cells, including proliferation and cytotoxicity. In T cells from patients with SLE, activity of type 1 protein kinase A isozymes is greatly reduced because of decreased expression of the alpha and beta regulatory subunits (RI alpha and RI beta). We aimed to identify a molecular mechanism or mechanisms for this isozyme deficiency by assessing occurrence of mutations in transcripts of the RI alpha subunit in patients with SLE. METHODS: We cloned and sequenced cDNA of RI alpha and corresponding genomic DNA of the coding region to detect sequence changes from eight patients with SLE and six healthy controls. Because transcript editing is regulated by adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADAR), we quantified expression of ADAR1 transcripts in SLE and control T cells by competitive PCR. FINDINGS: Sequence analyses of cDNA showed heterogeneous transcript mutations, including deletions, transitions, and transversions. We identified 1.22 x 10(-3)/bp transcript mutations in SLE T cells-a frequency 7.5 times higher than that in control T cells. By contrast, we identified no genomic mutations. Two hotspots were identified in the RI alpha subunit transcripts from SLE T cells, one located adjacent to a pseudosubstrate site of the RI alpha subunit and the other a component of the cAMP binding A domain. ADAR1 mRNA content was 3.5 times higher in SLE cells than in control T cells (p=0.001). INTERPRETATION: An RNA-editing enzyme could be converting adenosine to inosine within double-stranded regions of RNA, resulting in transcript mutations. This process could be one mechanism resulting in mutations in the RI alpha subunit of type 1 protein kinase A.",2002 Sep 14,Lancet. 2002 Sep 14;360(9336):842-9. doi: 10.1016/s0140-6736(02)09966-x.,"['Laxminarayana D', 'Khan IU', 'Kammer G']",False

Editing of the human GluR-B transcript is catalyzed by the enzyme ADAR2 at the Q/R and R/G sites. We have established a minimal RNA substrate for editing based on the R/G site and have characterized the interaction of ADAR2 with this RNA by gel shift, kinetic, and cross-linking analyses. Gel shift analysis revealed that two complexes are formed on the RNA as protein concentration is increased; the ADAR monomers can be cross-linked to one another in an RNA-dependent fashion. We performed a detailed kinetic study of the editing reaction; the data from this study are consistent with a reaction scheme in which formation of an ADAR2.RNA ternary complex is required for efficient RNA editing and in which formation of this complex is rate determining. These observations suggest that RNA adenosine deaminases function as homodimers on their RNA substrates and may partially explain regulation of RNA editing in these systems.",2002 Oct 4,J Biol Chem. 2002 Oct 4;277(40):37624-9. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M204126200.

Because the biological consequences of ADAR2 function are significant, we have undertaken a phylogenetic comparison of these features. Here we report a comparison of cDNA sequences, genomic organization, editing site sequences and patterns of alternative splicing of ADAR2 genes from human, mouse, chicken, pufferfish and zebrafish.

12228285,Tissue selectivity of interferon-stimulated gene expression in mice infected with Dam(+) versus Dam(-) Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strains.,"The host interferon (IFN) system plays an important role in protection against microbial infections. Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is highly virulent in the mouse model, whereas mutants that lack DNA adenine methylase (Dam(-)) are highly attenuated and elicit fully protective immune responses against murine typhoid fever. We examined the expression of IFN-responsive genes in several mouse tissues following infection with Dam(+) or Dam(-) Salmonella. Infection of mice with Dam(+) Salmonella resulted in the induction of host genes known to be indicators of IFN bioactivity and regulated by either IFN-alpha/beta (Mx1) or IFN-gamma (class II transactivator protein [CIITA] and inducible nitric oxide synthase [iNOS]) or by both IFN-alpha/beta and IFN-gamma (RNA-specific adenosine deaminase [ADAR1] and RNA-dependent protein kinase [PKR]) in a tissue-specific manner compared to uninfected animals. Since the Mx1 promoter is IFN-alpha/beta specific and the Mx1 gene is not inducible directly by IFN-gamma, these data suggest a role of IFN-alpha/beta in the host response to Salmonella infection. Mice infected with Dam(-) Salmonella showed reduced expression of the same set of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) as that observed after infection with wild-type Salmonella. The reduced capacity to induce ISGs persisted in Dam(-)-vaccinated mice after challenge with the virulent (Dam(+)) strain. Finally, although no Dam(-) organisms were recovered from the liver or spleen after oral infection of mice, ADAR, PKR, Mx, and CIITA expression levels were elevated in these tissues relative to those in uninfected mice, suggestive of the distant action of a signaling molecule(s) in the activation of ISG expression.",2002 Oct,Infect Immun. 2002 Oct;70(10):5579-88. doi: 10.1128/IAI.70.10.5579-5588.2002.,"['Shtrichman R', 'Heithoff DM', 'Mahan MJ', 'Samuel CE']",True

12399548,Replicating hepatitis delta virus RNA is edited in the nucleus by the small form of ADAR1.,"Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) uses a host-encoded RNA-editing activity to express its two essential proteins from the same coding sequence. Adenosine deaminase that acts on RNA (ADAR)1 and ADAR2 are enzymes that catalyze such reactions, and each, when overexpressed, are capable of editing HDV RNA in vivo. However, the enzyme responsible for editing HDV RNA during replication has not been determined. Mammalian cells express two forms of ADAR1, a large form (ADAR1-L) that mainly localizes to the cytoplasm and a small form (ADAR1-S) that resides in the nucleus. Recently, we found that the specific activity of ADAR1-L within cells is much higher than that of ADAR1-S but only when the substrate can be edited in the cytoplasm. Here we observed that although both ADAR1-S and ADAR1-L were expressed throughout HDV replication, no ADAR2 could be observed at any time. Using expression vectors that individually overexpress either form of ADAR1, we found that ADAR1-S could stimulate editing during replication more efficiently. We next reduced ADAR1 levels during HDV replication. After transfection of an ADAR1-L-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA), we observed a significant loss of that protein and its associated cytoplasmic editing activity while the level of ADAR1-S remained unchanged. Transfection of this siRNA, however, did not reduce editing during HDV replication. In contrast, transfection of an siRNA that targets both forms of ADAR1 greatly reduced the expression of both proteins and potently inhibited editing during replication. We conclude that ADAR1-S edits HDV RNA during replication and that editing occurs in the nucleus.",2002 Nov 12,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2002 Nov 12;99(23):15118-23. doi: 10.1073/pnas.232416799.

A longer 150-kDa protein is interferon inducible and can be found both in the nucleus and cytoplasm. An amino-terminally truncated 110-kDa version, in contrast, is constitutively expressed and predominantly nuclear. In the absence of transcription, however, the shorter protein is also cytoplasmic and thus displays the hallmarks of a shuttling protein. The nuclear localization signal (NLS) of human hsADAR1 is atypical and overlaps with its third double-stranded RNA-binding domain (dsRBD). Herein, we identify regions in hsADAR1 that interfere with nuclear localization and mediate cytoplasmic accumulation. We show that interferon-inducible hsADAR1 contains a Crm1-dependent nuclear export signal in its amino terminus. Most importantly, we demonstrate that the first dsRBD of hsADAR1 interferes with nuclear localization of a reporter construct containing dsRBD3 as an active NLS. The same effect can be triggered by several other, but not all dsRBDs. Active RNA binding of either the inhibitory dsRBD1 or the NLS bearing dsRBD3 is required for cytoplasmic accumulation. Furthermore, hsADAR1's dsRBD1 has no effect on other NLSs, suggesting RNA-mediated cross talk between dsRBDs, possibly leading to masking of the NLS. A model, incorporating these findings is presented.

We previously developed a method to identify inosine-containing RNAs and used it to identify five ADAR substrates in Caenorhabditis elegans. Here we use the same method to identify five additional C. elegans substrates, including three mRNAs that encode proteins known to affect neuronal functions. All 10 of the C. elegans substrates are edited in long stem-loop structures located in noncoding regions, and thus contrast with previously identified substrates of other organisms, in which ADARs target codons. To determine whether editing in noncoding regions was a conserved ADAR function, we applied our method to poly(A)+ RNA of human brain and identified 19 previously unknown ADAR substrates. The substrates were strikingly similar to those observed in C. elegans, since editing was confined to 3' untranslated regions, introns, and a noncoding RNA. Also similar to what was found in C. elegans, 15 of the 19 substrates were edited in repetitive elements.

This gene segment fulfils substrate requirements for adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADARs): i.e. it is an A+U rich region of 137 residues, and 98 or 106 of them--for A/Mon/3/88 or Long HRSV strains, respectively--are predicted to form intramolecular base pairs leading to a stable RNA secondary structure. In addition, when sequences of the G gene from natural isolates are compared in terms of pairwise substitutions, A to G+G to A changes are preferentially observed in regions where stable intramolecular dsRNA secondary structures are predicted to occur. In this study, a model is proposed in which, in addition to nucleotide misincorporations, reiterative A to G changes in HRSV are generated by ADAR activity operating in short segments (100-200 ribonucleotide residues) of the HRSV genome with high tendency for intramolecular base pairing.",2002 Jun,J Gen Virol. 2002 Jun;83(Pt 6):1445-1455. doi: 10.1099/0022-1317-83-6-1445.,"['Martínez I', 'Melero JA']",False

One tumor showed a nodule-in-nodule appearance (NIN), which is occasionally observed in the course of progression of HCC from well to less differentiated grade, when an inner, moderately differentiated tumor (MD) develops sequentially from the outer, well-differentiated tumor (WD). Seventy-six genes were identified to be up-regulated more than 3-fold and 33 genes were down-regulated in the inner nodule in NIN. By statistical analysis of the profiles from 10 individual additional liver tumors, 5 WDs and 5 MDs, we were able to identify 12 genes, LAMA3, PPIB, ADAR, PSMD4, NDUFS8, D9SVA, CCT3, GBAP, ARD1, RDBP, CSRP2, and TLE1, with significantly elevated expression, and 4 genes, CP, IL7R, CD48, and PLGL, with decreased expression in MD. These selected genes were further validated using another 12 tumors, 5 WDs and 7 MDs, with semi-quantitative RT-PCR. We also applied neighborhood analysis to list the genes with high predictability values as most closely correlated with WD-MD distinction. Seven genes, ADAR, PSMD4, D9SVA, CCT3, GBAP, RDBP, and CSRP2, whose expression was elevated and one gene, IL7R, whose expression was decreased, were included among the top 50 predictor genes.

11842111,Complex regulation of the human gene for the Z-DNA binding protein DLM-1.,"Dlm-1 is a recently described gene which is upregulated in murine stromal cells lining tumors. The function of the 40 kDa DLM-1 protein is poorly understood. DLM-1 contains an N-terminal Z-DNA binding domain homologous to the Zalpha domain in the RNA editing enzyme ADAR1. We report the cloning of human and rat DLM-1. In addition to the Zalpha domain, three further conserved regions were identified. One of these is homologous to the second Z-DNA binding domain, Zbeta, of ADAR1. We find that human DLM-1 is predominantly expressed in lymphatic tissues. The gene spans 17 kb and consists of 10 exons. DNA transcripts are extremely heterogeneous as a result of alternative splicing and the usage of exon variants combined with at least two transcriptional start sites and 3'-terminal exons. The exon coding for the Zalpha domain was present in approximately one-third of the analyzed mRNAs. Nearly half of the transcripts contained exon variants that had premature stop codons incorporated. Based on our analysis, over 2000 different mRNAs may be produced due to alternative splicing and usage of different 5' and 3' ends. The cellular function of DLM-1 appears to call for a high degree of adaptation by this complex regulation.",2002 Feb 15,Nucleic Acids Res. 2002 Feb 15;30(4):993-1000. doi: 10.1093/nar/30.4.993.,"['Rothenburg S', 'Schwartz T', 'Koch-Nolte F', 'Haag F']",True

Of the two host genes responsible for RNA editing via deamination of adenosines in double-stranded RNAs, short inhibitory RNA-mediated knockdown of host ADAR1 expression but not that of ADAR2 led to decreased HDV amber/W editing and virus production. Despite substantial sequence and structural variation among the amber/W sites of the three HDV genotypes, ADAR1a was primarily responsible for editing all three.

12097551,RNA editing in hepatitis delta virus genotype III requires a branched double-hairpin RNA structure.,"RNA editing at the amber/W site plays a central role in the replication scheme of hepatitis delta virus (HDV), allowing the virus to produce two functionally distinct forms of the sole viral protein, hepatitis delta antigen (HDAg), from the same open reading frame. Editing is carried out by a cellular activity known as ADAR (adenosine deaminase), which acts on RNA substrates that are at least partially double stranded. In HDV genotype I, editing requires a highly conserved base-paired structure that occurs within the context of the unbranched rod structure characteristic of HDV RNA. This base-paired structure is disrupted in the unbranched rod of HDV genotype III, which is the most distantly related of the three known HDV genotypes and is associated with the most severe disease. Here I show that RNA editing in HDV genotype III requires a branched double-hairpin structure that deviates substantially from the unbranched rod structure, involving the rearrangement of nearly 80 bp. The structure includes a UNCG RNA tetraloop, a highly stable structural motif frequently involved in the folding of large RNAs such as rRNA. The double-hairpin structure is required for editing, and hence for virion formation, but not for HDV RNA replication, which requires the unbranched rod structure. HDV genotype III thus relies on a dynamic conformational switch between the two different RNA structures: the unbranched rod characteristic of HDV RNA and a branched double-hairpin structure that is required for RNA editing. The different mechanisms of editing in genotypes I and III underscore their functional differences and may be related to pathogenic differences as well.",2002 Aug,J Virol. 2002 Aug;76(15):7385-97. doi: 10.1128/jvi.76.15.7385-7397.2002.,['Casey JL'],True

Deletion of the KCS element or point mutations within the KCS element greatly reduce both basal and IFN-inducible PKR promoter activity. The IFN-inducible RNA-specific adenosine deaminase ADAR1 promoter possesses a KCS-like (KCS-l) element. The sequences of the KCS and KCS-l elements and their positions relative to the cognate ISRE element are similar between the PKR and ADAR1 promoters. However, substitution of the ADAR1 KCS-l element for the KCS element of the PKR promoter resulted in significantly reduced basal and IFN-inducible promoter activities comparable to either point mutation or entire deletion of the PKR KCS element. The PKR KCS element selectively bound nuclear proteins more efficiently than did the ADAR1 KCS-l element. Reversing the positions of the KCS and ISRE elements of the PKR promoter relative to one another or reversing the orientation of either element while conserving the naturally occurring 4-bp spacing between the two elements did not significantly reduce basal or IFN-inducible promoter activity. Taken together, these results are consistent with the notion that the KCS and ISRE elements of the PKR promoter function as a unit.",2002 Aug,J Interferon Cytokine Res. 2002 Aug;22(8):891-8. doi: 10.1089/107999002760274917.,"['Ward SV', 'Markle D', 'Das S', 'Samuel CE']",True
11907222,Increased RNA editing and inhibition of hepatitis delta virus replication by high-level expression of ADAR1 and ADAR2.,"Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) is a subviral human pathogen that uses specific RNA editing activity of the host to produce two essential forms of the sole viral protein, hepatitis delta antigen (HDAg). Editing at the amber/W site of HDV antigenomic RNA leads to the production of the longer form (HDAg-L), which is required for RNA packaging but which is a potent trans-dominant inhibitor of HDV RNA replication. Editing in infected cells is thought to be catalyzed by one or more of the cellular enzymes known as adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADARs). We examined the effects of increased ADAR1 and ADAR2 expression on HDV RNA editing and replication in transfected Huh7 cells. We found that both ADARs dramatically increased RNA editing, which was correlated with strong inhibition of HDV RNA replication. While increased HDAg-L production was the primary mechanism of inhibition, we observed at least two additional means by which ADARs can suppress HDV replication. High-level expression of both ADAR1 and ADAR2 led to extensive hyperediting at non-amber/W sites and subsequent production of HDAg variants that acted as trans-dominant inhibitors of HDV RNA replication. Moreover, we also observed weak inhibition of HDV RNA replication by mutated forms of ADARs defective for deaminase activity. Our results indicate that HDV requires highly regulated and selective editing and that the level of ADAR expression can play an important role: overexpression of ADARs inhibits HDV RNA replication and compromises virus viability.",2002 Apr,J Virol. 2002 Apr;76(8):3819-27. doi: 10.1128/jvi.76.8.3819-3827.2002.,"['Jayan GC', 'Casey JL']",True
11507200,Hepatitis delta virus minimal substrates competent for editing by ADAR1 and ADAR2.,"A host-mediated RNA-editing event allows hepatitis delta virus (HDV) to express two essential proteins, the small delta antigen (HDAg-S) and the large delta antigen (HDAg-L), from a single open reading frame. One or several members of the ADAR (adenosine deaminases that act on RNA) family are thought to convert the adenosine to an inosine (I) within the HDAg-S amber codon in antigenomic RNA. As a consequence of replication, the UIG codon is converted to a UGG (tryptophan [W]) codon in the resulting HDAg-L message. Here, we used a novel reporter system to monitor the editing of the HDV amber/W site in the absence of replication. In cultured cells, we observed that both human ADAR1 (hADAR1) and hADAR2 were capable of editing the amber/W site with comparable efficiencies. We also defined the minimal HDV substrate required for hADAR1- and hADAR2-mediated editing. Only 24 nucleotides from the amber/W site were sufficient to enable efficient editing by hADAR1. Hence, the HDV amber/W site represents the smallest ADAR substrate yet identified. In contrast, the minimal substrate competent for hADAR2-mediated editing contained 66 nucleotides.",2001 Sep,J Virol. 2001 Sep;75(18):8547-55. doi: 10.1128/jvi.75.18.8547-8555.2001.,"['Sato S', 'Wong SK', 'Lazinski DW']",False

The essential set of residues determined from this structure to be critical for Z-DNA recognition was used to search the database for other proteins with the potential for Z-DNA binding. We found that the tumor-associated protein DLM-1 contains a domain with remarkable sequence similarities to Z alpha(ADAR). Here we report the crystal structure of this DLM-1 domain bound to left-handed Z-DNA at 1.85 A resolution. Comparison of Z-DNA binding by DLM-1 and ADAR1 reveals a common structure-specific recognition core within the binding domain. However, the domains differ in certain residues peripheral to the protein-DNA interface.

11593027,The role of binding domains for dsRNA and Z-DNA in the in vivo editing of minimal substrates by ADAR1.,"RNA editing changes the read-out of genetic information, increasing the number of different protein products that can be made from a single gene. One form involves the deamination of adenosine to form inosine, which is subsequently translated as guanosine. The reaction requires a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) substrate and is catalyzed by the adenosine deaminase that act on dsRNA (ADAR) family of enzymes. These enzymes possess dsRNA-binding domains (DRBM) and a catalytic domain. ADAR1 so far has been found only in vertebrates and is characterized by two Z-DNA-binding motifs, the biological function of which remains unknown. Here the role of the various functional domains of ADAR1 in determining the editing efficiency and specificity of ADAR1 is examined in cell-based assays. A variety of dsRNA substrates was tested. It was found that a 15-bp dsRNA stem with a single base mismatch was sufficient for editing. The particular adenosine modified could be varied by changing the position of the mismatch. Editing efficiency could be increased by placing multiple pyrimidines 5' to the edited adenosine. With longer substrates, editing efficiency also increased and was partly due to the use of DRBMs. Additional editing sites were also observed that clustered on the complementary strand 11-15 bp from the first. An unexpected finding was that the DRBMs are not necessary for the editing of the shorter 15-bp substrates. However, mutation of the Z-DNA-binding domains of ADAR1 decreased the efficiency with which such a substrate was edited.",2001 Oct 9,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2001 Oct 9;98(21):12132-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.211419898.,"['Herbert A', 'Rich A']",True
11689059,Vaccinia virus E3L interferon resistance protein inhibits the interferon-induced adenosine deaminase A-to-I editing activity.,"The RNA-specific adenosine deaminase (ADAR1) is an interferon-inducible editing enzyme that converts adenosine to inosine. ADAR1 contains three distinct domains: a N-terminal Z-DNA binding domain that includes two Z-DNA binding motifs; a central double-stranded RNA binding domain that includes three dsRNA binding motifs (dsRBM); and a C-terminal catalytic domain responsible for A-to-I enzymatic activity. The E3L protein of vaccinia virus mediates interferon resistance. E3L, similar to ADAR1, also contains Z-DNA binding and dsRNA binding motifs. To assess the possible role of E3L in modulating RNA editing by ADAR1, we examined the effect of E3L on ADAR1 deaminase activity. Wild-type E3L protein was a potent inhibitor of ADAR1 deaminase enzymatic activity. Analysis of mutant E3L proteins indicated that the carboxy-proximal dsRBM of E3L was essential for antagonism of ADAR1. Surprisingly, disruption of the Z-DNA binding domain of E3L by double substitutions of two highly conserved residues also abolished its antagonistic activity, whereas deletion of the entire Z domain had little effect on the inhibition. With natural neurotransmitter pre-mRNA substrates, E3L weakly inhibited the site-selective editing activity by ADAR1 at the R/G site of the glutamate receptor B subunit (GluR-B) pre-mRNA and the A site of serotonin 2C receptor (5-HT2CR) pre-mRNA; editing of the intronic hotspot (+)60 site of GluR-B was not affected by E3L. These results demonstrate that the A-to-I RNA editing activity of the IFN-inducible adenosine deaminase is impaired by the product of the vaccinia virus E3L interferon resistance gene.",2001 Oct 25,Virology. 2001 Oct 25;289(2):378-87. doi: 10.1006/viro.2001.1154.,"['Liu Y', 'Wolff KC', 'Jacobs BL', 'Samuel CE']",True
11479320,Conformational changes that occur during an RNA-editing adenosine deamination reaction.,"ADARs are adenosine deaminases responsible for RNA-editing reactions that occur within duplex RNA. Currently little is known regarding the nature of the protein-RNA interactions that lead to site-selective adenosine deamination. We previously reported that ADAR2 induced changes in 2-aminopurine fluorescence of a modified substrate, consistent with a base-flipping mechanism. Additional data have been obtained using full-length ADAR2 and a protein comprising only the RNA binding domain (RBD) of ADAR2. The increase in 2-aminopurine fluorescence is specific to the editing site and dependent on the presence of the catalytic domain. Hydroxyl radical footprinting demonstrates that the RBD protects a region of the RNA duplex around the editing site, suggesting a significant role for the RBD in identifying potential ADAR2 editing sites. Nucleotides near the editing site on the non-edited strand become hypersensitive to hydrolytic cleavage upon binding of ADAR2 RBD. Therefore, the RBD may assist base flipping by increasing the conformational flexibility of nucleotides in the duplex adjacent to its binding site. In addition, an increase in tryptophan fluorescence is observed when ADAR2 binds duplex RNA, suggesting a conformational change in the catalytic domain of the enzyme. Furthermore, acrylamide quenching experiments indicate that RNA binding creates heterogeneity in the solvent accessibility of ADAR2 tryptophan residues, with one out of five tryptophans more solvent-accessible in the ADAR2.RNA complex.",2001 Oct 12,J Biol Chem. 2001 Oct 12;276(41):37827-33. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M106299200.

Furthermore, advances made while elucidating the IFN system have contributed significantly to our understanding in multiple areas of virology and molecular cell biology, ranging from pathways of signal transduction to the biochemical mechanisms of transcriptional and translational control to the molecular basis of viral pathogenesis. IFNs are approved therapeutics and have moved from the basic research laboratory to the clinic. Among the IFN-induced proteins important in the antiviral actions of IFNs are the RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR), the 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) and RNase L, and the Mx protein GTPases. Double-stranded RNA plays a central role in modulating protein phosphorylation and RNA degradation catalyzed by the IFN-inducible PKR kinase and the 2'-5'-oligoadenylate-dependent RNase L, respectively, and also in RNA editing by the IFN-inducible RNA-specific adenosine deaminase (ADAR1). IFN also induces a form of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS2) and the major histocompatibility complex class I and II proteins, all of which play important roles in immune response to infections.

Different promoters in the ADAR1 gene give rise to two forms of the protein: a constitutive promoter expresses a transcript encoding (c)ADAR1, and an interferon-induced promoter expresses a transcript encoding an N-terminally extended form, (i)ADAR1. Here we show that (c)ADAR1 is primarily nuclear whereas (i)ADAR1 encompasses a functional nuclear export signal in the N-terminal part and is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttle protein. Mutation of the nuclear export signal or treatment with the CRM1-specific drug leptomycin B induces nuclear accumulation of (i)ADAR1 fused to the green fluorescent protein and increases the nuclear editing activity. In concurrence, CRM1 and RanGTP interact specifically with the (i)ADAR1 nuclear export signal to form a tripartite export complex in vitro. Furthermore, our data imply that nuclear import of (i)ADAR1 is mediated by at least two nuclear localization sequences.

The present study aimed to identify a role for A-to-I RNA editing in the development of microvascular lung injury.

ADAR1 expression and activity were identified in sham lungs that were upregulated in lungs from endotoxin-treated mice (at 2 hours). Expression was localized to polymorphonuclear and monocytic cells. These events preceded the development of pulmonary edema and leukocyte accumulation in lung tissue and followed the local production of interferon-gamma, a known inducer of ADAR1 in other cell systems. ADAR1 was found to be upregulated in alveolar macrophages (MH-S cells) stimulated with endotoxin (1 to 100 microg/mL), live Escherichia coli (5x10(7) colony-forming units), or interferon-gamma (1000 U/mL).

So far, 27 genes of 3 related families encoding structural as well as regulatory proteins have been mapped within a 2-Mb region on chromosome 1q21. Here we report on the identification of 10 additional EDC genes by a powerful subtractive hybridization method using entire YACs (950_e_2 and 986_e_10) to screen a gridded human keratinocyte cDNA library. Localization of the detected cDNA clones has been established on a long-range restriction map covering more than 5 Mb of this genomic region. The genes encode cytoskeletal tropomyosin TM30nm (TPM3), HS1-binding protein Hax-1 (HAX1), RNA-specific adenosine deaminase (ADAR1), the 34/67-kD laminin receptor (LAMRL6), and the 26S proteasome subunit p31 (PSMD8L), as well as five hitherto uncharacterized proteins (NICE-1, NICE-2, NICE-3, NICE-4, and NICE-5).

ADAR1 and ADAR2 are homologs having two common functional regions, an N-terminal double-stranded RNA-binding domain and a C-terminal deaminase domain. It is neither understood why only certain adenosines within a substrate molecule serve as targets for ADARs, nor is it known which domain of an ADAR confers its specificity for particular editing sites. To assess the importance of several aspects of RNA sequence and structure on editing, we evaluated 20 different mutated substrates, derived from four editing sites, for their ability to be edited by either ADAR1 or ADAR2. We found that when these derivatives contained an A:C mismatch at the editing site, editing by both ADARs was enhanced compared to when A:A or A:G mismatches or A:U base pairs occurred at the same site. Hence substrate recognition and/or catalysis by ADARs could involve the base that opposes the edited adenosine. In addition, by using protein chimeras in which the deaminase domains were exchanged between ADAR1 and ADAR2, we found that this domain played a dominant role in defining the substrate specificity of the resulting enzyme.",2001 Jun,RNA. 2001 Jun;7(6):846-58. doi: 10.1017/s135583820101007x.,"['Wong SK', 'Sato S', 'Lazinski DW']",False
11451992,The human but not the Xenopus RNA-editing enzyme ADAR1 has an atypical nuclear localization signal and displays the characteristics of a shuttling protein.,"The RNA-editing enzyme ADAR1 (adenosine deaminase that acts on RNA) is a bona fide nuclear enzyme that has been cloned from several vertebrate species. Putative nuclear localization signals (NLSs) have been identified in the aminoterminal regions of both human and Xenopus ADAR1. Here we show that neither of these predicted NLSs is biologically active. Instead, we could identify a short basic region located upstream of the RNA-binding domains of Xenopus ADAR1 to be necessary and sufficient for nuclear import. In contrast, the homologous region in human ADAR1 does not display NLS activity. Instead, we could map an NLS in human ADAR1 that overlaps with its third double-stranded RNA-binding domain. Interestingly, the NLS activity displayed by this double-stranded RNA-binding domain does not depend on RNA binding, therefore showing a dual function for this domain. Furthermore, nuclear accumulation of human (hs) ADAR1 is transcription dependent and can be stimulated by LMB, an inhibitor of Crm1-dependent nuclear export, indicating that hsADAR1 can move between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Regulated nuclear import and export of hsADAR1 can provide an excellent mechanism to control nuclear concentration of this editing enzyme thereby preventing hyperediting of structured nuclear RNAs.",2001 Jul,Mol Biol Cell. 2001 Jul;12(7):1911-24. doi: 10.1091/mbc.12.7.1911.,"['Eckmann CR', 'Neunteufl A', 'Pfaffstetter L', 'Jantsch MF']",True

11717408,Underediting of glutamate receptor GluR-B mRNA in malignant gliomas.,"In mammals, RNA editing by site-selective adenosine deamination regulates key functional properties of neurotransmitter receptors in the central nervous system. Glutamate receptor subunit B is nearly 100% edited at one position (the Q/R-site), which is essential for normal receptor function. Its significance is apparent from mouse models in which a slightly reduced rate of Q/R-site editing is associated with early onset epilepsy and premature death. Here we report that in tissues from malignant human brain tumors, this editing position of glutamate receptor subunit B is substantially underedited compared with control tissues. We also observe alterations in editing and alternative splicing of serotonin receptor 5-HT(2C) transcripts. These changes correlate with a decrease in enzymatic activity of the editing enzyme adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) 2, as deduced from analysis of ADAR2 self-editing. Our results suggest a role for RNA editing in tumor progression and may provide a molecular model explaining the occurrence of epileptic seizures in association with malignant gliomas.",2001 Dec 4,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2001 Dec 4;98(25):14687-92. doi: 10.1073/pnas.251531398.

11743024,RNAi is antagonized by A-->I hyper-editing.,"RNA interference (RNAi) and adenosine to inosine conversion are both mechanisms that respond to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and have been suggested to have antiviral roles. RNAi involves processing of dsRNA to short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which subsequently mediate degradation of the cognate mRNAs. Deamination of adenosines changes the coding capacity of the RNA, as inosine is decoded as guanosine, and alters the structure because A-U base pairs are replaced by I*U wobble pairs. Here we show that RNAi is inhibited if the triggering dsRNA is first deaminated by ADAR2. Moreover, we show that production of siRNAs is progressively inhibited with increasing deamination and that this is sufficient to explain the inhibition of RNAi upon hyper-editing of dsRNAs.",2001 Dec,EMBO Rep. 2001 Dec;2(12):1107-11. doi: 10.1093/embo-reports/kve244.

10843996,The zab domain of the human RNA editing enzyme ADAR1 recognizes Z-DNA when surrounded by B-DNA.,"The Zab domain of the editing enzyme ADAR1 binds tightly and specifically to Z-DNA stabilized by bromination or supercoiling. A stoichiometric amount of protein has been shown to convert a substrate of suitable sequence to the Z form, as demonstrated by a characteristic change in the CD spectrum of the DNA. Now we show that Zab can bind not only to isolated Z-forming d(CG)(n) sequences but also to d(CG)(n) embedded in B-DNA. The binding of Zab to such sequences results in a complex including Z-DNA, B-DNA, and two B-Z junctions. In this complex, the d(CG)(n) sequence, but not the flanking region, is in the Z conformation. The presence of Z-DNA was detected by cleavage with a Z-DNA specific nuclease, by undermethylation using Z-DNA sensitive SssI methylase, and by circular dichroism. It is possible that Zab binds to B-DNA with low affinity and flips any favorable sequence into Z-DNA, resulting in a high affinity complex. Alternatively, Zab may capture Z-DNA that exists transiently in solution. The binding of Zab to potential as well as established Z-DNA segments suggests that the range of biological substrates might be wider than previously thought.",2000 Sep 1,J Biol Chem. 2000 Sep 1;275(35):26828-33. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M003477200.,"['Kim YG', 'Lowenhaupt K', 'Maas S', 'Herbert A', 'Schwartz T', 'Rich A']",True
11041852,Double-stranded RNA adenosine deaminases ADAR1 and ADAR2 have overlapping specificities.,"Adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADARs) deaminate adenosines to produce inosines within RNAs that are largely double-stranded (ds). Like most dsRNA binding proteins, the enzymes will bind to any dsRNA without apparent sequence specificity. However, once bound, ADARs deaminate certain adenosines more efficiently than others. Most of what is known about the intrinsic deamination specificity of ADARs derives from analyses of Xenopus ADAR1. In addition to ADAR1, mammalian cells have a second ADAR, named ADAR2; the deamination specificity of this enzyme has not been rigorously studied. Here we directly compare the specificity of human ADAR1 and ADAR2. We find that, like ADAR1, ADAR2 has a 5' neighbor preference (A approximately U > C = G), but, unlike ADAR1, also has a 3' neighbor preference (U = G > C = A). Simultaneous analysis of both neighbor preferences reveals that ADAR2 prefers certain trinucleotide sequences (UAU, AAG, UAG, AAU). In addition to characterizing ADAR2 preferences, we analyzed the fraction of adenosines deaminated in a given RNA at complete reaction, or the enzyme's selectivity. We find that ADAR1 and ADAR2 deaminate a given RNA with the same selectivity, and this appears to be dictated by features of the RNA substrate. Finally, we observed that Xenopus and human ADAR1 deaminate the same adenosines on all RNAs tested, emphasizing the similarity of ADAR1 in these two species. Our data add substantially to the understanding of ADAR2 specificity, and aid in efforts to predict which ADAR deaminates a given editing site adenosine in vivo.",2000 Oct 24,Biochemistry. 2000 Oct 24;39(42):12875-84. doi: 10.1021/bi001383g.,"['Lehmann KA', 'Bass BL']",True
11015203,Analysis of the RNA-editing reaction of ADAR2 with structural and fluorescent analogues of the GluR-B R/G editing site.,"ADARs are adenosine deaminases responsible for RNA editing reactions that occur in eukaryotic pre-mRNAs, including the pre-mRNAs of glutamate and serotonin receptors. Here we describe the generation and analysis of synthetic ADAR2 substrates that differ in structure around an RNA editing site. We find that five base pairs of duplex secondary structure 5' to the editing site increase the single turnover rate constant for deamination 17-39-fold when compared to substrates lacking this structure. ADAR2 deaminates an adenosine in the sequence context of a natural editing site >90-fold more rapidly and to a higher yield than an adjacent adenosine in the same RNA structure. This reactivity is minimally dependent on the base pairing partner of the edited nucleotide; adenosine at the editing site in the naturally occurring A.C mismatch is deaminated to approximately the same extent and only 4 times faster than adenosine in an A.U base pair at this site. A steady-state rate analysis at a saturating concentration of the most rapidly processed substrate indicates that product formation is linear with time through at least three turnovers with a slope of 13 +/- 1.5 nM.min(-1) at 30 nM ADAR2 for a k(ss) = 0.43 +/- 0.05 min(-1). In addition, ADAR2 induces a 3.3-fold enhancement in fluorescence intensity and a 14 nm blue shift in the emission maximum of a duplex substrate with 2-aminopurine located at the editing site, consistent with a mechanism whereby ADAR2 flips the reactive nucleotide out of the double helix prior to deamination.",2000 Oct 10,Biochemistry. 2000 Oct 10;39(40):12243-51. doi: 10.1021/bi0011577.,"['Stephens OM', 'Yi-Brunozzi HY', 'Beal PA']",True
11070079,Chimeric double-stranded RNA-specific adenosine deaminase ADAR1 proteins reveal functional selectivity of double-stranded RNA-binding domains from ADAR1 and protein kinase PKR.,"The RNA-specific adenosine deaminase (ADAR1) and the RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) are both interferon-inducible double-stranded (ds) RNA-binding proteins. ADAR1, an RNA editing enzyme that converts adenosine to inosine, possesses three copies of a dsRNA-binding motif (dsRBM). PKR, a regulator of translation, has two copies of the highly conserved dsRBM motif. To assess the functional selectivity of the dsRBM motifs in ADAR1, we constructed and characterized chimeric proteins in which the dsRBMs of ADAR1 were substituted with those of PKR. Recombinant PKR-ADAR1 chimeras retained significant RNA adenosine deaminase activity measured with a synthetic dsRNA substrate when the spacer region between the RNA-binding and catalytic domains of the deaminase was exactly preserved. However, with natural substrates, substitution of the first two dsRBMs of ADAR1 with those from PKR dramatically reduced site-selective editing activity at the R/G and (+)60 sites of the glutamate receptor B subunit pre-RNA and completely abolished editing of the serotonin 2C receptor (5-HT(2C)R) pre-RNA at the A site. Chimeric deaminases possessing only the two dsRBMs from PKR were incapable of editing either glutamate receptor B subunit or 5-HT(2C)R natural sites but edited synthetic dsRNA. Finally, RNA antagonists of PKR significantly inhibited the activity of chimeric PKR-ADAR1 proteins relative to wild-type ADAR1, further demonstrating the functional selectivity of the dsRBM motifs.",2000 Nov 7,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2000 Nov 7;97(23):12541-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.97.23.12541.,"['Liu Y', 'Lei M', 'Samuel CE']",True

We have now identified a new class of ADAR1 transcripts, with alternative 5'-structures and a deduced coding capacity for the approximately 110 kDa protein. Nuclease protection and 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5'-RACE) revealed five major ADAR1 transcriptional start sites that mapped within the previously identified and unusually large (approximately 1.6 kb) exon 2.

Transfection analysis identified a functional promoter within human genomic DNA that mapped to the proximal exon 2 region of the ADAR1 gene. Promoter activity was not affected by IFN.

We have attempted to determine if ADAR deamination specificity occurs because the enzymes bind to targeted regions with higher affinities. To explore this question we studied binding of rat ADAR2 to a region of rat gluR-B pre-mRNA that contains the R/G editing site, and compared a wild-type molecule with one containing mutations that decreased R/G site editing.

10688364,A phylogenetic analysis reveals an unusual sequence conservation within introns involved in RNA editing.,"Adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADARs) are RNA editing enzymes that convert adenosines to inosines within cellular and viral RNAs. Certain glutamate receptor (gluR) pre-mRNAs are substrates for the enzymes in vivo. For example, at the R/G editing site of gluR-B, -C, and -D RNAs, ADARs change an arginine codon (AGA) to a glycine codon (IGA) so that two protein isoforms can be synthesized from a single encoded mRNA; the highly related gluR-A sequence is not edited at this site. To gain insight into what features of an RNA substrate are important for accurate and efficient editing by an ADAR, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of sequences required for editing at the R/G site. We observed highly conserved sequences that were shared by gluR-B, -C, and -D, but absent from gluR-A. Surprisingly, in contrast to results obtained in phylogenetic analyses of tRNA and rRNA, it was the bases in paired, helical regions whose identity was conserved, whereas bases in nonhelical regions varied, but maintained their nonhelical state. We speculate this pattern in part reflects constraints imposed by ADAR's unique specificity and gained support for our hypotheses with mutagenesis studies. Unexpectedly, we observed that some of the gluR introns were conserved beyond the sequences required for editing. The approximately 600-nt intron 13 of gluR-C was particularly remarkable, showing >94% nucleotide identity between human and chicken, organisms estimated to have diverged 310 million years ago.",2000 Feb,RNA. 2000 Feb;6(2):257-69. doi: 10.1017/s1355838200991921.,"['Aruscavage PJ', 'Bass BL']",True
11119696,The AMPAR subunit GluR2: still front and center-stage.,"Abnormal influx of Ca(2+) through AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) is thought to contribute to the neuronal death associated with a number of brain disorders. AMPARs exist as both Ca(2+)-impermeable and Ca(2+)-permeable channels. AMPARs are encoded by four genes designated GluR1 (GluR-A) through GluR4 (GluR-D). The presence of the GluR2 subunit renders heteromeric AMPA receptor assemblies Ca(2+)-impermeable. Molecular diversity of AMPARs under physiological and pathological conditions is generated by differential spatio-temporal patterns of GluR expression, by alternative RNA splicing and editing and by targeting and trafficking of receptor subunits at dendritic spines. The GluR2 gene is under transcriptional control by the RE1 element specific transcription factor, a gene silencing factor which renders it neuron-specific. GluR2 transcripts are edited by ADAR2 (double-stranded RNA-specific editase 1). AMPAR targeting and trafficking to spines are regulated by synaptic activity and are critical to synaptic plasticity. Recent studies involving animal models of transient forebrain ischemia and epilepsy show that GluR2 mRNA and GluR2 subunit expression are downregulated in vulnerable neurons prior to cell death. Ca(2+) imaging and electrical recording from individual pyramidal neurons in hippocampal slices reveal changes in AMPAR functional properties after ischemia. In slices from post-ischemia animals, CA1 neurons with robust action potentials exhibit greatly enhanced AMPA-elicited rises in intracellular Ca(2+). Excitatory postsynaptic currents in post-ischemic CA1 exhibit an enhanced Ca(2+)-dependent component that appears to be mediated by Ca(2+)-permeable AMPARs. These studies provide evidence for Ca(2+) influx through AMPARs in neurons destined to die. To examine whether acute GluR2 downregulation, even in the absence of a neurological insult, can induce neuronal death, we performed knockdown experiments in rats and gerbils with antisense oligonucleotides targeted to GluR2 mRNA. GluR2 antisense oligonucleotide induced neuronal cell death of pyramidal neurons and enhanced pathogenicity of brief ischemic episodes.

Adults lacking dADAR are morphologically wild-type but exhibit extreme behavioral deficits including temperature-sensitive paralysis, locomotor uncoordination, and tremors which increase in severity with age. Neurodegeneration accompanies the increase in phenotypic severity. Surprisingly, dADAR mutants are not short-lived. Thus, A-to-I editing of pre-mRNAs in Drosophila acts predominantly through nervous system targets to affect adult nervous system function, integrity, and behavior.",2000 Aug 18,Cell. 2000 Aug 18;102(4):437-49. doi: 10.1016/s0092-8674(00)00049-0.,"['Palladino MJ', 'Keegan LP', ""O'Connell MA"", 'Reenan RA']",True
10670454,Patterns of developmental expression of the RNA editing enzyme rADAR2.,"To date, two structurally related RNA-editing enzymes with adenosine deaminase activity have been identified in mammalian tissue: ADAR1 and ADAR2 [Bass B. I. et al. (1997) RNA 3, 947-949]. In rodents, ADAR2 undergoes alternative RNA splicing, giving rise to two splice variants that differ by the presence or absence of a 10-amino-acid insert in the carboxy-terminal catalytic domain. However, the physiological significance of the splicing and its regional and developmental regulation are as yet unknown. The present study examined spatial and temporal patterns of ADAR2 gene transcripts within specific neuronal populations of rat brain. The two rodent ADAR2 isoforms were expressed at comparable levels at all ages examined. rADAR2 messenger RNA expression was first detectable in the thalamic nuclei formation at embryonic day E19. The rADAR2b insert and rADAR2a splice probes produced images similar to that of the rADAR2 pan probe. At birth, rADAR2a messenger RNA splice variants were abundantly expressed in the thalamic nuclei. No signal for any probe was detectable in other brain regions, including neocortex, hippocampus, striatum and cerebellum at this stage of development. During the first week of postnatal life, rADAR2 messenger RNA expression (detected with the pan probe) increased gradually in several brain regions, with low expression detected at postnatal day P7 in the olfactory bulb, inferior colliculus, and within the pyramidal and granule cell layers of the hippocampus. Hybridization patterns of the rADAR2a variant probe reached peak expression at about the second week of life, while peak expression of the rADAR2b probe was reached at about the third week of life. At the end of the first week of life (P7), expression of both splice variants was strongest in the thalamic nuclei. By P14, rADAR2 messenger RNA expression was more consolidated in the deeper structures, including the thalamic nuclei and the granule cell layer of the cerebellum. By P21, maximal levels of rADARb expression were observed in the thalamic nuclei, inferior colliculus, cerebellum and pontine nuclei. In the adult, rADAR2 messenger RNA expression was of highest intensity in the thalamic nuclei, with high levels of expression in the olfactory bulb, inferior colliculus, cerebellum and pontine nuclei. At the level of the hippocampus, positive labelling was restricted to the CA3 region of the Ammon's horn and the dentate gyrus, with weak signals in the CA1 subfield. rADAR2 pan expression was at near background levels throughout the neocortex and caudate putamen. In summary, our study shows that ADAR2 messenger RNA expression is regulated in a cell-specific manner throughout development. At early ages, ADAR2 messenger RNA is expressed only within (and restricted to) the thalamic nuclei. By the third postnatal week, expression of the editase enzyme is more widely distributed throughout the olfactory bulb, CA3 and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, thalamus, inferior colliculus and the molecular cell layer of the cerebellum. ADAR2 is thought to act at specific nucleotide positions in primary transcripts encoding glutamate receptor subunits, thereby altering gating and ionic permeability properties of AMPA- and kainate-activated channels. ADAR2 also acts at pre-messenger RNA encoding the serotonin 5HT-2C receptor to alter G-protein coupling. Thus, RNA editing may be an important mechanism for fine-tuning of the physiological and pharmacological properties of transmitter receptors of the central nervous system.",2000,Neuroscience. 2000;95(3):869-79. doi: 10.1016/s0306-4522(99)00431-5.,"['Paupard M-C', ""O'Connell MA"", 'Gerber AP', 'Zukin RS']",True

Both wild-type Z alpha and a C125S mutant show a mean dissociation constant of 30 nM as measured by surface plasmon resonance and analytical ultracentrifugation.

10331393,Regulation of alternative splicing by RNA editing.,"The enzyme ADAR2 is a double-stranded RNA-specific adenosine deaminase which is involved in the editing of mammalian messenger RNAs by the site-specific conversion of adenosine to inosine. Here we identify several rat ADAR2 mRNAs produced as a result of two distinct alternative splicing events. One such splicing event uses a proximal 3' acceptor site, adding 47 nucleotides to the ADAR2 coding region, changing the predicted reading frame of the mature ADAR2 transcript. Nucleotide-sequence analysis of ADAR2 genomic DNA revealed the presence of adenosine-adenosine (AA) and adenosine-guanosine (AG) dinucleotides at these proximal and distal alternative 3' acceptor sites, respectively. Use of the proximal 3' acceptor depends upon the ability of ADAR2 to edit its own pre-mRNA, converting the intronic AA to an adenosine-inosine (AI) dinucleotide which effectively mimics the highly conserved AG sequence normally found at 3' splice junctions. Our observations indicate that RNA editing can serve as a mechanism for regulating alternative splicing and they suggest a novel strategy by which ADAR2 can modulate its own expression.",1999 May 6,Nature. 1999 May 6;399(6731):75-80. doi: 10.1038/19992.,"['Rueter SM', 'Dawson TR', 'Emeson RB']",True

In the 12 years since the discovery of ADARs only a few natural substrates have been identified. These substrates were found by chance, when genomically encoded adenosines were identified as guanosines in cDNAs. To advance our understanding of the biological roles of ADARs, we developed a method for systematically identifying ADAR substrates. In our first application of the method, we identified five additional substrates in Caenorhabditis elegans. Four of those substrates are mRNAs edited in untranslated regions, and one is a noncoding RNA edited throughout its length. The edited regions are predicted to form long hairpin structures, and one of the RNAs encodes POP-1, a protein involved in cell fate decisions.",1999 May 25,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1999 May 25;96(11):6048-53. doi: 10.1073/pnas.96.11.6048.,"['Morse DP', 'Bass BL']",True

We have now isolated and characterized human genomic clones that contain the promoter region required for transcription of the ADAR1 gene. Rapid amplification of cDNA 5'-ends (5'-RACE) identified additional upstream exon 1 sequence that was localized on P1-phage and lambda-phage genomic clones by Southern gel-blot analysis and sequence analysis. A Northern gel-blot analysis using a probe corresponding to the 5'-RACE exon 1 sequence and adjacent exon 2 sequence detected a major RNA transcript of approximately 6.7kb that was IFN-inducible in human amnion U cells. Transient transfection assays, using chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) as the reporter in constructs possessing various 5'-flanking fragments of the ADAR1 gene, led to the identification of a functional TATA-less promoter that directed IFN-inducible transcription of CAT. Sequence determination and deletion analysis of the promoter region revealed a consensus copy of the IFN-Stimulated Response Element (ISRE) involved in IFN inducibility that was flanked by a Kinase Conserved Sequence (KCS)-like element previously found to be unique to the human and mouse PKR gene promoters.

Their main physiological substrates are pre-mRNAs encoding subunits of ionotropic glutamate receptors or serotonin receptors in the brain. ADAR1 and ADAR2 have similar sequence features, including double-stranded RNA binding domains (dsRBDs) and a deaminase domain.

Tad1p is related to ADAR1 and ADAR2 throughout its sequence but lacks dsRBDs. Tad1p could be the ancestor of ADAR1 and ADAR2.

Measurements of 5-HT2CR pre-mRNA editing in vitro revealed site-specific deamination catalyzed by ADAR1. Three splice site variants, ADAR1-a, -b, and -c, all efficiently edited the A site of 5-HT2CR pre-mRNA, but the D site did not serve as an efficient substrate for any of the ADAR1 variants. Mutational analysis of the three double-stranded (ds) RNA binding motifs present in ADAR1 revealed a different relative importance of the individual dsRNA binding motifs for deamination of the A site of 5-HT2CR and synthetic dsRNA substrates. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses demonstrated that the 5-HT2CR pre-mRNA was most highly expressed in the choroid plexus of rat brain.

This motif binds to alternating dC-dG sequences stabilized in the Z-conformation by means of bromination or supercoiling, but not to B-DNA. Zalpha is part of the N-terminal region of double-stranded RNA adenosine deaminase (ADAR1), a candidate enzyme for nuclear pre-mRNA editing in mammals. Zalpha is conserved in ADAR1 from many species; in each case, there is a second similar motif, Zbeta, separated from Zalpha by a more divergent linker. To investigate the structure-function relationship of Zalpha, its domain structure was studied by limited proteolysis. Proteolytic profiles indicated that Zalpha is part of a domain, Zab, of 229 amino acids (residues 133-361 in human ADAR1). This domain contains both Zalpha and Zbeta as well as a tandem repeat of a 49-amino acid linker module. Prolonged proteolysis revealed a minimal core domain of 77 amino acids (positions 133-209), containing only Zalpha, which is sufficient to bind left-handed Z-DNA; however, the substrate binding is strikingly different from that of Zab. The second motif, Zbeta, retains its structural integrity only in the context of Zab and does not bind Z-DNA as a separate entity.

We previously demonstrated that a cytoplasmic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) binding factor(s), cyto-dsRBP, protects microinjected dsRNA from the ADAR released at maturation. Here we describe experiments to determine whether an endogenous dsRNA, the duplex formed between sense and antisense transcripts of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), is protected in a similar manner. Consistent with the presence of cyto-dsRBP, we observed that the majority of bFGF RNA was not deaminated, before or after maturation. However, a minor fraction of the bFGF RNA was deaminated whether the RNA was isolated from stage VI oocytes or matured oocytes. Since ADAR activity is in the nucleus in stage VI oocytes, our results suggest that a fraction of the bFGF RNAs are hybridized in the nucleus and are ADAR substrates.

Few candidate substrates for ADAR1 editing are known at this point and it is not known how substrate recognition is achieved. In some cases editing sites are defined by basepaired regions formed between intronic and exonic sequences, suggesting that the enzyme might function cotranscriptionally. We have isolated two variants of Xenopus laevis ADAR1 for which no editing substrates are currently known. We demonstrate that both variants of the enzyme are associated with transcriptionally active chromosome loops suggesting that the enzyme acts cotranscriptionally. The widespread distribution of the protein along the entire chromosome indicates that ADAR1 associates with the RNP matrix in a substrate-independent manner. Inhibition of splicing, another cotranscriptional process, does not affect the chromosomal localization of ADAR1. Furthermore, we can show that the enzyme is dramatically enriched on a special RNA-containing loop that seems transcriptionally silent. Detailed analysis of this loop suggests that it might represent a site of ADAR1 storage or a site where active RNA editing is taking place.

Three alternative splice-site variants of ADAR1 (ADAR1-a, -b, and -c) occur that possess functionally distinct double-stranded RNA-binding motifs as measured with synthetic double-stranded RNA substrates. The pre-mRNA transcript encoding the B subunit of glutamate receptor (GluR-B) has two functionally important editing sites (Q/R and R/G sites) that undergo selective A-to-I conversions.

ADAR1-b and -c showed higher editing activity than ADAR1-a for the R/G site, whereas the intron +60 site was edited with comparable efficiency by all three ADAR1 splice variants. Mutational analysis revealed that the functional importance of each of the three RNA-binding motifs of ADAR1 varied with the specific target editing site in GluR-B RNA.

10438602,The importance of internal loops within RNA substrates of ADAR1.,"Adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADARs) are a family of RNA editing enzymes that convert adenosines to inosines within double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Although ADARs deaminate perfectly base-paired dsRNA promiscuously, deamination is limited to a few, selected adenosines within dsRNA containing mismatches, bulges and internal loops. As a first step in understanding how RNA structural features promote selectivity, we investigated the role of internal loops within ADAR substrates. We observed that a dsRNA helix is deaminated at the same sites whether it exists as a free molecule or is flanked by internal loops. Thus, internal loops delineate helix ends for ADAR1. Since ADAR1 deaminates short RNAs at fewer adenosines than long RNAs, loops decrease the number of deaminations within an RNA by dividing a long RNA into shorter substrates. For a series of symmetric internal loops related in sequence, larger loops (>/=six nucleotides) acted as helix ends, whereas smaller loops (</=four nucleotides) did not. Our work provides the first information about how secondary structure within ADAR substrates dictates selectivity, and suggests a rational approach for delineating minimal substrates for RNAs deaminated by ADARs in vivo.",1999 Aug 6,J Mol Biol. 1999 Aug 6;291(1):1-13. doi: 10.1006/jmbi.1999.2914.,"['Lehmann KA', 'Bass BL']",True

We have now identified alternative exon 1 structures of human ADAR1 transcripts that initiate from unique promoters, one constitutively expressed and the other IFN inducible. Cloning and sequence analyses of 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) cDNAs from human placenta established a linkage between exon 2 of ADAR1 and two alternative exon 1 structures, designated herein as exon 1A and exon 1B. Analysis of RNA isolated from untreated and IFN-treated human amnion cells demonstrated that exon 1B-exon 2 transcripts were synthesized in the absence of IFN and were not significantly altered in amount by IFN treatment. By contrast, exon 1A-exon 2 transcripts were IFN inducible. Transient transfection analysis with reporter constructs led to the identification of two functional promoters, designated PC and PI. Exon 1B transcripts were initiated from the PC promoter whose activity in transient transfection reporter assays was not increased by IFN treatment. The 107-nt exon 1B mapped 14.5 kb upstream of exon 2. The 201-nt exon 1A that mapped 5.4 kb upstream of exon 2 was initiated from the interferon-inducible PI promoter. These results suggest that two promoters, one IFN inducible and the other not, initiate transcription of the ADAR1 gene, and that alternative splicing of unique exon 1 structures to a common exon 2 junction generates RNA transcripts with the deduced coding capacity for either the constitutively expressed approximately 110-kDa ADAR1 protein (exon 1B) or the interferon-induced approximately 150-kDa ADAR1 protein (exon 1A).",1999 Apr 13,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1999 Apr 13;96(8):4621-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.96.8.4621.,"['George CX', 'Samuel CE']",True
10710708,Left-handed Z-DNA: structure and function.,"Z-DNA is a high energy conformer of B-DNA that forms in vivo during transcription as a result of torsional strain generated by a moving polymerase. An understanding of the biological role of Z-DNA has advanced with the discovery that the RNA editing enzyme double-stranded RNA adenosine deaminase type I (ADAR1) has motifs specific for the Z-DNA conformation. Editing by ADAR1 requires a double-stranded RNA substrate. In the cases known, the substrate is formed by folding an intron back onto the exon that is targeted for modification. The use of introns to direct processing of exons requires that editing occurs before splicing. Recognition of Z-DNA by ADAR1 may allow editing of nascent transcripts to be initiated immediately after transcription, ensuring that editing and splicing are performed in the correct sequence. Structural characterization of the Z-DNA binding domain indicates that it belongs to the winged helix-turn-helix class of proteins and is similar to the globular domain of histone-H5.",1999,Genetica. 1999;106(1-2):37-47. doi: 10.1023/a:1003768526018.,"['Herbert A', 'Rich A']",True

9636358,Adenovirus VAI RNA antagonizes the RNA-editing activity of the ADAR adenosine deaminase.,"The virus-associated VAI RNA of adenovirus is a small highly structured RNA that is required for the efficient translation of cellular and viral mRNAs at late times after infection. VAI RNA antagonizes the activation of the interferon-inducible RNA-dependent protein kinase, PKR, an important regulator of translation. The RNA-specific adenosine deaminase, ADAR, is an interferon-inducible RNA-editing enzyme that catalyzes the site-selective C-6 deamination of adenosine to inosine. ADAR possesses three copies of the highly conserved RNA-binding motif (dsRBM) that are similar to the two copies found in PKR, the enzyme in which the prototype dsRBM motif was discovered. We have examined the effect of VAI RNA on ADAR function. VAI RNA impairs the activity of ADAR deaminase. This inhibition can be observed in extracts prepared from interferon-treated human cells and from monkey COS cells in which wild-type recombinant ADAR was expressed. Analysis of wild-type and mutant forms of VA RNA suggests that the central domain is important in the antagonism of ADAR activity. These results suggest that VAI RNA may modulate viral and cellular gene expression by modulating RNA editing as well as mRNA translation.",1998 Jun 5,Virology. 1998 Jun 5;245(2):188-96. doi: 10.1006/viro.1998.9162.,"['Lei M', 'Liu Y', 'Samuel CE']",True

We report that IMP is present in mRNA at tissue-specific levels that correlate with the levels of ADAR mRNA expression.

Analysis of mammalian ADAR1 identified the third dsRBD in this enzyme as most important for RNA binding. Here we analyzed the three dsRBDs of Xenopus ADAR1 for their in vitro RNA-binding behavior using two different assays. Northwestern assays identified the second dsRBD in the Xenopus protein as most important for RNA binding while in-solution assays demonstrated the importance of the third dsRBD for RNA binding.

The activity of purified recombinant Tad1p depends on the conformation of its tRNA substrate and the enzyme was found to be inactive on all other types of RNA tested. Mutant strains in which the TAD1 gene is disrupted are viable but lack Tad1p enzyme activity and their tRNAAla is not modified at position A37. Transformation of the mutant cells with the TAD1 gene restored enzyme activity. Tad1p has significant sequence similarity with the mammalian editing enzymes which act on specific precursor-mRNAs and on long double-stranded RNA.

9671809,The Zalpha domain from human ADAR1 binds to the Z-DNA conformer of many different sequences.,"Z-DNA, the left-handed conformer of DNA, is stabilized by the negative supercoiling generated during the movement of an RNA polymerase through a gene. Recently, we have shown that the editing enzyme ADAR1 (double-stranded RNA adenosine deaminase, type 1) has two Z-DNA binding motifs, Zalpha and Zbeta, the function of which is currently unknown. Here we show that a peptide containing the Zalpha motif binds with high affinity to Z-DNA as a dimer, that the binding site is no larger than 6 bp and that the Zalpha domain can flip a range of sequences, including d(TA)3, into the Z-DNAconformation. Evidence is also presented to show that Zalpha and Zbeta interact to form a functional DNA binding site. Studies with atomic force microscopy reveal that binding of Zalpha to supercoiled plasmids is associated with relaxation of the plasmid. Pronounced kinking of DNA is observed, and appears to be induced by binding of Zalpha. The results reported here support a model where the Z-DNA binding motifs target ADAR1 to regions of negative supercoiling in actively transcribing genes. In this situation, binding by Zalpha would be dependent upon the local level of negative superhelicity rather than the presence of any particular sequence.",1998 Aug 1,Nucleic Acids Res. 1998 Aug 1;26(15):3486-93. doi: 10.1093/nar/26.15.3486.,"['Herbert A', 'Schade M', 'Lowenhaupt K', 'Alfken J', 'Schwartz T', 'Shlyakhtenko LS', 'Lyubchenko YL', 'Rich A']",True
9528763,Hepatitis delta virus RNA editing is highly specific for the amber/W site and is suppressed by hepatitis delta antigen.,"RNA editing at adenosine 1012 (amber/W site) in the antigenomic RNA of hepatitis delta virus (HDV) allows two essential forms of the viral protein, hepatitis delta antigen (HDAg), to be synthesized from a single open reading frame. Editing at the amber/W site is thought to be catalyzed by one of the cellular enzymes known as adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADARs). In vitro, the enzymes ADAR1 and ADAR2 deaminate adenosines within many different sequences of base-paired RNA. Since promiscuous deamination could compromise the viability of HDV, we wondered if additional deamination events occurred within the highly base paired HDV RNA. By sequencing cDNAs derived from HDV RNA from transfected Huh-7 cells, we determined that the RNA was not extensively modified at other adenosines. Approximately 0.16 to 0.32 adenosines were modified per antigenome during 6 to 13 days posttransfection. Interestingly, all observed non-amber/W adenosine modifications, which occurred mostly at positions that are highly conserved among naturally occurring HDV isolates, were found in RNAs that were also modified at the amber/W site. Such coordinate modification likely limits potential deleterious effects of promiscuous editing. Neither viral replication nor HDAg was required for the highly specific editing observed in cells. However, HDAg was found to suppress editing at the amber/W site when expressed at levels similar to those found during HDV replication. These data suggest HDAg may regulate amber/W site editing during virus replication.",1998 Apr,Mol Cell Biol. 1998 Apr;18(4):1919-26. doi: 10.1128/MCB.18.4.1919.,"['Polson AG', 'Ley HL 3rd', 'Bass BL', 'Casey JL']",True

The characteristics of the IFN-inducing capacity of reovirus, and the antiviral actions of IFN exerted against reovirus, are dependent upon the specific combination of reovirus strain, host cell line, and IFN type. Responses, both IFN induction and IFN action, differ quantitatively if not qualitatively and are dependent upon the virus, cell, and IFN combination. Stable natural dsRNA, identified as the form of nucleic acid that constitutes the reovirus genome, is centrally involved in the function of at least three IFN-induced enzymes. Protein phosphorylation by PKR, RNA editing by the ADAR adenosine deaminase, and RNA degradation by the 2',5'-oligoA pathway all involve dsRNA either as an effector or as a substrate. Considerable evidence implicates PKR as a particularly important contributor to the IFN-induced antiviral state displayed at the level of the single virus-infected cell, where the translation of viral mRNA is often observed to be inhibited following treatment with IFN-alpha/beta. In the whole animal infected with reovirus, elevated cellular immune responses mediated by enhanced expression of MHC class I and class II antigens induced by IFN-alpha/beta or IFN-gamma may contribute significantly to the overall antiviral response.",1998,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol. 1998;233(Pt 2):125-45. doi: 10.1007/978-3-642-72095-6_7.,['Samuel CE'],True

9237992,"A Z-DNA binding domain present in the human editing enzyme, double-stranded RNA adenosine deaminase.","Editing of RNA changes the read-out of information from DNA by altering the nucleotide sequence of a transcript. One type of RNA editing found in all metazoans uses double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) as a substrate and results in the deamination of adenosine to give inosine, which is translated as guanosine. Editing thus allows variant proteins to be produced from a single pre-mRNA. A mechanism by which dsRNA substrates form is through pairing of intronic and exonic sequences before the removal of noncoding sequences by splicing. Here we report that the RNA editing enzyme, human dsRNA adenosine deaminase (DRADA1, or ADAR1) contains a domain (Zalpha) that binds specifically to the left-handed Z-DNA conformation with high affinity (KD = 4 nM). As formation of Z-DNA in vivo occurs 5' to, or behind, a moving RNA polymerase during transcription, recognition of Z-DNA by DRADA1 provides a plausible mechanism by which DRADA1 can be targeted to a nascent RNA so that editing occurs before splicing.

After pretreatment with different concentrations of N-ethoxycarbonyl-1,2-dihydroquinoline, which irreversibly inactivates alpha 2D-AR, the portion of alpha 2D-ARs remaining active (q) was estimated from EPI-stimulated [35S]GTP gamma S binding. This function-derived estimate was close to the actual remaining number of receptors, as determined in saturation-binding studies using the selective alpha 2-AR antagonist [3H]rauwolscine in the same membranes. The agonist dissociation constant (KA) derived from EPI-stimulated [35S]GTP gamma S binding via Furchgott analysis was similar to the EC50 of EPI in the same assay, but 40-fold lower than its Ki measured from EPI competition for [3H]rauwolscine-binding sites in the presence of GTP gamma S and Na+. The occupancy-response relationship, calculated using Ki rather than KA, was markedly nonlinear, consistent with the high expression of alpha 2D-AR in these membranes. A nonlinear occupancy-response relationship was more directly confirmed by measuring the maximal level (i.e., full occupancy level) of G protein activation at graded densities of alpha AD-AR after N-ethoxycarbonyl-1,2-dihydroquinoline treatment. Determination of the number of G-proteins activated per receptor yielded lower values at higher receptor densities, indicating that overexpression of receptors can reduce their efficiency.

METHODS: Isolated working rat hearts were subjected to 30 min ischaemia and 30 min reperfusion. Control hearts were compared to hearts preconditioned with 10 min hypoxia. Left ventricular function and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release were measured in each group. Ascorbate dependent (ADAR) and thiol dependent (TDAR) components of the endogenous myocardial antioxidant reserve were assessed using electron spin resonance spectroscopy. RESULTS: a Hypoxic preconditioning had no effect on left ventricular function after 10 min reoxygenation. During reperfusion, the hypoxically preconditioned hearts had a significantly increased survival rate, aortic flow, developed pressure, and dP/dtmax, and a reduced lactate dehydrogenase release, compared to non-preconditioned controls (P < 0.05). Preconditioned hearts also had significantly higher preservation of baseline ADAR (79%) and TDAR (96%) compared with control hearts, (70%) and (77%), respectively (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Hypoxic preconditioning enhances functional recovery and reduces cell necrosis following global ischaemia in the working rat heart.

24501781,"Leukodystrophy Overview – RETIRED CHAPTER, FOR HISTORICAL REFERENCE ONLY.","NOTE: THIS PUBLICATION HAS BEEN RETIRED. THIS ARCHIVAL VERSION IS FOR HISTORICAL REFERENCE ONLY, AND THE INFORMATION MAY BE OUT OF DATE. CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Leukodystrophies are heritable myelin disorders affecting the white matter of the central nervous system with or without peripheral nervous system myelin involvement. Involvement of the white matter tracts almost universally leads to motor involvement that manifests as hypotonia in early childhood and progresses to spasticity over time. This may lead to variable motor impairment, from mild spastic diplegia to severe spastic quadriplegia that limits purposeful movement. In addition, motor dysfunction is likely to significantly impair vital functions including swallowing, chewing, and (in some cases) respiration. Other findings that vary by disorder include extrapyramidal movement disorders (e.g., dystonia and/or dyskinesias), ataxia, seizures, and delay in cognitive development or change in cognitive function over time. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: Establishing the specific leukodystrophy present in a given individual usually involves: Obtaining a medical history and detailed family history. Performing a physical examination and neurologic examination. Review of brain MRI findings: T(2)-weighted hyperintensity in the white matter is the MRI finding required for diagnosis of a leukodystrophy. T(1)-weighted signal may be variable: iso- or hyperintense T(1)-weighted signal is consistent with a hypomyelinating leukodystrophy; hypointense T(1)-weighted signal is consistent with a demyelinating leukodystrophy. Performing specialized laboratory testing, often including molecular genetic testing (either stepwise single-gene testing or use of a multigene panel targeted to the leukodystrophies). GENETIC COUNSELING: Leukodystrophies with an identified genetic cause may be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, an autosomal recessive manner, or an X-linked recessive manner. Genetic counseling regarding risk to family members depends on accurate diagnosis, determination of the mode of inheritance in each family, and results of molecular genetic testing. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible for some types of leukodystrophy if the pathogenic variant(s) in the family are known. Many leukodystrophies are still without an identified genetic cause; once a genetic cause is identified, other inheritance patterns may emerge. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is symptomatic and ideally occurs in a multidisciplinary setting by specialists experienced in the care of persons with a leukodystrophy. Pharmacologic agents are used to manage muscle tone and block neuronal signaling to muscle (chemodenervation). Intensive physical therapy is used to improve mobility and function. Pharmacologic treatment of dystonia and dyskinesias may result in significant functional improvement. Treatment of ataxia, seizures, and cognitive issues is provided in the usual manner, depending on the needs of the individual. Prevention of primary manifestations: In a few leukodystrophies primary disease manifestations can be prevented by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or bone marrow transplantation (BMT) early in the disease course. Surveillance: Routine assessment of growth and nutritional status; physical examination and/or serial x-rays of the hips and spine to monitor for orthopedic complications; and routine history regarding signs and symptoms of seizures. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Mild head injuries and infection as these may exacerbate disease manifestations. Evaluation of relatives at risk: When primary prevention of a leukodystrophy is possible (e.g., by HSCT or BMT), it is appropriate to offer testing to asymptomatic at-risk relatives who would benefit from early diagnosis and consideration of early treatment.",1993,,"['Vanderver A', 'Tonduti D', 'Schiffmann R', 'Schmidt J', 'van der Knaap MS']",True

Over time, as many as 40% develop chilblain skin lesions on the fingers, toes, and ears.

DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of AGS is established in a proband with typical clinical findings and characteristic abnormalities on cranial CT (calcification of the basal ganglia and white matter) and MRI (leukodystrophic changes); AND/OR by identification of one of the following: Biallelic pathogenic variants in ADAR, RNASEH2A, RNASEH2B, RNASEH2C, SAMHD1, or TREX1. Specific heterozygous autosomal dominant pathogenic variants in TREX1 and ADAR. A variety of heterozygous autosomal dominant pathogenic variants in IFIH1. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Chest physiotherapy and treatment of respiratory complications; attention to diet and feeding methods to assure adequate caloric intake and avoid aspiration; management of seizures using standard protocols. Surveillance: Monitoring for signs of diabetes insipidus in the neonatal period; repeat ophthalmologic examinations at least for the first few years of life to evaluate for evidence of glaucoma; monitoring for evidence of scoliosis, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and hypothyroidism. GENETIC COUNSELING: AGS is most frequently inherited in an autosomal recessive manner; in a few instances the disease can result from specific de novo or inherited autosomal dominant pathogenic variants in ADAR or TREX1, and a variety of heterozygous autosomal dominant pathogenic variants in IFIH1. At conception, each sib of an affected individual with autosomal recessive AGS has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Individuals with AGS do not typically reproduce. Once the pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk relatives, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk for AGS, and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",1993,,['Crow YJ'],True

18588159,Hydrodynamics and mass transfer in Aspergillus niger fermentations in bubble column and loop bioreactors.,"The influence of Aspergillus niger broth rheology, bioreactor geometry, and superficial gas velocity on the volumetric liquid phase oxygen transfer coefficient (k(L)a(L)), riser gas holdup (epsilon(GR)), and circulating liquid velocity (u(LR)) was studied in a bubble column (BC) and two external-circulation-loop airlift (ECLAL) bioreactors. The results are compared to those of previous studies on homogeneous fluids and in particular with a recent study on non-Newtonian carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) solutions conducted in the same contactors used for the A. niger fermentations. As expected from the CMC-based studies, in the heterogeneous broths of A. niger epsilon(GR), k(L)a(L), and u(LR) decreased with increasing broth apparent viscosity; epsilon(GR) and k(L)a(L) decreased with increasing downcomer-to-riser cross-sectional area ratio, A(d)/A(r), whereas u(LR) increased with increasing A(d)/A(r). Gas holdup data in the airlift fermentations of A. niger were well predicted by the CMC-based correlation. However, the CMC-based correlations produced conservative estimations of k(L)a(L) and overestimates of u(LR) compared to the observed values in the A. niger broths.",1989 Sep,Biotechnol Bioeng. 1989 Sep;34(6):731-40. doi: 10.1002/bit.260340602.,"['Allen DG', 'Robinson CW']",False
2689170,Type I procollagen C-proteinase from mouse fibroblasts. Purification and demonstration of a 55-kDa enhancer glycoprotein.,"The enzyme procollagen C-proteinase removes the carboxy-terminal propeptide from procollagen. In the present study we describe an improved procedure for the purification of this enzyme. From the medium of cultured mouse fibroblasts, consisting of ammonium sulfate precipitation, gel filtration and affinity chromatography on a lysyl-Sepharose column, followed by chromatography on a column of Sepharose coupled to the carboxy-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen (PP-Sepharose). This procedure yielded a practically homogeneous, 18,500-fold-purified enzyme preparation and the molecular mass of the purified C-proteinase as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was 80 kDa. The lysyl-Sepharose step separated the enzyme from the majority of the contaminating proteins, including a 55-kDa protein which was further purified by PP-Sepharose chromatography and identified as an additional form of the 36-kDa and 34-kDa procollagen C-proteinase enhancer proteins described before [Adar et al. (1986) Collagen Relat. Res. 6,267-277]. It enhanced the C-proteinase activity, bound to the carboxyl propeptide of type I procollagen, cross-reacted immunologically with the 36-kDa as well as the 34-kDa enhancer proteins, and in common with the latter proteins, it was glycosylated. In the course of PP-Sepharose chromatography, a large proportion of the 55-kDa protein disappeared with the concomitant appearance of the smaller enhancer proteins. All these findings suggest that the 55-kDa protein is a precursor of the low molecular mass enhancer proteins. Also suggested from this study is that lysyl-Sepharose chromatography is a highly beneficial purification step which may find use in the purification of the C-proteinase from other sources as well.",1989 Dec 8,Eur J Biochem. 1989 Dec 8;186(1-2):115-21. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1989.tb15184.x.,"['Kessler E', 'Adar R']",False
18584751,External-circulation-loop airlift bioreactors: study of the liquid circulating velocity in highly viscous non-Newtonian liquids.,"In order to obtain further information on the behavior and optimal design of external-circulation-loop airlift (ECL-AL) bioreactors, the liquid circulating velocity, gas holdup and average bubble diameter in the downcomer were studied using highly viscous pseudoplastic solutions of various types of CMC. A few comparative measurements also were made using a viscous Newtonian aqueous sucrose solution. For the liquid velocity measurements, an ultrasonic flow meter (Doppler frequency shift principle) was applied for the first time to the gas/non-Newtonian liquid dispersion in downward flow and satisfactory results were obtained. For viscous liquids, the circulating liquid velocity in the riser section of an ECL-AL (u(LR)) is shown to be dependent mainly on the downcomer-to-riser cross-sectional area ratio (A(d)/A(r)), the effective viscosity (eta(eff)) and the gas superficial velocity (u(GR)) as described by the following equation uLR = 0.23uGR0.32 (Ad /Ar)0.97 eta(eff)- 0.39. The circulating liquid velocity exerts opposing effects on the mass transfer and liquid-phase mixing performances of ECL-AL fermentors. Therefore, it is proposed that the optimum operating conditions for a given fermentation may be best achieved by means of independently regulating the circulating liquid velocity.",1988 Jul 20,Biotechnol Bioeng. 1988 Jul 20;32(3):301-12. doi: 10.1002/bit.260320307.,"['Popović M', 'Robinson CW']",False
18553682,Gas holdup and overall volumetric oxygen transfer coefficient in airlift contactors.,"The two major types of airlift contactors, concentric-tube and external-loop, were investigated for their gas holdup (riser and downcomer) and overall mass transfer characteristics. Results obtained in batch charges of tap water and 0.15 kmol/m(3) NaCl solution are reported for external-loop airlift contactors having downcomer-to-riser cross-sectional area ratios, A(d)/A(r), ranging from 0.11 <or= A(d)/A(r) <or= 0.69 and for concentric-tube types in the range 0.13 <or= A(d)/A(r) <or= 0.56.The results are compared and contrasted for the two types of airlift contactors and also with corresponding results obtained in a bubble column (A(d)/A(r) = 0). Both the riser gas holdup, (epsilon(G))(r), and the overall volumetric mass transfer coefficient, (K(L)a(D))(T), were found to increase with increasing gas superficial velocity and the corresponding specific gassing power input, (P(G)/V(D))(T). However, at a specified power input both (epsilon(G))(r) and (K(L)a(D))(T) decreased with increasing A(d)/A(r) due to a resultant increase in circulating liquid velocity. Unifying generalized correlations for both types of airlift contactors are given for both (epsilon(G))(r) and (K(L)a(D))(T). These correlations are expected to be applicable as well to continuous-liquid flow bubble columns at comparable liquid velocities.",1985 Mar,Biotechnol Bioeng. 1985 Mar;27(3):369-81. doi: 10.1002/bit.260270323.,"['Bello RA', 'Robinson CW', 'Moo-Young M']",False

A histological study shows that the embryos obtained could come from the oosphere or the antipodals. Gynogenesis using male fertile plants gives nearly two haploid plants for 1000 ovules cultured: in this case, the problem is to avoid plating fertilized ovules. The gynogenetic plants obtained display an endopolyploidy phenomenon at the root meristem level while their shoot meristem remains haploid.Colchicine doubling during in vitro vegetative propagation of buds has been carried out successfully.",1985 Dec,Plant Cell Rep. 1985 Dec;4(6):300-3. doi: 10.1007/BF00269883.,"['Bossoutrot D', 'Hosemans D']",False
24254069,Effect of the 1B/1R translocation on anther culture ability in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.).,"Using two varieties, their reciprocal hybrids, F8 lines and doubled haploids, results confirmed that three genetic components are involved in wheat anther culture ability, viz embryo induction frequency, regeneration ability and the frequency of albinism. In these experiments, no significant maternal effects were noticed. For embryo yields, transgressive lines were obtained from hybrids between distant genotypes. Regeneration of green plants depended upon two independent traits: regeneration ability and the frequency of albinos. F8 lines and two doubled haploids equaled the 50% regeneration rate of the hybrids, but they only regenerated green plants. Based upon cytological examination and gliadin patterns, it is suggested that genes favoring regeneration ability could be linked to the 1BL-1RS translocated chromosome from Aurora.",1985 Dec,Plant Cell Rep. 1985 Dec;4(6):307-10. doi: 10.1007/BF00269885.,"['Henry Y', 'de Buyser J']",False

24463,"Raman spectra of heme a, cytochrome oxidase-ligand complexes, and alkaline denatured oxidase.","We report 441.6 nm excitation resonance Raman spectra of oxidized and reduced monomeric heme a-imidazole, cytochrome oxidase-exogenous ligand complexes in various redox states, and alkaline denatured oxidase. These data show that, in reduced oxidase, the cytochrome a3 Raman spectrum has bands at 215, 364, 1230, and 1670 cm-1 not observed in the cytochrome a spectrum. The appearance of these bands in the reduced cytochrome a3 spectrum is due to interactions between the heme a of cytochrome a3 and its protein environment and not to intrinsic properties of heme a. These interactions are pH sensitive and strongly influence the vibrational spectra of both heme a groups. We assign the 1670-cm-1 band to the heme a formyl substituent and propose that the intensity of the 1670 cm-1 is high for reduced cytochrome a3 because the C==O lies in the porphyrin plane and is very weak for oxidized and reduced cytochrome a, oxidized cytochrome a3, and oxidized and reduced heme a-imidazole because the C==O lies out of the plane. We suggest that movement of the C==O in and out of the plane explains the ligand induced spectral shift in the optical absorption spectrum of reduced cytochrome a3. Finally, we confirm the observation of Adar & Yonetani (private communication) that, under laser illumination, resting oxidase is photoreactive.",1978 Mar 7,Biochemistry. 1978 Mar 7;17(5):800-6. doi: 10.1021/bi00598a008.,"['Salmeen I', 'Rimai L', 'Babcock G']",False
